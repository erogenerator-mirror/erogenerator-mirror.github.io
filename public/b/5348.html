But then he added, "What if the other girls are there with us?"</p> <p>"What? Are they?"</p> <p>"No, no, no, they are not," he replied. He thought it best to give it an equal opportunity to say its honest truth.</p> <p>"All right then. You have to do everything, no question, no hesitation."</p> <p>"No problem."</p> <p>"No," she insisted. "I already agreed to do it with you. And what harm will it do if I only ask you for this? If I don't want you to do it right?"</p> <p>"Absolutely not," he smiled. "I think it would just be nice to have a chance to have one of those experiences with you. Now, go do whatever you want to do."</p> <p>And with that, he turned back to his computer and went to bed.</p> <p>*****<>*****</p> <p>When she awoke in the early evening, it was dark. He had left her a note telling her that he was off at a job interview and had left her a nice envelope; he would never even be able to tell when he got back to her.</p> <p>She felt like a school girl, so she decided her evening was going to be very uneventful. All things considered, she had never once been alone with another woman, so it surprised her very much to be thinking about it, but she couldn't be entirely wrong. After she had showered, she put on a robe and joined the others outside.</p> <p>For the first time since she'd come over, she found herself staring at the door of the bathroom. She didn't know what she was looking at, but she was certain that she was staring at the body of a woman; it wasn't just the shower either, but the way the water cascaded over the two women. She'd always thought it had been another woman's breasts that had filled her fantasies even without being sexually exciting. But now she was standing here, holding her legs slightly open; she could see the curve of the lips of the woman's pussy, her entire body. She could also see both sets of womanhood, the two lips of their labia, the two clits -- two very hard clits.</p> <p>She felt like a naughty schoolgirl and she let her legs open as she watched them. Then she thought that she should do the same. She wasn't sure how to be casual about it, but she decided to let the emotions come. She didn't want to start feeling like she was looking at an exotic woman's body, so she let her gown fall to the floor and stepped out of it.</p> <p>She went to her bag and took what she considered the perfect outfit, the one that would give her a very sexy and erotic evening. It was the dress that would really show off her body -- especially when it was not covered by a bra. She knew that the fabric would hug at her breasts much lower than any bra, and it could be tight to show the shape of her nipples, and her ass. It was a lot shorter than anything she'd worn in the last few years. And it looked to her. And she felt like some teeny bit slut on the brink of exhibitionism. She really wanted to take something that she really wanted to wear on this special night ahead. And maybe something that she imagined would be the very next time she saw herself in that kind of dress.</p> <p>And she had plenty of time to think about it. Maybe she could talk to them about it later? Maybe they could talk to her about it tomorrow? Maybe they would make some sort of offer that was something she'd like to try. Whatever the consequences would be, she was going to do what was right for her first time with another woman. As much as she was having trouble imagining herself as a sexy, mature woman, she was determined that she would do it if it would make the most of her experience with a new lover.</p> <p>After showering, she put on the new gown with a very transparent bra. Then she put on the high heels and then the new bra that was just a thin piece of cloth. The heels and the heels made her already short skirt, which she still had, seem shorter than it was. She decided that she might as well get as close to nothing as she could with that in. The new bra seemed appropriate for the next little bit.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>And now, for the first time, in a long while, she was ready to see it. She felt like a teenager again, and then she saw it again in the mirror. It was a beautiful dress. It showed all of her to perfection. It had a simple beaded necklineâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
