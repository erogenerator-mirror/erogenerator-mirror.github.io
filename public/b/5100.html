The light pain was delicious and it didn't take but a few minutes of constant squeezing, and she had them really turned on. She could still feel my clit and her nipples.</p> <p>"Let go," she whispered in my ear.</p> <p>My lips came to within an inch of hers, our tongues began gently pushing against one another. "I have a little toy there. If you ever get me off, keep rubbing that clit while you make a pussy-dildo sound. Got it?"</p> <p>"Do it." I replied.</p> <p>I could feel her fingers working to loosen my sphincter, then her lips sucking it in slowly as her tongue gently slid around to stimulate. She worked them in and out. Her fingers stroking me just a little harder and faster. I was getting close, she could feel it. She squeezed harder still, she could feel how close it was. I could feel the muscles tightening, the tightness of her grip on my ass. Her tongue worked faster to my clit, and she brought a finger up to play with it. As the finger went in, she pushed it around in her mouth and pushed her tongue out as far as it would go. I could feel myself tense, I couldn't help it, I could not pull away. I was going nowhere. Her fingers pressed me to it. Harder than her lips worked my clit, and she continued to suck it, she was driving me to the very edge. I was totally out of control. I had no control at all. The feeling overwhelmed me. I was out of control. My whole world was centered on the pleasure, the feeling; I had no idea where I was. For a long long moment, I was barely aware of my surroundings.</p> <p>I let out a long "oh," and my body relaxed. The pleasure continued, more than just from my climax. It was so intense, so delightful. I knew the feelings couldn't last, even though I was going to cum any second, but one more little wave, an intense one and I would cum, just by doing it, with her there.</p> <p>My legs relaxed and my body started to relax, I was able to hold on. My arms fell to my side and I lay there and enjoyed the feeling of release. The feeling went on for quite some time. She kissed me, I kissed her, my hips, her breasts, her face. It wasn't long before I felt her hands moving to my hair, I knew they were massaging it as she kissed me and her fingers felt the hair on my chest and the muscles underneath. My body, still a little tingly, the sensation of being touched and kissed had slowly been replaced by the fullness of her body. Her nipple in my mouth was still hard. My body. I could feel her weight on me.</p> <p>She broke the kiss and slowly lowered herself down to my body. Her weight was enough for me to lift mine. She kissed every inch of my body. Her fingers played with my shoulders and neck. Then she went down. Her kisses went between my breasts then down my stomach then I felt her soft lips come to my pussy, she kissed it, licked it, and I felt the pleasure and satisfaction of being licked. She kissed the inside of my thigh, then up to my pussy, licking it. I lifted my leg to help her move, so I could feel her tongue. I felt her tongue go into me. "You taste so good." It was a long, soft, loving sound. I could feel it and it made me feel good too. It was so satisfying to be in control when someone else was doing it to me. I felt it all, all of me as my whole body surrendered in submission to her mouth and tongue. I was ready. I felt my muscles being opened to her, as a tongue worked its way up, down, in, out and I felt a tongue work itself up in my body and I got a feeling of pleasure and joy as every part of me was receiving it. The pleasure was intense. I felt the pleasure as it was washing through me. I felt the pleasure of my body, the feeling of her tongue inside me. I was completely out of control. I felt as though I was going to explode and it seemed to last, for a long period, but the feeling of pure pleasure swept over me. I felt as I was completely floating. It lasted for what seemed like forever. I was just a puppet for my own pleasure. It gave her pleasure to have complete control over me. I felt totally in charge, completely out of control, in a total surrender of myself to her. She felt it too, and moved on to my other leg and sucked my pussy again. Her tongue worked its way down, then up to my ass, which neverâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
