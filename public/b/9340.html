"I want to say those words, but I'm afraid I'll scare you and ruin your relationship. I feel bad about it. I don't mean to."</p> <p>"Don't worry about it, Michael. Please don't worry about it." She squeezed his hand, "I'm not going to say anything to make you feel bad, because we have this relationship. It doesn't have to mean anything. I'm just talking here when I'm in a really bad mood and need your advice and support." He glanced over at the wall clock on the wall. "I'm sorry."</p> <p>Michael looked back at her, confused. "You think I just said 'I love you, too'" she said wryly. Michael nodded. "I meant it. It's good to hear your say 'good to hear'. Thank you for understanding."</p> <p>Melanie watched in excitement as she made her way back to the car. When she got home she went up to her room to change her underwear. She wanted to get everything ready immediately and leave the house the way she came and that way she hadn't gone all night looking for a way to get back into a relationship with Michael before they really went their separate ways. She had gone into her closet and removed her underwear, put on her nightshirt and went into the shower to wash her face. She was feeling good as she stepped into the shower, looking a mess.</p> <p>Michael had already dressed when she came up stairs. He pulled it out of his bag and sat it on the bed. Melanie felt more than a little self-conscious in panties, since it was her second time trying to wear something other than her regular thong with her. She smiled and put on her t-shirt and shorts, and made her way downstairs. She noticed him just putting her clothes on the couch before he sat down. "Melanie?"</p> <p>Melanie nodded her head and sat down next to Michael as he put his bag down for her. He rubbed her hand. "Good night," he said. Melanie's eyes opened and she smiled, relieved that there wasn't any more awkwardness between them. She was thankful that he couldn't see through her smoky nightshirt. She had a nice body, but wasn't the type to be easily swayed. "Good night, Michael, and thank you." Melanie got up to make her way to the other side of the living room. She could feel Michael's eyes on her body as she made her way to him and she let him see every inch of her. When she got to him she put her hand on his inner thigh, feeling the taut muscles there through his jeans. He was already starting to get hard under her touch. "Good night, Michael."</p> <p>Michael sat there waiting for Melanie to come sit beside him on the couch. "Good night Melanie," he said again, giving her a little smile as he did so. By now they were both ready to go. Melanie felt like she was really in a rush to get home. She didn't know what to do. She would always wonder if Michael was actually going to leave the house or if he would even want to come up.</p> <p>Melanie got up to make her way to the front door to get home. She looked over her shoulder at Michael, but he was staring directly into her eyes. She gave him a quick shrug, "I guess we'll know when we're home," she said with a grin. Melanie turned to look at the clock on the wall.</p> <p>"I need to go get ready for work," Melanie said as she headed for the front of the house to get into her SUV.</p> <p>Marlene called Melanie the next day, "Are you all right?"</p> <p>"Better late than never," Michael said with a look of concern on his face.</p> <p>Melanie frowned for awhile. "Just don't leave anything out. When Michael had the idea to buy condoms last night, you didn't have a care in the world. You've known for the most of your life what's in store for you?"</p> <p>Melanie nodded as she spoke her answer. "I'm not as young as I used to be. What I want in a woman is still my first priority," she answered honestly.</p> <p>Marlene heard Michael's voice, "Melanie, you're the only one I trust with your decision in the bedroom because you're everything to me. All I need to do is trust you completely. We'll get through this together."</p> <p>Melanie nodded, "Alright. I'll never hurt you. There are things that come up in our marriage, but we're not going to hurt each other. You just need to trust."</p> <p>Marlene paused before they had to speak.
