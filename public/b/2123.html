A smile crosses her face as the sun continues to shine through the window.</p> <p>The car starts to move again, and she continues to watch the sky through the window, remembering how much better this summer would be.</p> <p>She starts to worry that the time had passed too quickly and she wanted to stop for gas and a quick shower, but there was a time constraint in this car.</p> <p>The car swerves around another curve, and it feels almost right to her. It feels so right.</p> <p>She waits for some time as its familiar feel fills her every cell of her being. She is so comfortable, so at ease. Her skin feels like a hundred soft fingers, but it washes against her. And it doesn't feel like the warm sun, but the cold and the heat of the night.</p> <p>The car passes another curve and she continues to wonder where they are at, how much further they are from the entrance to the park, and how far to the next curve.</p> <p>The car is slowing, but she continues to wonder if she is still taking the right direction. Its been so long since it got this hot. And when it does it feels as if it is burning for you.</p> <p>She reaches out, and touches it and then takes it herself. It is warm, soft, and yet so inviting. She has such an urge to just lay back and just sleep...but its not here, its here in the car. So she reaches out and caresses it, and then takes the tip of it in her hand and feels its hardness. She puts it in her mouth and slides in and out of it.</p> <p>It feels so good, and she loves every second of it sucking her cock into its warm wet mouth. A moan escapes her lips involuntarily as she makes herself cum at the thought of being able to do this forever. She sucks at it, then slides into the car and back, and then out to the entrance.</p> <p>He lights up from a little past, and she can feel the heat in her body, and she wonders if the cold breeze is touching her skin. She smiles and looks around wildly to see if she is being watched. Her eyes meet hers and she sees the hunger in them. It's just like her first time, and if it were that it would be a simple but very pleasurable climax for her.</p> <p>The car opens up, but there seems to be no other traffic. She turns her attention back to it. She slowly slips her wet fingers inside herself, sliding them in and out. She looks into the back of the car and looks around again. There is still no lights. There is nothing around her except the trees and the occasional passing motor.</p> <p>She slides the wet fingers from her body, and brings it to her mouth. She tastes herself there, and begins to lick her juices from her fingers as she continues to think about the experience.</p> <p>It is so good, and the thought of all those times where she had gone without and had just lost the feeling of that soft cock and the heat of being with it is too much. "Mmm," she thinks, "I don't know about that again." She continues to lick her fingers, then places them to her mouth and tastes herself. She is so wet and she tastes like a sweet wine to her, and she begins to slide it inside herself again, her fingers inside her.</p> <p>She reaches down and begins to caress herself again, as the thought is lost. It's just as good as she had imagined it would be, she thinks, and as she feels herself begin to cum, she wants more, and she pulls her fingers from her body and licks and sucks them both again. She then sits up straight to look again at the car and sees that there is still no sign of traffic.</p> <p>She pulls her wet body from the car, as it starts to turn around, and then starts to walk. She gets up onto the car, and looks at it. The cold air is cool but she doesn't care, and goes up to sit beside it. The driver's door opens, and she sees on his face a smile.</p> <p>He glances over at her and then smiles as she sits down next him between him and the car, and smiles back at him. After a moment he gets up to get himself some fresh air, and then walks back into the park.</p> <p>He gets the cooler off his car too, sets it on a little table, and then reaches for his favorite beverage. He passes her a mug.</p> <p>"Drink this," he says, holding it out for her. She is so happy to have a drink of fresh air, and she can't stop looking on at him as he drinks it and then sits on the bench and pulls his chair overâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
