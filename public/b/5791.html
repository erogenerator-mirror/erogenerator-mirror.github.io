Her hands took hold of his shaft and stroked him gently with her fingertips.</p> <p>He took her face in his hands and kissed her. She returned his fervent kiss with her lips, as gently as her hands could manage.</p> <p>She looked into his eyes and said, "Now make love to me, David. I have to have you inside me."</p> <p>She wrapped her legs around him and pulled him ontop of her. His erection easily slid into her and she moaned.</p> <p>"That feels so good," she whispered. She began to roll her hips and pushed back at him, wanting everything he felt.</p> <p>Soon, she had a steady rhythm going and the first wave of pleasure broke over her before she knew it. He drove into her hard; the sounds he made and felt, matched her pleasure. Her walls clenched around him and she screamed his name as another orgasm rocked her body.</p> <p>"Faster, David. Please," she moaned, "I love it when you put it right in me."</p> <p>She felt him thrusting against her in time with his own impending explosion. He could feel himself nearing a climax of his own as well, and he drove home even harder.</p> <p>"I'm going to come, David," he grunted, "Now!"</p> <p>She threw her head back, her eyes shut tight, as her own orgasm washed over her in waves of ecstasy. It was almost painless for her; the pleasure was mind blowing. David's erection throbbed at the base as he continued thrusting into her.</p> <p>"Oh, David!" he groaned. "Keep going. I'm coming!"</p> <p>When they both finished, David rolled to his back and pushed her onto her back. He mounted her and they made love like he had just done. The intimacy of the moment was unlike anything either of them had imagined.</p> <p>They lay on the bed, each lost in their own thoughts, until the ringing telephone startled them.</p> <p>"Hello?"</p> <p>"Who is this?" said a surprised mother. "Oh!"</p> <p>They stared at each other, dumbfounded.</p> <p>"I just finished what was on the radio," she continued. "Do you know the number?"</p> <p>"This is Julie Roberts?"</p> <p>"Yeah," she said. "I'm having some fun with David. I think we'll be seeing him when he comes back. Is she home?" She looked around her apartment. "What's she doing?"</p> <p>"I don't know, but she said she'll be home when he gets back, and I think he should call her so we can have a good time. He's just about to leave his truck for a friend of hers. They'll have lots of sex, and we'll do what they did."</p> <p>"Wow!" she squealed! "I don't know if I can get this on our second date!"</p> <p>"I'm sure we'll have time," he assured her. "In the meantime, we should order some pizza. Can you make it?"</p> <p>"Let's do it!" she agreed.</p> <p>After a shower, they went to their bedroom. David took off his robe and laid on the bed. She moved to him and began to kiss him with passion.</p> <p>"Do you always eat pussy?" said David.</p> <p>"Only when you're ready, and I can't wait until we do it again," she said. Then she kissed him again, and went down on herself. When he joined in, he put his penis in her vagina.</p> <p>They fucked in what seemed like an eternity. Their bodies were on fire, and they had missed the intimacy they were enjoying. It was the ultimate turn on. If they had an orgasm now, they were both ready for it later. David was insistent, driving himself into her with every bit of strength. Julie went wild on top of him, and began to cum herself.</p> <p>She moaned with passion while he plunged in and out of her from behind. She was on top of him, and he could feel her heart beat against his cheek. Their eyes met for a moment, and then he looked into hers and kissed her, as the ecstasy of their love flowed through them.</p> <p>He could feel her body tightening, and she started to go stiff, her body beginning to convulse. She groaned loudly, and David thought she might begin to scream his name.</p> <p>He held her as still as he could with her on top of him.</p> <p>"How long?" he asked.</p> <p>"How long is it, Davidâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
