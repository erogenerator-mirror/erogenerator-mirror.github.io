He grabbed the back of the seat and pushed it down. He turned for a moment and looked at her curiously.</p> <p>"Why'd you bring me with you?" she asked as she smiled. She started the car and started back out of town so as not to have to wait around, even with an older model car in the parking lot. "If it's okay if I go out alone, can you give me a ride?" she smiled up. "It's got everything I need, for the next 10 days, and I have a plane ticket to Honolulu in December." She said as she handed him the bag.</p> <p>"Great", the driver said cheerfully. He adjusted the gearshift, and he pulled away and down to the airport to pick up a flight back home in time to leave for the honeymoon. "Don't worry about it", he said softly as he leaned in to kiss her. "It'll be fun, alright?" she asked as she leaned in and gently squeezed his cock. "Of course, I'm always here for ya. I think I'll be alright then" she chuckled as she leaned in and kissed him. "Good luck", she whispered as he smiled and pulled away. A few moments later they pulled up to their hotel and she unlocked the door. She helped herself out of her jeans, and she wore only a matching bra. She slipped into his arms.</p> <p>"You've got a really sexy body", she moaned as she grabbed his hair. She pulled him to her and gently kissed him. He kissed her back just long enough to get the idea and then pulled away.</p> <p>"I have a good view over there", he smiled as he turned and walked toward the bed. "Here is where we go for our first time", he added just as she moved around the bed to make room. She turned and pulled back the blankets in the center of the bed and he slowly lowered the sheets. She leaned over and kissed him, running her hands over his body and then taking his dick in one hand.</p> <p>When he was hard, he guided her onto the bed, and lay on top of her. He kissed her deeply, then moved down a bit to run his tongue across her breasts. He licked her nipples softly as he moved his hips back and forth on her. He kissed from her chin down to the base of her neck, taking in her aroma. He began slowly to lower himself onto her, sliding his lips and tongue over her. He moved back up, kissing her neck and moving his way down her breasts, slowly but building the sensation. He sucked on her breasts gently as he slid a hand down her body to her hips. He ran his hand up and down her leg and across her mound. He felt a moist warmth slide past his fingers as he gently rubbed her clit. She began moaning, as she felt him move across her. He kissed down her back and under her breasts, and he kissed down her side to her navel. He kissed both sides of her mound lightly just as he lifted himself off of her. He sat up on his knees as she pushed her breasts in his face, feeling very sensitive. She leaned back a bit, her body arching in anticipation as she felt him begin to work himself into her. He began to run his hands over her body as he rubbed her clit for a while before leaning over and sliding himself into her and slowly began to thrust, moving his hips slightly as he leaned forward to kiss her again. His hands went to her hips and he slowly began to stroke into her. She felt a pressure building, as she slowly pushed back towards him. He began to thrust with more passion than the last time she'd had sex, and she pushed back towards him. He thrust into rhythm with her pushing into the rhythm. Her back arched as her hand slid up and back, meeting with his as he pumped into her.</p> <p>"Oh yes", she hissed as they moved together, their bodies moving together. The sound turned him on as he could feel her pulse racing down his cock. Her hands grabbed him and pushed him into her as he moved faster. Their bodies moved closer together and he felt her tense and then explode as she came, she screamed and bucked, as he thrust into her again as he shot his cum into her, his body sprawled on top of hers. Their lips kissed at first, and then they broke away after the feeling of orgasm passed. Both of their bodies lay on the bed with him still inside of her. He slowly pulled out and turned to put his dick in her hand. She looked at him, slowly and with longing. He slowly slid himself out of her and turned to kiss her. She held him tightly for a minute or two, and then pulled away.</p> <p>He pulled her over to the edge ofâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
