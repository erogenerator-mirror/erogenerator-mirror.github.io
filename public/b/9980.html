We went down the hallway and she pressed up against me as I pulled her to me. I felt her body and I caressed it as I pushed her face into my shoulder. "I love you, Jess," I said in a breathless whisper.</p> <p>She pressed herself against me as well and we walked hand in hand down the dark hallway. She stopped and turned toward me. I could see her eyes were glazed and her nipples were as hard as rocks. I kissed her and felt her lips touch mine. I felt her lean forward and slide her tongue into my mouth. I had no problem reciprocating this. She slid her hand down and I felt her grab my dick and begin tugging it. I reached around and took her right breast in my hand. Then I slid my hand down and slid my thumb over her pussy which was becoming more and more wet with each passing moment. After a few moments of fondling her tits with a finger, I pulled her back toward me and we stumbled the rest of the way down to the foot of her bed.</p> <p>She lay down on the bed and I straddled her with both hands. I bent down and kissed her. She kissed me back as my tongue made its intentions obvious. I kissed my way down her neck and she sighed slightly. I kissed and licked my way down from her ear down to her shoulder. She sighed more. I pulled her bra up off of her and reached under with my tongue. I licked the right side for a second and she lifted her head and I followed the left side. I started with her right breast and she cooed as my tongue slid across it. I licked the side of it as I slowly moved to the left side. I ran my hands over her tits, one cup and then the other.</p> <p>I moved my hands to the bottom and pulled and rolled the nipple between my wet fingers gently as I kissed the nape of her neck. She arched her back and leaned forward. I ran my tongue down her neck and licked the side of her breast as I rolled my hand around her nipple. I could feel it as it hardened into a tiny nub and was pushing at my fingers. I sucked her nipple into my mouth while running one finger over the nub. I could feel her moan and moan as she let her head go back. I moved my mouth to the other side of her and repeated that process.</p> <p>She reached out and ran her fingers through my hair as I flicked her nipple once more. She was wet as I slid up and lay over her and pressed my hard dick onto her waiting clit. I pushed back as I felt it pressing to the inside of my legs. We broke our kisses for a moment and I looked down at her.</p> <p>Her eyes flashed as she looked down at me and she started to rub herself in anticipation. I moved up and slid my dick into her. I was careful where I was going in and out; I wanted to feel each ridge and each bump against my dick. I leaned back and grabbed my dick and moved it to the side of her pussy. I pushed it all the way into her and she moaned. We kissed one long moment and looked each other in the eye. She moved her legs around as I continued to slowly push in a few more inches. The feeling was electric and she was breathing hard as I moved slightly out and pushed back in a little bit. We kissed for a few moments, letting our tongues dance.</p> <p>I pulled out of her slowly and she pulled me onto her. I kissed her again and rolled my legs over and around so we were facing each other. I pushed my dick between her legs which were now holding my body together. I put an arm around each of hers and slid my arms around and around to her front. I pulled her close and kissed her and felt her put her arms around my head. We kissed in slow motion as if we were moving with slow motion, our arms around each other. She slowly moved both of her legs around so that her clit was rubbing around it with each motion I made. Finally, I pulled away from her lips and she moved her mouth to mine.</p> <p>For a fleeting second, I was afraid that she was about to cum again. Instead, she pulled back again and pulled me on top of her. She pulled me hard against her as our chests pushed together. "Make love to me baby," she said. I reached down and rubbed the top of her pussy as I slid my arms straight up and around her legs. I pulled her legs out and up to my shoulders and looked down at her. Her arms were still around my neck and her head was nestled into my shoulder.</p> <p>I lowered myself down and let her body lie there as I leaned down to kiss her again. I could feel her hands pushing backâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
