I asked incredulously.</p> <p>"My mother's a fucking fucking bitch," Amy replied with a sigh. "I had a crush on her, but she wouldn't even let me date, let alone any meaningful boyfriends. She made me do stuff, I swear."</p> <p>I had been angry when Amy came to town, but I had quickly learned to control my temper and forget about it. That wasn't going to stop me from trying to figure it out.</p> <p>"How did you and Amy get to where?" I asked.</p> <p>"We both worked, as a team at a local school, at the same time."</p> <p>"I'm not taking that on you," I said, getting upset. "You know that Amy's mother was the best mom in the world."</p> <p>"Oh, fuck," Amy said. "You don't know."</p> <p>"I know."</p> <p>We had been going back and forth for the past six months, and when Amy and I started to talk about our parents, we knew what each other was thinking. The more we talked, the more we agreed to talk for several weeks.</p> <p>"Listen, honey," I began. "When you went off to college this semester, you didn't realize that you still had a crush on me. I know it sounds dumb to you but you're still a virgin."</p> <p>"I know," Amy responded. "But I still wonder how it would taste to have something warm and moist inside of you."</p> <p>"Oh, fuck," I said. "I'm going to regret this, Amy. I really do. Especially if I get the chance to watch you with other men."</p> <p>"You don't," she said calmly. "And if you do, I'll come right back at you when you try to move past me. No, I'm not going to leave you hanging."</p> <p>"Okay," I said reluctantly.</p> <p>"It's okay, honey," she assured me. "I just want to get a look at your cock before I do anything. Can we move on?"</p> <p>We started talking about our families, my girlfriends, and I told her about my sister. Amy asked if I could tell her about my girlfriend, and that I had to know they were swingers, and that had to be the best part of the whole story.</p> <p>When I told Amy I had no idea how we wanted to do this, she just told me.</p> <p>"Are you serious?" she asked, surprised. "Don't you worry, Amy, I have got you hooked. But first, I'm going to have to do this one-on-one with you. I've got to find someplace to park it so we can go somewhere that'll make it. I can only go so quick, and you're still going to like the idea.</p> <p>"You're sure about this?" I asked. "Besides, it probably makes it easier for me to see you if I want you to know something."</p> <p>I had been so nervous about this, I nearly broke down crying when she handed me the letter the next morning. We both knew we hadn't really talked since then, but Amy was the one who set it up, and in the end, she went for the most passionate kiss I had ever received in my life.</p> <p>I could feel the cum on my leg as we finally parted ways. It wasn't nearly as bad as what I had just done, but it was definitely more intense.</p> <p>~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*</p> <p>I was looking down into my beer when I heard a noise come from down the stairs.</p> <p>It was the last person I was expecting.</p> <p>There's something about the way that the door opens and I see one man sitting on the edge of my bed.</p> <p>"Hi, Mike!!"</p> <p>Even the sound of the name ringed through my head, and for a moment, I thought I may have said one thing for what had seemed so long. I knew what that meant. I knew that I'd just never really gotten over just kissing. But then...</p> <p>"Who the hell are you?" I heard him say to me, almost too loud. Then I realized what had to be his sister.</p> <p>"Uh, hey, Jen," I said nervously as he stepped closer.</p> <p>"It's good to see you, Mikeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
