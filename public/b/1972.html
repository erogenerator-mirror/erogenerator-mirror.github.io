I heard the conversation downstairs. I'll just leave him to it."</p> <p>"No. Please don't take this the wrong way. I just feel a bit weird."</p> <p>"What? I'm not the kind of girl that will fuck anybody."</p> <p>"I like to fuck. And that's all that matters."</p> <p>"Then I guess I am very flattered." I said in my most sultry tone.</p> <p>We locked the car and walked to the back of the shop where the door was unlocked. Alex walked behind me, looking at my tight short dress.</p> <p>"I really don't approve of this," He said, as Alex pulled up my dress.</p> <p>Alex's grip on my ass was firm, and I felt the cold of the coldness of the concrete on my bare skin. He pushed the door open without even knocking, and inside was quite a large bathroom, dominated by three large sinks. He opened the door, and entered my bathroom, shutting the door behind him. The water heater was off, but the fixtures were clean and clean. I leaned against the wall, my back against it. My heels clicked across my wet dress and ass.</p> <p>"That's a girl," Alex whispered to me.</p> <p>"Who is it?" I asked.</p> <p>"It's a girl named Julie."</p> <p>I heard the door open, and closed it again a few seconds later.</p> <p>"Who is it?" I repeated for him.</p> <p>"Julie, your friend."</p> <p>"Fuck! Julie is in here."</p> <p>"Julie was supposed to get a few minutes off from work. This is why we got into this place? We don't have time to take care of your girl friend all day."</p> <p>"I'm not that kind of girl," Alex chuckled softly. "And I doubt you'll like it either!"</p> <p>He moved back and began to undress himself.</p> <p>"You can do better than that," I whispered. "Julie's a good little fuck, and you don't have to worry about how long this takes. You can fuck me all you want. After all, we're a long way from home. You can even use that little cock of yours in me. You can cum in me, and you'll never be able to get enough."</p> <p>I put out my hand for him to take out of his pants. He grabbed it, and then pulled me down onto his lap. He kissed me, his tongue tracing the seam of my lips as his erection hardened inside me. He then grabbed my ass and pulled my hips into him. We both moaned.</p> <p>"You're sure you really are just a girl."</p> <p>"Shut up you," I replied. It felt so good to talk with Alex. Julie was so gorgeous, and I could fuck her forever in just a few minutes.</p> <p>"Yes, you are a girl," he said softly. "And not just Julie. But you're also going to want a long, hard fucking tonight."</p> <p>I could feel my own climax approaching, even though my pussy was already on fire. He moved me off of his lap and started kissing me once more. His tongue was hot in my mouth, and I moved against it, running my hands over his chest.</p> <p>"I can see why you have the hots for her."</p> <p>"She's not that pretty."</p> <p>"I know. I was afraid she wouldn't like you."</p> <p>"I bet she loved you!"</p> <p>"She already did. She came here, like she always does at these parties. She came to get some sun."</p> <p>My hand rested on his hard cock, moving it up and down.</p> <p>"I bet she is going to come back for more," I whispered.</p> <p>"You're so sweet. I can't wait," he whispered as he pulled away from me, and then walked straight toward the closed door.</p> <p>I giggled at my own joke, because my hands had drifted down to my thighs, and my skin was already burning. I couldn't believe I had said that. I wasn't that good of a friend, no matter what we did.</p> <p>"So," he said finally, as he opened the door. She was in the bathroom by then, her head down, the light shining through the bathroom door. Her hair was still wet, but her makeup was otherwise perfect. She was not dressed in a sexy little red dress, or even a bikini, but a loose fitting red tank top with nothing underneath. Her breasts were barely covered, and she was so slender and elegant, it was hard not to feel at home with her. She smiled as she walked through the door, her body shaking a bit.</p> <p>"Hi, Julie," She said, her eyes dancing in front ofâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
