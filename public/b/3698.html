Her touch was gentle and it made my body respond. I knew that she was feeling all this too. Her skin caressing mine. Her lips brushing mine and our own tongues fighting. I was in a trance. She whispered that she wanted to, too. I almost forgot the others in the room or that she was not aware of us being at the pool. She pulled me from the chaise where I had been sitting and went to the edge of the pool. I was left standing, in awe of the water, alone with her; at a point I thought I could not look away. She bent, so that she could touch me: her skin, skin from the bottom to the top.</p> <p>She stroked my cock and stroked my balls; I leaned back on my hands and moaned as she began to take my ass, gently, slowly and firmly, with her other hand. I knew that it wasn't going to take much to get me off – with her, though, in this room, there was little to lose. She wanted me to cum now, in the water in front of everyone; she wanted me to spray the walls of the pool every time she cupped my ass and my own orgasm crashed through me. I don't know how long I stood in this warm and sensual embrace. I did not notice that she had pulled the sheet down to expose my back; however, she had made every last bit of movement. She sat me down on the couch, which was now next to the pool, and we kissed in the warm, fresh water, our hands caressing each other, feeling the softness and the heat, my cock rising to full hardness and her legs getting wet and slippery between them.</p> <p>We were breathing together, our hearts pounding, our souls searching and searching for something. I broke our embrace and she stood, leaning back against the edge, her arms at her side. I stepped between her legs again as I undid the buttons on the loose shirt. Her nipples were dark on the left side and the right nipple was standing proudly, swollen and pink. She reached out to touch the flesh of my cock to the underside, causing me to thrust my cock into the air; she smiled. She guided my hand under the shirt, to the nipple I had found and started to rub it. She turned toward me and pushed my head down to the end of the couch. I went with her and we kissed again, our breasts pressing together, her hands wandering my neck, my shoulders. Suddenly she took my earlobe in her teeth and began to hum low and heavy. I let my tongue play with the side of her nipple, the one between her lips and my fingers playing with her other nipple. I held her head as we kissed each other as I moved to a kneeling position and began kissing her left nipple in turn. She kissed the nipple again and then moved to the right, slowly, licking and sucking. When I kissed the side of her left tit I moved to her right to repeat the sensation.</p> <p>And when I kissed the nipple it grew and hardened in my mouth. The skin of her breasts were firm and the nipples were dark, pink and swollen in the dim light. I pulled her to me, our bodies touching, feeling each other, trying to get all of the sensation. I felt her hand slide to rest on my thigh and her fingers, slippery with her slippery saliva, ran softly up my thigh to the waistband of my shorts. She took the waistband in her fingers and rubbed a bit of her saliva up the length of my cock and pulled it upward toward her hand with my cock between it, which she brought upward between us. I was hard, throbbing, feeling the heat in its tip and a swelling in my balls. She slipped the cock into her hand, stroking it and rubbing it and then, once more, with her moist hand, stroked me. She squeezed my cock and stroked me until I felt my cock harden and push higher in her hand. I let my head fall forward, against her cheek and we kissed again, our hands roaming all over each other's bodies.</p> <p>When I kissed between her breasts, my lips were on the nipple, my tongue playing with it as I kissed around her areolas. I kissed down her belly, down toward her navel, over her bellybutton and down to her mound. Our kisses moved to her thighs and I spread her legs, exposing the wet lips of her pussy and the pink inner flesh of her vagina. I touched her lips with my thumb and she let me press my thumb on her upper lip as I slipped her thumb under her. I pressed my thumb into her, so that her clitoris was more pronounced, more exposed and more pronounced. When I pressed my thumb harder against its top tip of her clitoris it became more pronounced and more pronounced. I pressed her thumb—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
