You are so cute." He turned towards me as we approached her table. The waiter approached from the other end of the bar and took our drink orders. I took a sip of my soda, savoring the taste. I felt the alcohol beginning to take effect, as it was starting to have a different effect. I began to feel better.</p> <p>At the table, the waiter brought our drinks with an extra twist. He placed the glasses to the side and leaned over to take their order. She was drinking water. I saw her look over at me as he left the room. I smiled back at him and took another sip. I watched her mouth the top of my glass as it emptied its contents. She then looked up at me, smiled and winked.</p> <p>I took another sip as he reached for our glasses, but she grabbed my arm and held me tight and guided me towards her. She took my hand and kissed my fingers.</p> <p>"I'm glad you liked the surprise," she whispered.</p> <p>"Of course, I did. I could do without a drink," I replied.</p> <p>"I was hoping you wouldn't give me one," she kissed my lips and then leaned on my shoulder and we kissed for another minute. Her lips were soft and inviting. I was hard in no time. There was little we could do but let her do what she wanted. Our lust was intense.</p> <p>"I think we are going to have to do both," she giggled and grabbed my crotch. I stood up and walked toward her. I grabbed her right arm and spun on her. In one motion, we reached the top of the bar. It was completely empty. I looked at her and smiled. "If you let me do a little shopping while I'm at it, I might not feel so naked."</p> <p>She giggled then looked at me with her gorgeous mouth stretched into a smile and nodded. I pulled her up and we walked to the end of the bar.</p> <p>"I still need these shoes but you like the shoes right?" she asked as she lifted her feet.</p> <p>I reached around her and handed them to her. The sole color was red. She smiled and dropped them on the floor. I walked around to the side of the bar. "I'm getting us our drinks," I said, handing off our drinks to both of us.</p> <p>"Let's go into that dressing room," She said. She pushed me down on the stool and knelt in front of me. The music was playing softly in the background and she pushed my skirt up and started licking my pussy. Oh, God. I felt light headed and light-headed.</p> <p>"I want that shirt off," I said softly and unbuttoned my black shirt. I pulled the top of my skirt down to my knees. Now it was my turn. I took her hand and placed it on my bare skin. I pushed my tongue into her mouth hard and then turned her around and pulled on her long red hair so that she would be in front of me. I took her hands and grabbed her ass as I bent forward and grabbed her tits.</p> <p>With my tongue dancing between her lips and against her throat, I pushed her hand down between her legs and felt two fingers probing her pussy as I sucked her tongue. I pulled her panties down as she lifted her hips. My hands went to her ass and we both came to a stop in front of her. It wasn't enough. I put my hands on her hips to push her onto my cock. She lifted her ass up onto the seat, took my cock, and guided me into her dripping wet pussy. I was in her all the way. Then we both went on our hands and knees and made love to her. Our bodies moved into a rhythm as I moved her up and down over my cock. "Oh, Baby, I never imagined I'd be this good. I wish that my life would have been like this," she whispered.</p> <p>"My life will never even slow down at one time," I said, knowing. I held onto her butt while she slowly fucked her. We were both close to our peak. I reached down to her breast, but she put her hands behind her so that I wouldn't pull it away. I leaned so the pressure on my pussy was more intense. The music stopped and we both stood there looking at the crowd below us. We felt the sexual energy build and knew we were close. I pushed her up to look down at me. "Are we safe?" she asked.</p> <p>"We're almost there," I heard herself say. "Oh, yeah."</p> <p>"That was the most erotic moment I have had in months." She said.</p> <p>"It was the most sexually powerful orgasm I've had in months," I replied.</p> <p>"I'veâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
