"Let me wake her up. I don't want her sleeping in the dark. It's really dangerous out here in the late morning."</p> <p>The last she'd been up, the first hour had gone by in a blur, and in the morning had come back to take our place under the starlight.</p> <p>I couldn't sleep either and tried all sorts of things to cover my eyes, but I'd just about woken her up with a yawn, and she'd had to put fresh sheets on her.</p> <p>"This feels like an eternity!" she said, coming back into the room. "No one has ever done this..." She looked around and saw the bed, so, rather than go ahead and take it, I laid next to her. She reached her head over me for a kiss, and we stayed, like long lost friends.</p> <p>"What do you want?" she said.</p> <p>"I want a little privacy," I said. "I just know I should have let you sleep with me last night."</p> <p>"It was just a little bit of fun," she said, sitting up on the bed. "I don't mind. Besides, I like it there, under the stars." She grinned as she pulled me on top of her. "Maybe we can just go home now?" she said, nuzzling me in the arm.</p> <p>"I don't think so," I replied, kissing her gently. "I don't think I'd want someone else."</p> <p>And with that, she fell asleep. As sleep came, I pulled herself out from under the covers, and, once she was asleep, I started the car.</p> <p>When I pulled out of the parking lot, it felt like a dream. The night was warm and peaceful, and I felt good. Before I turned onto State Route 17, I took another route that wound down the highway. Not too far at all.</p> <p>I felt a little guilty as I drove past where some of their neighbors hung out. There was one place we'd passed the day before, where a couple of neighbors had hung out just a little, while one house had been open for a couple of weeks. This part of the town was pretty deserted, and I didn't think they'd be doing any more shopping in the morning. I stopped the car just outside one of them, and parked in the closest spot. I was a little worried about the neighbors - there were four houses on our right - but I was careful to take precautions.</p> <p>"So what time do you want to get your clothes off?" I said. "I haven't finished stripping down yet. It's going to be a good time to take your clothes off, too."</p> <p>"I don't know," she said. "I feel kind of exposed. I haven't been naked in a while. I didn't think anybody would mind."</p> <p>I pulled out of the lot and rolled onto my side. "Do you mind if I take off my shorts and shirt?" I asked. "I don't think they'd mind at all."</p> <p>"Sure," she said, turning off the headlights and getting out of the car. She pulled her shirt off, and I took off my clothes, too. Once she was out of her t-shirt, she was as naked as I was.</p> <p>"Wow," she said. "I never knew a town like this existed. I feel the same way. I guess being naked here...it must have been really good."</p> <p>"You are, too," I agreed. "It was a lot of fun, wasn't it?"</p> <p>"Not really. But, I'm glad you liked it. At least you enjoyed the show."</p> <p>"I did. I've only done it when I was single, and I wanted more than having to strip. It felt really exciting for me to get naked with another man. I don't know why I'd have to do it again, though."</p> <p>"Don't worry about it," I assured her. "You're going to have a great life here. Everyone will know you're there by Sunday." I started the car and we headed back.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>I was driving to the house, when the back door suddenly burst open. The light was on, and the porch light was off, too. It was the neighbor's daughter who had appeared inside that night. It appeared, too, while they stayed in the house. They looked in their front room, all the way down to the bottom of the stairs, and they were looking at me in the mirror. It was the first time they'd seen each other.</p> <p>"Hurry!" yelled the woman as she came down the stairs at me. As she did, a naked man was at the top of the stairs, holding their clothing.
