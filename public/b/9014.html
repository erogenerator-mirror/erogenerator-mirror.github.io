That would be nice," she said quietly once, as she turned towards the toilet, "Oh, and one more thing, don't even think of calling back!"</p> <p>With a groan of despair, she bent forward over the toilet, resting both hands on the basin and looked away, her face flushed bright red.</p> <p>"No. Don't," she said again.</p> <p>She felt him standing behind her, touching the small of her back. Her knees were open so he could slip a finger easily inside her. That felt good. Her clitoris was standing proud, swollen and excited with a life of its own.</p> <p>"God!," she murmured. She heard him sigh and move his fingers in small circles, rubbing the tip of his tongue over the little button.</p> <p>"Oh, God!" she cried. It was so naughty.</p> <p>"You're a dirty girl," he said. "We didn't have to do much!"</p> <p>He had undone his tie and his dark brown hands were exploring her body as deeply as he could, and he had also opened the buttons just a little, drawing a gasp from her.</p> <p>"I need you," she said again. "I need you!"</p> <p>"No, you need not say anything. I can't help you."</p> <p>His mouth nuzzled her neck, kissing and licking there before he began to thrust his cock inside her. It felt like heaven. Aching for the sensations she had experienced earlier, the pleasure she had felt in herself earlier. She wanted it to go on and on, until she screamed.</p> <p>"God, you're so tight," he whispered in her ear. He had slid his cock all the way into her and, as she had done earlier, he was balls deep in her wet passage. She shivered with pleasure with the sensation it was causing - and even with the cold air on her overheated skin.</p> <p>"It's so hot inside," she murmured. "I want you in me - all of you - in my body - inside me!"</p> <p>His tongue probed her ear again, as he started hammering into her. She felt like there would be a second coming on before he exploded in her. He knew and he liked it. He was about to cum. He wanted to push that hard, deep and hot cock deep into her, pushing her body into the bed with every thrust. This was how he wanted it. Hard and deep and to cum deep inside her. God it felt good.</p> <p>At last she felt his balls tighten, pressing against her. He came inside her, filling her up. Their two bodies pressed against each other. He collapsed on her. She felt the warmth of him around her, between her legs. It had been a good experience. He was going to fuck her for the first time, hard and strong. No more hiding. If this was how she wanted it, they got it. They had done it. She had become a slut.</p> <p>He kissed her passionately.</p> <p>"What was that?" she asked him. This had never happened before. He didn't understand what she was talking about but he knew the answer.</p> <p>"I think you wanted to hear me moan," she replied, her voice quiet and sweet. "You wanted to see what I was feeling."</p> <p>"You were saying that?"</p> <p>"And what did you mean, about being with the other woman?" she whispered, pulling his head to hers. He didn't speak but he kissed the tip of her nose.</p> <p>"That's right," he said. "I was saying that I loved you and I wanted to go to sleep with you - that we would do everything together tonight."</p> <p>"And what did you mean?" she asked him, and he kissed her nose.</p> <p>"When I was first with you, I was having an orgasm," he whispered. "I was masturbating to you - and I came at the same time as you did - and we watched each other."</p> <p>"And did it please you?" she whispered.</p> <p>"It pleased me," he told her. "And I want you, too." Their eyes met briefly.</p> <p>She could see his face flushed and he reached for her. They embraced in the dim candlelight. His fingers tangled in her hair, guiding her head to the side. They kissed a moment, while he caressed her breast with the pad of one finger. Finally, he drew back and looked at her. She had a look in her eyes that said, "Did I hurt you?" She nodded.</p> <p>"No," he said. "I enjoyed it. It felt great."</p> <p>"I don't know, and I don't care!
