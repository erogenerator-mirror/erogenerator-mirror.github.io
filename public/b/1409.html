She swallowed him whole without spilling a drop and she did her best. She kept doing that until he began his fourth of his five climax. All three were going over the top when he pulled her up on top of him and began to fuck her hard and fast.</p> <p>As his cock began to explode inside of her, he came so hard it actually pushed her off the bed, but she kept sucking on it, still coming on his cock with her face in his pubes. When he finally finished, he pulled off of her and pulled his shorts up and buttoned them. He looked down at himself and smiled at her and said, "Now I should get going." They both knew that they didn't have to, but they were going to get together soon to see what he had to say.</p> <p>As she got up to leave, she turned around and kissed him hard, then said, "Wait!" as she walked to the door. John had just walked in, just then Kate turned around and said, "You're next".</p> <p>Kate looked in the other room and saw John standing there. She took a deep breath, looked at his clothes and then walked down the hall towards him. She knelt on the stairs as he stood there. John looked up and smiled at her. As Kate stood up, he pulled her into his arms and kissed her. As he broke the kiss, he lifted her up up and kissed her again and she moaned as he kissed her. Kate was so horny she was going crazy as she ran her hands over John's arms and down his chest and her hands came back up to caress his chest.</p> <p>John pulled back from the kiss and as he looked down at her, he got up and said, "Let's get dressed. I thought I might use the bathroom myself. I'll get us a beer, will you?" He smiled at her and asked her to remove her clothes. Once she was naked, he began undressing. Finally he had his clothes off and then looked down at her and said, "I don't know about you, but I'm more relaxed today than yesterday."</p> <p>Kate looked up at him and said, "I'm glad you feel like going and getting dressed. I can't wait to see the rest of my outfit." She smiled and took his hand and they walked down the hall to the bedroom. Once they got out of the bedroom, she put her arms around his neck and gave him a peck and said, "I don't go naked, I'm all for that."</p> <p>John laughed and said, "Just a little show, and maybe another time. I'll take as long as you want."</p> <p>Kate got off of the bed and then turned around. John just looked at her body and saw that she was as sexy as ever, so he decided that it wasn't going to be another day.</p> <p>Kate saw a big pile of clothes lying on the nightstand and said, "Do you want to have a look at this, too?"</p> <p>John told her, "Just go over there, on the bed. There is something else in there. I'll tell you what I have in mind."</p> <p>Kate just looked back at his cock and said, "I think I have a couple more things I have to do first." She then went into the night stand, pulled out her thong, grabbed a pillow, threw them on the floor and walked to the bed. She laid down on the bed again and said, "This is very sexy, but it might just be too much for you."</p> <p>John just looked at her. "Let's just let us do what we would have done had you been naked. I'm not sure where we would have found a more suitable place for it, but I guess it is pretty safe."</p> <p>Kate put both their panties on and then threw them on the bed next to John's cock. Then she got on the bed on her stomach. Finally, John got off the bed. He sat on the bed and looked at her. He reached behind her and put his hands under her shoulders. When they were out of the way, John slowly began to lift her naked body up off of the bed. As he got higher, he stopped when his hands ran over her hips and down her legs. He continued up until he reached her ass and as he raised her again, he stopped before he reached her pussy. When he was in reach, he stopped once again.</p> <p>Again, he started by running his hands all over the entire back of her ass and back. When he could, he pulled the cheeks apart. He stopped once again as he looked at her butt. Kate lifted her head to see him staring at her bare cheeks. They were so beautiful. Then he slowly lowered his head and ran his tongue overâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
