My body was shaking so badly that my hands shook in frustration. I felt my legs weakening and trembling. My head was spinning. What was he doing? Was that his plan? I couldn't see him now. I closed my eyes tightly shut as I tried to hold on as best I could. I couldn't move.</p> <p>The music stopped and the lights behind the door came back on. He slowly left the room followed by the music to reveal the two men working in a room not too far from where we were standing. We remained standing around the outside of the curtain. The two men looked up at me from their work, both smiling as they continued to watch us. The man who had led us in stood, smiling as he looked back from where he was standing.</p> <p>The man closest to us smiled even bigger. He looked up at us. "I'm so glad you're here," he said, "You really took the time to bring in the money."</p> <p>"I didn't bring up the money, but I brought it tonight," Jake added.</p> <p>"Oh, come on," Jake said, "I got to know your client on the phone today. The money doesn't come until tomorrow. He's in this room." The men behind me stepped towards me. My body shook as they approached. I had never felt so nervous and excited on the phone today. I had never taken such a huge risk, but I felt like they might actually come.</p> <p>The man closest to me turned his head to watch me. "The money looks good enough," he said. He then nodded towards the curtain. "I'm afraid you have to get away before that little boy here gets a hard-on," he mused. "Maybe we could use him for something." He grinned as he said this.</p> <p>The man closest to me turned to smile at him again. "If the money is good enough, then maybe he should get to know the money better," he said. "I'm sure your husband is the last one around." The man closest to me smiled back at him.</p> <p>The man closest to the door stepped forward and started pulling it open. Jake and I watched as the curtain slid back to free my feet. Jake and I were stunned that anyone would do that.</p> <p>The man next to Jake pulled the curtain back exposing me to the light from the overhead light. The man behind me put his hands down to my shoulders. He looked at me like I was just another doll on the screen of a bad television program. He smiled as he said, "You know we're going to have to take a risk, right?" He moved his hands down to start untying my robe.</p> <p>"I don't care," I replied. I was now in a half stupor as the man untied my robe, letting it drop to my lap. I tried to cover my nudity by covering mine with my arms and legs. The robe fell to the floor as the man reached down to start untying my shoes.</p> <p>I had no time to catch my breath as the robe fell to the floor. It was very easy to keep it on over my eyes. My head was reeling. I had never done anything like this before. The stranger looked at me in the mirror and laughed. I could no longer look at his face. I looked down and could just tell that my nipples had hardened and were starting to poke through my sheer black bra and my thin bathing suit. Just looking at him, it was apparent to me that I was about to have some strange adventures that were to happen in no way as unpleasant as he had seemed.</p> <p>"Well?" the man behind me asked again. He had lifted my robe up a few inches to expose my ass. It felt so warm and inviting. The other man's fingers had opened my outer lips to expose my dark pink inner lips. He had his fingers inside me, as I felt two of his fingers slip inside me. I had never felt so complete and complete before in my life.</p> <p>"Please don't," I begged. "We're not going to go there," I whispered. "Please stop!" I cried out as one of the stranger's fingers slipped inside me. He was moving slowly inside me.</p> <p>"Are you sure you're okay?" he asked as he put his hands back on my shoulders. His fingers were so hot inside me as he stroked my inner lips.</p> <p>"God, yes. Keep doing that," I pleaded with him. I started to grind my pussy against the stranger's fingers. We watched as he slipped a third finger inside me and began finger-fucking me. He was smiling as he stared at my body with such intensity. It made me feel like my pussy seemed just a little bit warmer. I closed my eyes as the stranger's fingers gently movedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
