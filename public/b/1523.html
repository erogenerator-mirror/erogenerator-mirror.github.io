"Are you thinking about letting your lover fuck your ass?"</p> <p>"Yes, yes oh god yes! I want you to fuck my ass. I want you to take my ass!"</p> <p>"How much longer?"</p> <p>"Fifteen seconds."</p> <p>"And why was that?"</p> <p>"I want you to take your sweet time," I replied.</p> <p>"You know how difficult it is to get off so easily."</p> <p>In one hand, I had a pair of scissors and a finger, and, with the other, I had an ice cube.</p> <p>He laughed as he picked it up from the table.</p> <p>"What's that?"</p> <p>"Mmmm, I think there's some driedness here."</p> <p>He snipped the hair from his shoulder. A few seconds later, I put the sharp edge between my lips and pushed it inside, sucking on it and enjoying the taste. With another swipe of the blade, he slid the razor under my neck.</p> <p>"I told you, you're going to have to trust me."</p> <p>"I do trust you."</p> <p>"Good. Now let's get it over with. Remember the last time we did this on the couch?"</p> <p>"That was a little more than two minutes ago," I replied.</p> <p>"I was going to take a little longer this time, but I promised you I was going to go slowly. How did you make it past three minutes?"</p> <p>"I had no idea until you kissed me like that, and it felt right," I replied. "That felt so good."</p> <p>"I want you to promise me something."</p> <p>"What's it, baby?"</p> <p>"Promise me."</p> <p>"Do you understand?"</p> <p>"Of course I understand."</p> <p>I looked at him quizzically, and he reached for me, grabbing my head with one hand. He lifted my chin, and kissed me.</p> <p>"I'm gonna open your mouth wider now. I'm gonna get down to business with you."</p> <p>"OK."</p> <p>He began kissing down my neck again. His hands moved up my chest. I couldn't stop him.</p> <p>"Yes, that's good," I said.</p> <p>He was working his way to the center of my breasts.</p> <p>"Are you sure?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Okay. That's good."</p> <p>Next thing I feel is a warm tongue licking my right breast, with no teeth. He's holding the breast and pressing it into the corner of my mouth. Oh, how I love that sensation! He's licking and sucking on my nipple, which instantly responds to his touch by raising and relaxing, and the nipples grow harder. I'm wondering when he's going to do the next move. He releases the breast, then slips his tongue back inside, and continues moving slowly down my belly, leaving my navel, which I've been dreaming for so long. My breath comes in short gasps, and my thighs move with his hand. I hope he doesn't notice.</p> <p>He does not.</p> <p>His tongue moves over my pussy. His head is resting at the entrance of it. He slowly lifts and opens the lips, and moves a finger inside. "Is my baby ready," I think.</p> <p>"You are so beautiful," he exclaims.</p> <p>I am just as ready to explode as he is.</p> <p>He moves his fingers deeper inside me, in and out, slowly.</p> <p>"Baby, do something with those fingers," I ask, and I take his cock by surprise.</p> <p>"Do what?"</p> <p>"Touch me," I tell him, and he takes a second finger, and slips it easily into me. "What are you doing?"</p> <p>"I'm going to finger you," he says. "It's like having a little cock."</p> <p>He begins moving his hand around me, sliding along the outer area of my vagina, making it slick with my juices. I moan with pleasure, and then ask him if he is going to fuck me.</p> <p>He laughs as he stands and starts to take off his briefs. I can't move, and I just want to take anything he can give me.</p> <p>"Turn around," he says.</p> <p>I do as I'm told, then he pulls me closer to him again. He starts kissing my stomach, working his way slowly down toward my pussy. I love the feel of his lips on me when his tongue gently slides along my lips. He kisses around my clit, and back, and moves slowly down to my inner thighsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
