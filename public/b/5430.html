She had her hair in pigtails and smiled as she saw the bottle of lotion out.</p> <p>"Hey, Caitlyn," she called softly, "You've got to be fucking beautiful. How'd you like it, my husband?"</p> <p>"I'm okay. I was just lying here for a minute, listening to you guys. I can't believe how sexy you look, and I'm ready too, though, not right now. I hope you're not mad, because we're done."</p> <p>"Of course not. We're done. I just want you inside me, with me riding your big cock. I really want that!"</p> <p>"What's going on?" I asked, "What you two are doing?"</p> <p>"No honey. Don't get your hopes up for me until you see what I want."</p> <p>Oh, Caitlyn, she wanted so bad. I want you to let her ride you. Oh, sweet Caitlyn, I want your tight little cunt to ride it. I want the whole fucking length of your big cock in it. I want every bit of you in it. Make love to me, with me on top of you. Fuck me, fuck me hard. Make me come. Make me feel a real, big fat cock fucking me so good, making me come. Make my pussy feel your hard cock, baby. Yeah, I'm fucking ready."</p> <p>"Oh, wow, Caitlyn, I don't know if we'll ever get to do that," I gasped, "You are such a good lover. It really makes me feel like a woman again."</p> <p>"I know what you mean, buddy. I'm all for making love to you, if it's the right way."</p> <p>She put the pill on the nightstand next to my bed and walked over and helped me climb in the bed. She pushed my arms up, onto the pillow next to my head, and straddled my head. She put her knees to my chest, her skirt hiked up around her waist, her panties covering her and holding the sides of my face in place on the bed behind my head.</p> <p>She lowered her head to my cock, her warm breath making it throb and swell inside her mouth as she began licking the inside of my dick. Her tongue danced like a butterfly's wings around the head of my dick, drawing the last trace of cum from it to drip slowly down my shaft to the very tip.</p> <p>Her body began moving up and down in front of my face, over my lips, my nose, but she didn't touch me yet. She took my hand in hers and held it in front of me. I could see she used the fingers of my other hand to push herself up on me. I knew exactly what she wanted. We were making love to each other.</p> <p>She was so beautiful, lying there next to me looking so sweet. I could do anything to her. I was going to take her into my arms and lay her down beside me and start with her. I wanted to taste her so badly. I wanted to taste it all. I wanted to give pleasure to her like only another woman has ever given pleasure to her.</p> <p>She turned her body to face me again and smiled as she leaned down for me. I began to lick at her tits. I wanted to take her nipples into my mouth and suck on them while my tongue played the tip across hers. Caitlyn's body was so beautiful, and every bit of her drove me wild.</p> <p>I began licking at the base of each tit, paying special attention to the rosebud between her thighs. She began rubbing her pelvis down on mine while I sucked on each nipple. My hands were holding on to her ass cheeks, pulling her up toward me as she pushed her breasts all the harder into my mouth. Each lick she did to me made her shudder and her pussy squeeze down on me.</p> <p>I wanted so much to take her there and then. I wanted to feel her come all over me while my cock continued to throb and swell inside her. I wanted her to feel like a woman. I wanted to kiss her face and make love to her mouth.</p> <p>I let my tongue play all over her, starting on her forehead, making it wet with her sweat. I traced down to her lips and back up, teasing her before continuing on to kiss her. I could see how turned on she was, her body writhing her head from side to side and pushing her big tits up against my body.</p> <p>"Kiss me, lover. Kiss me and make love to me."</p> <p>I did. She kissed me, and I kissed her again. She kissed me back, pushing her tongue between mine to entice me. I kissed her back as she pulled her mouth away from mine and began kissing backâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
