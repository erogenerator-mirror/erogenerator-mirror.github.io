Okay! Do you have something to eat?"</p> <p>"I'm not hungry at all." I shook my head in disbelief. "And you know it's just as well not, because I want, if I can say it, to have sex with you," I offered. "Okay, but only one person," she said softly. "I might as well do it myself. And I don't want to rush into anything. I am on my way home tomorrow morning so we'll just have to talk and be patient."</p> <p>My cock was getting hard just thinking about her. I wanted her so badly I would do anything to have her. This was the best thing. And she's my wife so there was no reason to worry. However, I had to talk with the other guy to see if we could start slow. I knew it could be a little tricky, but it wasn't really a problem. She was my wife, and I would just have to wait until that evening. I'd give her what must have been a mind-blowing orgasm if she couldn't wait to experience it.</p> <p>"Okay, honey," I said. "If that's okay. But you have to tell me about this first." I grabbed the food while we went through the buffet line.</p> <p>"Are you sure? I'll just... uh..."</p> <p>"I said if what we talk about is okay between us, it would only be fair to have sex with your husband."</p> <p>She shook her head sadly. "This is crazy but... I've had sex with two guys, in less than one week," she said.</p> <p>"Oh, yes. And they weren't your first," I said. "We went through some very similar experiences with my first guys."</p> <p>"I'm so sorry I said that!" she exclaimed. "I've never had sex with that much. I love you so much!"</p> <p>Of course I immediately regretted saying that. The first time she made herself vulnerable to my love. No matter how intense it was, it was still a little weird, but it had been that way. It was the first time since we were married anyway. It was always just sex. But now it was her first time, and she wanted to. "Okay. I'll tell you about it if you want me to."</p> <p>"No, not yet. I want to talk to you too," I told her.</p> <p>"I don't know how. We were just talking about something that's going to involve things in our marriage," I told her.</p> <p>"We?"</p> <p>"Well... I was thinking, maybe we could talk about that sometime," I said. "If you're ready."</p> <p>"Of course I am!" She grinned wickedly. "I was also thinking I should call him right now." She leaned against me and hugged me.</p> <p>My heart was beating wildly. It was racing and I could feel it throbbing. I was sure we would have to just do it by hand. She was right, of course. I could only hope that once we got over the shock it would somehow make a difference. If it did not, it would be just a matter of time. And so I told her about a friend of mine that was having sex with my wife.</p> <p>When it was a surprise to hear from me, she seemed to be on cloud nine. That was one of the things that made her so sexy! This was as much of a surprise as one to say. For me to hear from her about it turned out to be a great deal of relief. After all, it was not hard for the poor unsuspecting wife to talk about the events of the last few days with my best friend. But I had to keep it from affecting our relationship even further. The problem didn't go away, but it brought all three of us back together like crazy.</p> <p>Just as things got back to normal, we made sure everything was in place before it got to that point. Although I still could only imagine what was left behind, it would have to wait. We had been back together for days and we had only done it once. That was just a prelude of how things were being going between us the next day. I hoped that I could keep up this charade.</p> <p>"I will," she said. "As much as I want to, I need a drink!" She made her way back upstairs to prepare the bar. And sure enough, our friends were just down the hall from me. If only I had the courage.</p> <p>When he came out of the bathroom in his boxers and shirt, he stood in the doorway wearing only the boxer shorts. "Hey, man! Can you pour me a glass of wine first?" I joked. When she came back down the hall, he handed me a glass and took a sip.
