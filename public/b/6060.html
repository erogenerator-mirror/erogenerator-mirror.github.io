I asked.</p> <p>"Hell, yeah," I said.</p> <p>She pulled me down onto her and we kissed again. Then, she started pulling at my zipper.</p> <p>"Wait a second," I said.</p> <p>And she did, opening my pants and dropping them and I stepped out of them and then the briefs and I pulled her to me and I kissed her again and I felt my erection rising out of the fly of my pants.</p> <p>I unshifted my position and knelt in front of her and started unstrapping her feet. I didn't have time for this right away.</p> <p>She grabbed my hair and pulled me back down on top of her. My erection was still pressing against her and I slipped a thigh between hers and started sliding my shaft up and down her thigh. She held me tightly until I was almost to the end of her thigh and then she started pulling me back down.</p> <p>"I want your big hard dick," she said.</p> <p>I felt her hand grab the top of my erection and start stroking my shaft. As she stroked me, I felt the head of my cock press up against her pussy lips, pushing past them.</p> <p>"Oh my God!" I squealed.</p> <p>I felt her hand slip back to my cock and she started to stroke me while she kissed her.</p> <p>"Are you going to cum again?" she asked me.</p> <p>"Yeah!" I moaned. "Oh God, baby, I'm gonna cum!"</p> <p>With that, she pushed down hard and I felt her pussy open and envelope my penis. I felt like I was being split apart.</p> <p>"Cum in me, David!" she yelled.</p> <p>I did exactly that and a wave of pleasure washed over me and my body spasmed as it tried to hold on to her.</p> <p>"Oh, fuck!" I growled as she pulled up on my cock.</p> <p>She held me tight as the waves of pleasure washed over me and the wave subsided.</p> <p>"Oh, God!" I gasped.</p> <p>When I had recovered, with my back against the shower wall, she lay on top of me and held me as the pleasure subsided. With just her lips on mine, I could tell she was crying.</p> <p>"I love you," she sighed.</p> <p>"I love you, too," I replied.</p> <p>She stroked me for several minutes as she caught her breath then she got up and put her arm around my shoulders. I could feel her rubbing something against the inside of my thigh and something was pressing against herself there.</p> <p>I turned my head and kissed her. "Can we try something different?"</p> <p>"Maybe," she said. "Like with you?"</p> <p>"Maybe," I said.</p> <p>"Maybe?"</p> <p>"Oh, I think we might think differently.</p> <p>"Maybe? Maybe!"</p> <p>"Just remember, you said we could try something different," I said, "I already did that."</p> <p>She looked at me funny and I smiled.</p> <p>"But?"</p> <p>"I'm with you on the airplane."</p> <p>"Then let's go get our things."</p> <p>"Oh, my God!"</p> <p>She smiled then she got dressed. I went home as she walked me through the kitchen, the shower went on, then I did some cleaning for her.</p> <p>On the way back she caught me staring but she said nothing. When I got home, I told her I was still confused and she said that she was confused as well. I was wondering how to say something so I got a beer and went to my room to think.</p> <p>I was thinking that it was possible we could go back to before we could do anything with it since I had felt a lot of guilt about having her and feeling guilty about it. Now I was wondering if there was a way to go back again.</p> <p>I felt like I had been prying into someone's innermost secrets but I also knew I had lost her because she still hadn't told me why they had been taken. When I went to my room, I sat and took a nap. When I woke, it was dark and I went to my bunk to sit. I looked around my room briefly because I thought of what I had left when I had left. There were some things in my closet and a few books but I decided I'd just sit there and read until I went to sleep.</p> <p>After the next week, I found a way to talk her into going to some girl's night club and I invited her to come along.
