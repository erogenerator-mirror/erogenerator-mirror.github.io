I really, really love you." I kissed her lips one more time and stepped back. With a smile, she turned away from my view and disappeared into the house, not looking back. The first thing I saw was her head in her arms, her back arching for me as she kissed my cheek, just barely touching.</p> <p>She turned and looked at me, grinning, then looked me in the eye and, as a tear dropped from her cheek, a sly smile crossed her face. "Mom," she said, her voice low and seductive, "I'll see you later." Without looking back, she turned and walked back to the bedroom. That night, I couldn't go off like that. I couldn't think of anything else at all that might help me. I think my face showed it to that. I'll never forget the look in her eyes that afternoon. I love you too, she added, then disappeared.</p> <p>*******</p> <p>I went in to the living room with my laptop and put it away after I hit the web. My laptop was still sitting on the coffee table. I found the keys for it and hit the open button on one of the monitors. I'd never really liked the computer, but for some reason the fact that it was an entertainment system got the job done. I was excited that it was finally a feature I could use, but just as excited that I could actually go online with it. I was pleased, though, with how much I was getting my mother out of the house the way I wanted it. The more I did it, however, the more I became aware that I was using the control thing in a lot more than it was used on the screen.</p> <p>"What's up with you?" I asked, not wanting to ruin the mood.</p> <p>"Nothing mom," I replied, but I also wasn't really sure that I wanted to say anything else. How could I, you see! This thing has to do with us. But I wasn't looking for anything out of the ordinary. In fact, I was glad I hadn't done anything in particular that would make my mom uncomfortable.</p> <p>I began to wonder just how far I could push this thing as far as I wanted it to go, but as I lay back on the couch and played the laptop over the sound system on the phone, I could see it starting to make sense again. It would have to do with us. It was all I thought about for the rest of the night, but eventually drifted to sleep, with no visions of today's events to get my mind off of the fact that mom knew about it.</p> <p>My dreams were filled with images of mom. It was the first time I had had a real-life lover in months. Our lovemaking was slow and gentle, but it felt as if my very being was being satisfied. As often as we did that thing, mom would come and watch a little while, but mostly it was just about her. Her presence brought back the days when she'd watch while I played with toys in bed. Every time, sometimes I'd get her to come over and sit on my face for a while. She'd often bring a toy or two with her because it felt as if she was there, just holding it in place. She could watch for the rest of the time, all the time, if she wanted to. She liked her toys and I really liked playing with them. I'd play with my cock a bit before I got myself off, sometimes a little on the edge, then off again, sometimes on the edge. I liked my Mom's toys quite a bit too, and I'd often come on my face like so. I'd make her come for me. I would try to think of it as being the only way to be with her, if she liked a different man, but mostly she'd always tell me I was the only one who could pleasure her the way I wanted her to. It was a good thing she did it as a teen. I did. I'd never have thought I'd be doing it as a mother. I knew that sometimes I was doing it myself. This was really getting to me.</p> <p>*******</p> <p>It didn't take much for me to realize the feeling of being on the edge of orgasm. Mom was already in the middle of it. I pulled the control from the laptop at my desk and went back to it. I tried to get it under control though, but then it got really big. One minute I was still hard as a rock, but when I could get the idea of her and me going at it again, I really wanted it to go as hard as possible. I had to see a video. I sat and waited until I had a recording from mom.</p> <p>I'm not sure what I was expecting, but it justâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
