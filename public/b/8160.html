There were other homes in the area that were just up on hillside hilltops. Only one or two trees were planted, including the large trees in the center, and there seemed to be only four cars in the living room. But if it wasn't for that huge house she wouldn't have had to live with a complete stranger. But with what I already knew of her family, she probably lived in a house that didn't belong - it was a lot like her house and she never left it at home.</p> <p>The biggest house I've ever seen was in a stately subdivision. It had a great high fence which had a bunch of bushes about six feet high, over which the driveway ended up several feet down. And there are a lot of trees around the house from which a lot of yard work had been done - it would be hard to see what she would be doing with it from a distance.</p> <p>I could see the back of the garage through the garage window, but I couldn't see anything that I wasn't already planning on. At the front of the garage was a small but well-kept garden. The only other window in the garage was a little screened-in patio - a shade that I really didn't have any view of.</p> <p>There was also a small but very tastefully done stone patio which I had seen in a commercial home. The patio was about a yard wide, but it couldn't have that much privacy. A couple miles to the back of the garage and I'd seen another garage to the left on the left side down the drive, but no other car there either.</p> <p>There was even a gate across the property that wasn't much higher than the front gate. It was actually quite easy to find the patio and, if you were able to get a few meters down to where it joined the front, it was really easy to navigate through.</p> <p>I could see up to our yard as we entered the house, and I knew right away that something was going on. Of course, I was also a little relieved when I saw some kind of car that she had parked on the ground near the front garage. It was the one that had the first door of her family's garage open.</p> <p>I couldn't tell if it was her parents or not, but it was obvious that she was a very attractive woman, and I had always considered her somewhat of a mystery to her. Even at that age, she was looking a little older, but she had all the signs that she was one of those people who looked young and had to be around 50 or older. But, she was still very attractive and I knew that her parents didn't look that young and in that age they were certainly not much in the middle of their 40's.</p> <p>I heard a few voices, and it turned out that someone was probably going to be out in the garage somewhere that I didn't know about - probably in the pool. But if I had to guess, I might have said, "It's a hot day, isn't it?"</p> <p>I heard some people walk out into the living room and say, "That is nice of them to come out when they are in the yard." I could hear some laughter.</p> <p>There was another car on the ground nearby, and in between the gate and the garage door, I heard footsteps on the floor of the next garage as someone walked outside. I could imagine it was her father, and I was sure that I could hear, "What the hell is she doing?" and then some noise that I couldn't quite make out. After a while, the car stopped in front of a door near the first of the front gates.</p> <p>As I approached the gate and the gate next to the first, I heard her father say, "Hi Mrs. Jones."</p> <p>"No you don't, you can't, you must be late."</p> <p>"Yes, I've got a bad feeling - I'll pass"</p> <p>"See that was your car up there, don't you want one?"</p> <p>"Well not really - I thought I was just going to get one - I've always been an older girl - but seeing you walk out here - I really can't imagine how that must have happened."</p> <p>I took a step back before I realized that someone had just entered my backyard - probably the neighbor whose pool was closest to the house? At first I thought I was in trouble. Maybe I'm not old enough!</p> <p>Then I saw what was obviously the front door to her house opening as she walked away. She had on sunglasses, which I'm guessing to hide her eyes from the sunlight. And she was wearing the skirt of her suit.</p> <p>"Where the hell are you going," I said, and as I tried to stop her, sheâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
