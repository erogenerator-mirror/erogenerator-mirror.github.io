The next car was next and then the first car to the right. He couldn't tell if the third car or any other of the cars did. He was almost ready to cry but didn't. He was in too much pain to do so.</p> <p>As it happened, the third car pulled into the drive next to the first and the boy saw an old looking Chevy truck. He saw the driver's door open and she was naked and running toward him. She ran hard and fast but did not get very far. She kept going and ran into the back of the Chevy and jumped out. He was not sure if anything else happened that day but it sure sounded crazy.</p> <p>She ran back into the house and then in through a door and up the stairs to the third floor. She was naked but looked like a girl in a barber shop. The man who picked her up was the owner of the house and he was very cute. He was also naked as well.</p> <p>"You bastard," she said as she reached out of the kitchen. "Didn't you notice? I am a married woman."</p> <p>"Oh yes, Ma'am." the man said with a laugh. "I told you. You were out there doing that when you were in high school. I was surprised that your ass would stay out there at all. I like that. You aren't my girlfriend and I don't care if you are. Is that better?"</p> <p>"No, really. It is just something I have to do in college or my job or something. I'm just here to help you out of your problems."</p> <p>"I'm not the one doing all the work, you little fucker. You have a responsibility here and I am here."</p> <p>She ran into the living room and got back to her feet and began to leave. In the light that came through the window, she could see the man walking toward her. She turned and saw him standing a few steps behind her. She tried to stop him but he said, "Get the fuck out first. I know you are my friend so I know that you aren't a complete slut but I wanted a chance to be friendly."</p> <p>He grabbed her again but this time she grabbed his forearm and twisted hard. The little man fell hard into the room. He landed at her feet and she kicked it out of his hand.</p> <p>"That's a right fucking bitch," she sneered at the man. "Get your fucking hands off of her and give her that ass." She swung with her left arm in a vicious circle but hit him in the middle and dropped him to the floor with a thud. "Don't worry about the bitch I thought you were a nice young man. Give her your ass. Get it as bad as you fucking care about. Now get it over with and give it to me."</p> <p>The man was crying. His body language and actions showed no sign of getting any kind of reaction. He staggered, almost tripped and then began to slump to the floor. He looked at her and then up to the window and then back down. He then looked up to the house and saw it in a different light. There were four people in the yard watching the action going on up and down. He tried to move but his body was useless. He tried to stand but his head couldn't lift the roof of the house so he fell back onto the bed.</p> <p>The woman who had been standing with him stopped and stared at the man. She was staring right at the window trying to see what was going on out there. The woman walked back into the room. She grabbed the man and threw him back on the bed. She threw the man's clothes out of the window. She then threw the man's shirt and underwear out right next to the window.</p> <p>"Get those things away from my eyes," she said as she kicked the man's feet. He fell back onto the bed and the woman stood up. "Get your fucking hands off of her and get the fuck away from my fucking eyes."</p> <p>As he fell back into the room, the woman moved to her bag and began to rummage through it. Then she started to put some clothes back on and walked out of the room. She was carrying several other clothes to use in the spare bedroom.</p> <p>When she returned she handed him a dress. He looked at the number of times he was going to walk out into the yard and say he was going home without even wearing any clothes. When he was gone, she put her clothes on the pile in the closet. Then she walked out to the back yard and left the house.</p> <p>It wasn't long before they had gotten back and were sitting around watching TV. The woman said to her that she knew she was just a friend and that she shouldn't be doing it. She didn'tâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
