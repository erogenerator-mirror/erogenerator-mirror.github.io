They stood and stared at each other in disbelief at his love.</p> <p>For a moment she couldn't seem to bring herself to speak. She had always loved him and he loved her. But, in that instant, with no commitment, no commitment, and with the feeling of his love for her at the back of his brain, it was suddenly not his wife he loved!</p> <p>"Gina, I want you to marry me" he said, his eyes so full of love his lips so sweet "and I want to marry you, Gina. And, when we get married, we will make love! And, if we are happy together, we will begin making babies!"</p> <p>He was talking so fast his face did not meet hers. She was so confused and yet so entranced by it all. He was a man of great weight to her and she wanted to be his, and she wanted him to continue love her every last step of the way until they got married.</p> <p>He stood there for a moment, looking at her and then he leaned in and kissed her. With her mouth opened to him, he looked into her eyes for a moment. He brought her lips on to his and this time she did respond. She closed her mouth, her arms went around his neck, she held to him, kissed him, and kissed him deep!</p> <p>He pulled the front of her dress apart and then slid two fingers through her, in and out of her, while he brought her right to the edge of orgasm, then backed off, making her want him more.</p> <p>He kissed the corners of her mouth, her cheek, and finally he pulled her dress off and it was down the hall to the bedroom. They went in, he took a condom from the nightstand and opened it.</p> <p>She looked at him with shock, but he took the condom and threw it in the trash. He then climbed in the bed, they lay there and he kissed her, his tongue moving all over her mouth. Then, he brought his hand up to fondle her breasts. He ran his hand over her nipples, squeezing them, making them hard and erect under his loving lips. She was moaning and her voice was thick with erotic desire.</p> <p>He moved down to kiss and suck her breasts and suck on her nipples, he would leave them standing there in his mouth as he kissed and sucked them, and she tasted her own taste in his mouth. Her hands were touching his face and running through his hair as his lips moved over the other breast.</p> <p>He put one leg between hers, his balls pressing there as he lowered his mouth, running his rough tongue over her hard little nipple. He started circling her nipple with his tongue as she had done to him many years ago. Slowly and carefully he circled her right breast with his tongue, her breathing became deeper. He continued sucking and licking and soon had her nipple hard under his tongue. Now he was licking her like she had done to him. She felt his tongue rubbing all over her nipple with his moist tongue, then his lips closed on it and he sucked it hard while his hand slid down to her crotch, cupping her vagina. But when she felt it on his finger she started pulling it down, to her clit and to him!</p> <p>"Oh yes! That feels good! Please don't stop!" she cried as he sucked her nipple until she was groaning.</p> <p>He then kissed his way down her stomach and moved back over her. She raised her hips when his tongue met her wet swollen clitoris and she started thrusting against his mouth. He put one of his long thick fingers inside her and then used his thumb to rub her clitoris as he licked her from below.</p> <p>She cried her first release and as she held the back of his head against her she climaxed with a soft moan and pushed his head back into her wetness as she came! He kept licking her as she convulsed, he moved around her and when she was once again back where she had been in the 69 position he climbed over her and inserted himself into her.</p> <p>He fucked her hard and felt himself grow inside her as he felt the warm wet wetness of her. Her hips started to rise up to meet his thrusts and when she moaned with the first sign of her own climax and she felt his penis thicken deep inside her he pulled out of her and moved over to her mouth.</p> <p>"Swallow it, darling! I want you to suck all that juice from my dick! Please."</p> <p>He pulled his mouth and tongue from hers so she could catch a breath. She looked at him, and with his cock still wet with them they moved to the bed.</p> <p>He laid down, taking her head in his hands.
