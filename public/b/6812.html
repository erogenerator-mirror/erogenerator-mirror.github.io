"I'll go put things down and then bring this food to you. You need to eat, you want to stop thinking," he continued, with a smile. I didn't get it. I was more hungry than I thought.</p> <p>"I'm going," I said, smiling a little.</p> <p>"Where?" he asked as he walked back to his cart. When he turned back, I smiled. I was so hungry at that point.</p> <p>I got up on the bed and lay flat, my legs splayed as far apart as I could. It seemed I was never going to be able to lie still with a hungry man around. He sat on the bed next to his cart and leaned towards me, kissing me lightly on the lips. "Eat first," he said. "I want to see you eat." I smiled back and nibbled my lip. He smiled. "Come on," he said as I felt his tongue run over my lips, licking at those as he pulled back to look at me.</p> <p>We walked to the main room and when we crossed the threshold, my eyes went wide. Two of the finest cooks in the world were on the balcony, just a few feet away. I turned back to him and I reached for him. When he broke up the kiss, he pulled me up and off the bed, leaving me to take in the sights around us. When he saw the two men on the balcony, he smiled and took them into his arms. His lips met mine, his tongue slipping into my mouth. His arms wrapped around me and pulled me closer as his hands moved down my back to grab hold of my naked ass. The hand that had been exploring my ass moved up to grip my breast, pinching a nipple and squeezing it gently. He took this nipple into his hands and started to massage it. I didn't need it, I moaned when he squeezed harder and pinched more roughly. My legs went weak as I came up against him.</p> <p>He grabbed both my wrists and pulled my arms back over my head. I felt his tongue move over my lips as he kissed me from cheek to cheek. The kiss deepened. Our desire was so intense. He broke the kiss, looking at me. "I hope you like me, baby," he said to me, moving down to wrap his lips around my nipple. Taking the tip, he sucked hard and my head jerked back. He smiled. "I wanted to do that to you so bad, and now I have..."he stopped as soon as he got to my nipple. "Please," he gasped as he ran his tongue over the sensitive nub. When he sucked on it, his tongue slithered deep into my belly. "Yes," I cried as I felt him roll my nipple between his finger and thumb. I grabbed hold of the dresser and pushed harder against his mouth as he sucked on my nipple as if I would suck his cock.</p> <p>He kept sucking, but did much more than that. He licked and flicked his way across my breasts, stopping every so often to blow on my left nipple.</p> <p>"You like that baby," he murmered, his breath sending a shiver up and down my body. "You like having your nipple sucked on, baby? You like having a man suck on yours...oh god...right there." As I moaned, he continued playing with it. The sensations, the heat, the control. The only thing that existed were two people who shared a common need that were as primal as my own feelings. He knew this and his actions made me feel things that were beyond me.</p> <p>He released my nipples long enough to let my dress drop to the floor and to pull off his shirt. His fingers had returned to massaging my nipple and I couldn't take it anymore. I wanted him naked, I would take him as fast as I could walk into the bathroom and throw him on the bed and fuck him senseless until I was spent. I had never felt such hunger in all my life. I had no idea how far I had gone with him, but I felt it growing within me and as he slid down my body, his lips coming down over my nipple, he lowered his lips towards my mound.</p> <p>My body was on fire. I felt the wetness of his mouth as his tongue snaked out from all around his lips to taste. He was sucking my nipple as if it was my entire body, taking in every inch; and I couldn't deny he knew it. He didn't do anything except suck and to lick all around, taking it up his body and his hands, taking them as he pulled them down over my hips and around my waist to pull the material of my skirt down and off, exposing my body completely.
