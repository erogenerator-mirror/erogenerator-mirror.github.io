She felt like floating on a cloud of liquid heat. Her cunt started to quiver and her whole body was jelloing. Her whole body was shaking as she started to cum.</p> <p>Gee, that was so hot!</p> <p>When she was done, I felt her thighs clamp down on mine and her cunt quivering again. It seemed like she was just draining out the cum. I couldn't believe we were doing it.</p> <p>Now, we were all in one big heap on the bed. We were all still in this high state of awareness.</p> <p>As if in a seizure, all the energy drained from our bodies in one go. I was still gasping for breath and I finally collapsed in a sweat-covered heap on top of her.</p> <p>As I laid there, I finally thought about how wild I had been and how much I hadn't cum.</p> <p>I felt so totally satisfied. I hadn't even noticed that I got hard when I came, but my cock was still rock hard.</p> <p>I looked at Linda as if that moment had never happened. It seemed so unbelievable, but so exciting. I couldn't help myself from feeling more and more turned on by her as she lay there in a semi-conscious state.</p> <p>"I think I'm going to have a shower now. Thanks for the great job, I think."</p> <p>She seemed to suddenly drift off into a dream. I was beginning to have second thoughts about what was going to happen. As I watched her, she rolled over in a semi-conscious state and closed her eyes as she drifted back to a dreamy state.</p> <p>She was on her back lying on her side and her arm was around herself. Her hand was caressing her right breast as she gently rubbed her nipple.</p> <p>She closed her eyes again as she slowly took a couple of slow deep breaths.</p> <p>"That was wonderful last night," she said softly, as if she was listening to what I was thinking.</p> <p>To my surprise, my cock seemed to stir again. I couldn't believe I was actually enjoying watching what my beautiful wife was doing to herself.</p> <p>I didn't say anything and, just continued watching.</p> <p>She opened her eyes and looked at me. She saw where my eyes were watching and she smiled.</p> <p>"You know, I think that was the best night of my life. Thank you, thank you for giving me an experience I never had in my life." She said while leaning her head on my shoulder. She was still softly caressing her breast.</p> <p>"Can I have another glass of wine or a beer? I'll go change."</p> <p>"I'd like to come back to bed," I said.</p> <p>"Oh," she said, "I think there was some mistake that I made last night. I think I'll come back again, I'm in a state of arousal."</p> <p>"No, I really don't want to see you this way again. I think it's time that we left. I'll go take a quick shower, if I can." So I got up and looked around.</p> <p>I decided that I would take the bottle of wine, and headed back to the master bed. As I walked, I could see through the crack of the door. Both of the bed's head cover was open. We all looked toward the door. Gee, did we both just see our naked spouses?</p> <p>I walked out to the open door. We stood in the doorway looking at the water streaming across the hot sun. We both were breathing hard and our faces were flushed from the excitement of the moment. Gee, when ever I'd ever seen you like that and you were naked, I'd never seen you like that.</p> <p>My hands were trembling. I was trying not to make a noise. It sounded good to me but I wanted to make sure I didn't ruin my good mood. I really was glad to have enjoyed myself this second night in my life. I looked over at her. She had her eyes closed and it occurred to me that, if I were sitting there, she might have heard me.</p> <p>I couldn't believe what I was hearing. It sounded so good! She hadn't even noticed that my cock was hard.</p> <p>I had never seen another woman have this kind of intense sexual feelings and it was a turn-on.</p> <p>My cock was as hard as it could get, pointing straight up in the air. I was thinking to myself, "How do I feel? What about your husband? I mean, what happens at home?"</p> <p>I had that image of me doing things with Bill. I think that when I got home from the gym, I had a huge stiff cock.</p> <p>This morning, I wondered if Bill would ever feelâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
