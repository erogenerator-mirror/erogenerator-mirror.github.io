My name is Kavita, my mother is Kavita."</p> <p>"What is your birth name, dear?"</p> <p>"Viviana. Kavita. I can't tell you my birth name. Please!"</p> <p>"Oh, dear." I had to smile. That was a wonderful girl. She knew everything I needed from me and I felt that I could take care of her as often as I wanted her without taking her life on my shoulders.</p> <p>"I'm Kavita bye." She beamed and I bowed to her before she reached for my hand tightly, kissing the top of my hand after hers was done.</p> <p>"See? No pressure from me!"</p> <p>"You are my hero. I must say, you are pretty, sweetheart."</p> <p>"Thank you."</p> <p>"Now about that shower I said it wouldn't be long..." Kavita's eyes had lit up in wonder.</p> <p>"Oh no..."</p> <p>"And just what would I have done if you had said no? And it's not a shower," she teased.</p> <p>"No!" She laughed</p> <p>"Oh, I see," she chuckled, "a shower is always so nice..."</p> <p>"So you are okay with me being naked? What did I do wrong? I'm such a fool."</p> <p>"Don't be such a fool," she said and I thought it made her laugh. I'm not going to let this mess get that far.</p> <p>"Well, okay, but you better be clean."</p> <p>She got up in my arms and started to dance for me, not really dancing anymore, just dancing away from me and trying to keep me close to finish what she had started in her bedroom. I couldn't take my eyes off her. She was so beautiful, so sexy, and she made me feel that she could do anything and I could do nothing at all.</p> <p>Our dancing continued during the next song and then Kavita stopped. She had to put her arms around me to keep me from touching her as she said, "This is my shower." I looked at her questioningly. She held her arms out, "Take your shower, sweetie."</p> <p>I took my hand and got out of the bed first and then started my shower. It was a warm water shower, not a steam shower, not a sponge shower, but it still felt nice. My hair was getting damp and I was getting hard. I got out of the bed and she came around to my side and wrapped me in her warm arms and pulled my body tight against hers. She smelled so good.</p> <p>"I love you, Kavita," I said in her ear and I don't think I've ever been able to express it in words. I had said the same thing in the locker room.</p> <p>"I know. I know."</p> <p>"Kavita, I don't know. That was so fucking awesome. I mean it's the hottest thing I've ever heard. If I had my heart in my chest any harder, I'd be dead, or whatever happened."</p> <p>"There's nothing wrong with telling me in private," she said. I kissed her, "I'm sure I could go further."</p> <p>"Oh, honey. I want you. I'm not in that mood to leave this place yet."</p> <p>"Okay," she took my hand and started pulling me toward her and said, "Let's go." She got up from the bed and let me get my shower again. I went through the curtain and had a quick look at her room, but she was gone. I turned on the shower again and then turned to the bathroom to put on some clothes. I was really excited. This was really crazy. I'd never done anything in the last couple of years with a girl of my sexual experience, and now that my mom knew it was okay, it started to be even more crazy than before.</p> <p>"You're just like a fucking kid," I said to myself as I stripped and got in the shower.</p> <p>"I can't. Mom's coming over in two hours. She needs to know you are naked and this is a one time only shower... that's it."</p> <p>I finished my shower and grabbed my clothes and went to my room. It was a little over an hour and I made love to my girlfriend. I made her wait all night for the time frame. The last time we got into a fight had been about 45 minutes earlier when my mom tried to give me a lecture about my not having enough time to make it to her. I had had enough time to think about the last thing she should be telling me and I had just fallen head over heels in love with her when she said, "If you're going to have to fuck to get it, come to meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
