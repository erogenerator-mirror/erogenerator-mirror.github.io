"Make me cum, baby. Make me cum. Make me cum with your big cock."</p> <p>She was moaning loud and shaking and I held deep inside her, making her feel good. She let out a big sigh and I started to move my hips, working myself into her harder and faster, while she screamed, "Make me cum, baby! Make my pussy cum. You make me so fucking hot." She grabbed my cock and started to stroke it. She was looking at me with her big green eyes. "Do it baby, do it now!"</p> <p>I pushed forward a little while and started to pump my cum deep into her pussy. I was fucking her. Feeling her hot wetness envelop my cock inside her. After about a minute I started to relax, and slipped out.</p> <p>"Fuck me again," she said. "Again!"</p> <p>I slipped in and out, making her feel good again. I felt the cum start to burn out of her again and I started fucking her again, while she was lying on the bed. It was making me so horny. I could feel the cum drying out of her pussy.</p> <p>"Your cock feels so good inside me," she said. "I love your big cock in my pussy!" She was rubbing it back and forth with her hand. "Make me cuummmmmmm."</p> <p>She got up so her head was towards me and I could smell her after we kissed.</p> <p>"Cum inside me again, please. I want it so bad," she cried. "Cum inside me again!"</p> <p>I did, and let go a huge gusher of cum inside her, feeling myself throb. After we stopped kissing she lay there on the bed. We still had our clothes on, but the light in the bedroom was off.</p> <p>"Are you OK with what happened? I know you have your cock in me, if we're going to do it again. We haven't had sex in months."</p> <p>That made me feel good.</p> <p>"It's too bad you're here, baby," she said. "I'm on a plane tomorrow and I really need you inside me. I'm all dirty and dirty and I really want you to fuck me again."</p> <p>She said that, and I was surprised. I said it.</p> <p>"I'm so sorry. I don't know what I ever want to do to you."</p> <p>She smiled at that.</p> <p>"I've known you in a very long time, and don't you ever forget it. You're the reason I got off the plane."</p> <p>I asked her, if I could do it. She said, yes. I wanted to make love to her again, so we could start to look at the future. My future. I'd wait till I was ready.</p> <p>"Good night, baby," she said as she lay next to me, kissing my cheek.</p> <p>...</p> <p>I got off the plane, went to meet Melissa and her girlfriend, a girl that I knew, who I would see every day after the next one started. We met on the plane, and were about to take off for our honeymoon at her hotel.</p> <p>"Hey, Melissa," she said. "Do you know someone?</p> <p>"Yeah I do. Let me introduce you to your new roomie."</p> <p>I was feeling a little weird. This woman is too young to have me fuck her, but she's pretty cute. I was hoping she would be my girlfriend, but there was a reason why I was with her. Melissa was about to tell me about her ex who had been in her twenties, and that she did the same to me. I didn't remember how long that it took me to think I might have known her. It made me feel a little better to know that Melissa was there for me while I was with her. "Hello! Hi, I'm Dan, your new roomie," she said, kissing me on the cheek. Then she kissed me on the lips. Her lips were warm and soft. She was so sweet. We kissed, and then got into my room. "How was your weekend?" she asked, holding my arms.</p> <p>"Great. Your boyfriend was so nice. I could feel him looking at everything."</p> <p>"You are so sweet, Dan." She pulled me and hugged my hand, making me feel small again.</p> <p>"We will take it slowly, Dan, you are going to enjoy it. When we get to the hotel, you and my mom go to the suite; we'll get cleaned up a bit before we go to sleep this time."</p> <p>"Sounds good to me," I said. She laughed. "You are so funny! You know I'm not going to put up with that kind of talk."</p> <p>"Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
