He continued to work his face into her pussy.</p> <p>'Ooo, you're doing ok.' She grinned again as he moved in, now using his mouth to flick the tip of her clit with the tip of his tongue. His pace was picking up. Just when a wave of pure ecstasy was building for her, he put a finger in her pussy slowly, teasing her ass, then slipped a finger back in slowly, then put a second finger in. Soon both of them were furiously stroking the insides of their pussies as they ground themselves into each other.</p> <p>'Oh god,' She gasped, 'fuck that...make me cum.' He kept pounding her pussy, fingers buried inside, and she exploded over and over again like a firework. Her clit became harder and harder with each wave of ecstasy that hit her. Her whole body was on fire.</p> <p>'Hmmm, yes....' She moaned.</p> <p>'I want more,' He whispered behind her, still kneeling on the ground. 'Let's see your pussy squirt.'</p> <p>She felt something at the base of her spine, which she knew was his cock. She was being guided toward the base. "Are you sure?' He asked her, not quite sure what she was feeling as he stood up. She smiled and nodded slowly. 'Now,' he said as he gently bent her backwards, pushing her backwards onto his shaft.</p> <p>Her muscles instantly tightened as she sank down on his shaft. 'I can do this any time.' The feeling was intense. 'You're so tight.'</p> <p>'It's wonderful, doesn't it,' he said, slowly lifting up and pushing it in slowly. 'Yes, yes, yes,' she chanted as he was filling her completely. 'I love your beautiful cock - so deep!' She couldn't help crying out.</p> <p>'I...gotta tell you...so long, so long...'</p> <p>'I'll be your...whatever...'</p> <p>'...every...time...'</p> <p>'...every...time...'</p> <p>'...every...time...'</p> <p>'...every...time....'</p> <p>'My pussy, my ass'</p> <p>'...every...time...'</p> <p>"I want you to be in me forever," she breathed, still with his cock deep up inside, her pussy still contracting on it and throbbing with her heartbeat.</p> <p>"I want to be inside you forever."</p> <p>"Please don't break me again!"</p> <p>He kissed her on her mouth, softly licking her tongue for a minute before she wrapped her arms and legs around him and pulled him to her, pressing her clit up against him as he started moving his hips in small, quick circles.</p> <p>'Oh gods, yes.'</p> <p>"I didn't feel that...I think I'm...I'm going to explode!'</p> <p>'Keep moving baby!"</p> <p>His body started convulsing as he pushed down into her, the pressure from her arms and legs as they hugged him tight to her until, just before she fell limp with an intense scream, he started filling her completely with his warm semen, his fingers still inside her.</p> <p>She heard his heavy breathing, feeling his pulse in her as he leaned forward, his face just inches from her. He softly kissed her lips and hair.</p> <p>'I can't believe this.'</p> <p>'I did this as many times as I could,' she said laughing gently.
