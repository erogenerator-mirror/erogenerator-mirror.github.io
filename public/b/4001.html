There's definitely more than one more one of these to go in this time."</p> <p>"Hmmmmmmmmm." I could feel him pulling out again and the tip of him pushed against my ass. I gasped at his sudden absence. I looked at the mirror and could see how I looked. Even my face looked good now, I thought.</p> <p>"Now I'm going to push back, I want to make sure it goes in. I'm going to slowly run it in until it's in all the way. And I want to get it into you now."</p> <p>"Please, not yet. My back has tensed up. Please, put that thing in me..." I started to moan and then stopped. I was in a different space with him now than I could before. "I didn't know it could be that big. It's going to take a little more... "I thought he was going to pull it out of me... "I'm being opened up by a big cock... "and I love it."</p> <p>He was still there, in no position to be doing it, but he had me all set up. I was going to enjoy it.</p> <p>And then he slowly pulled it out. Like a gentle hand he held my leg and pushed it back. And then his hands did the same, lifting it back as he went. At first it felt so good, the pressure on my anus felt so good and then there was a pain as the shaft slid back in. The pain was great but then the pain turned to a sensation that I would never have guessed. "Yes. It's gone in. It just went in," I moaned.</p> <p>It felt like he was in all the way, even down to his pubes. He pulled it out again and then back in. "It looks like it's all the way in. I love fucking your ass with my cock."</p> <p>"Yeah, you're all the way in." I moaned. "Go ahead, fuck me, I want to feel it all."</p> <p>He lifted my legs back up and positioned himself between them. I could feel his swollen cockhead probing my opening then entering me again and stretching me until I thought it would rip open. I couldn't believe that this was happening. As he worked in and out of my tight passage I held the pillow underneath my head. I tried to relax, to tell him that he was good. "Just go ahead and get used to it," I said. "It feels good, so good." And as I did so, I felt him press the tip of his cock against me. I wanted to cum. There was no stopping it from happening now. "That feels so good, so good, " I said. And then it happened. The head of his thick cock slipped into me with no resistance at all. There was a pause, I wanted him to continue it. But then my ass was stretched to it's limits. I had never done this before, even with Jim. All the sensations were new, it was a new experience and it excited me as well as me!</p> <p>He pulled half-way out and then slammed his cock back in. I moaned. This was as good as I had ever felt, "Oh, oh god, do it. Do it. Deeper baby, this hurts, it hurts." I said the word, because I wanted to feel it all. He was as deep as I had ever felt.</p> <p>I knew I wanted this feeling to continue and I wanted more. All too soon I felt him getting hard again. I had never had such an intense sensation before. I felt him pull out, and I felt emptiness.</p> <p>"I need to fuck your ass as hard as I can. Just get it over with. I'm close." The words came out like a moan.</p> <p>"God yes!" I cried. And then he was all in, all the way in and the full length of his cock was completely in me.</p> <p>"Is that OK? I asked.</p> <p>"Yes, yes, oh god it feels so good." I felt my ass squeeze him as he began his own slow withdrawal. He moved very slowly into me. When his balls came in contact to my cock and I realized what was happening I cried out, "Yesssss."</p> <p>Then his hands were on my ass. "Oh my. Oh my", I moaned as his cock was slowly moving in and out of me. I felt his big hands on my cheeks as he fucked me, "You're so beautiful. Like beautiful women," he said.</p> <p>"You are beautiful." I said.</p> <p>He started moving in and out, slow at first as he wanted to build in his mind, his body, his strength. But as soon as he moved in and out of me he keptâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
