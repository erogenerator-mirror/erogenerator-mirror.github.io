I wanted nothing more than to show her what a lucky dog she was, that if she wanted, she could play with them, to be able to keep them for her. But as I sat there, my hand going to my breast, my eyes transfixed on her, and it dawned on me she was the only one in the room with me. Her voice, that voice. There were no words to say in response to this new thought. I needed to let go of everything in me to do the right thing but I couldn't. I leaned over and whispered in her ear.</p> <p>"I'll wait here."</p> <p>She looked up at me, her eyes begging me to let her go, the words flowing out of her mouth before she even had a chance to begin. She didn't say anything at all. She just stared at me. I sat, waiting, my heart beating hard in my chest. I sat there for what seemed forever, my skin glistening with sweat. I watched, watching each movement, every hair on her body brush against her legs and down her chest, just as in the dream I'd had so many years ago. I watched her. I watched her in a myriad array of colors in front of me. I thought she was beautiful. I knew everything about her, and I wanted to be the one to tell her that, that I loved her, that I loved her all her life.</p> <p>As for me, I'd forgotten how to live a life completely apart from one partner. I was never sure how I knew then that I was not even in love with anyone that I was with, it was very unlikely. I just knew that I was in love. I was in love with the person I've loved for a long, long time. I couldn't get that feeling out of my mind, couldn't get it even if I had found her. I didn't feel that love for her, that love any more, than I did for my best friend and I would have done anything for her. It was a feeling which took me over.</p> <p>"So, let's go to bed."</p> <p>She reached for my hand. There was a pause before she spoke again, "I can't do that right now, honey."</p> <p>I nodded my head, "What do you want?"</p> <p>"This," she said, and squeezed my hand tightly.</p> <p>There was a brief pause before I let out a sigh, "Okay, then."</p> <p>"Okay," she replied.</p> <p>She pulled away, pulling back the covers and pulling the covers over us. I didn't move, and there was a slight trembling that started deep within me. I took her hand and stood up, stepping out of my jeans as well as mine and I picked up my phone, making sure to set it up at the foot of the bed so we couldn't see it. I handed the phone to my kitten, who smiled and nodded her head in appreciation.</p> <p>"Goodnight, kitten," I answered.</p> <p>"Goodnight, Daddy."</p> <p>As the sleep-slave of your dreams I smiled and turned to leave.</p> <p>The next morning I was the first to wake up. I sat up in bed, brushing out the hair on my body gently, as my eyes adjusted to the light. Slowly, softly the memory of the dream came to me, and I remember my thoughts.</p> <p>I looked at my kitten, who was sleeping. In the dream, her hair was curled, her eyes still closed as if they hadn't really been watching me. The dream changed all of that, and I can't begin to tell you how much I missed it. She was in my mind, moving, singing, and just being, the feeling was indescribable, and it overwhelmed everything I imagined about her. She came to my mind, and I felt a new rush of happiness, and I wanted nothing more than to hold her forever.</p> <p>When I opened my eyes, her beautiful eyes were already closed. Just as the morning dawned I saw her in the mirror. She had her head back, my hand lightly caressing her neck, her beautiful face. I thought we made eye contact all around, when she saw me, and turned to me. She leaned forward, her right hand holding my face, her lips barely touching my own. I think I melted inside, with that first soft kiss on my lips. A smile creased my face at the pleasure of it.</p> <p>But the rest of the day was not to be, we didn't have much time. She must have gone to the store or something, or she had something to do, which we didn't notice or bother to notice. Every once in a while I would look back to her, but she was not there.
