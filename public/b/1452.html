It was always their usual Thursday evening after dinner and she hated seeing her parents and they'd be down to the living room watching a movie.</p> <p>They arrived late, and Toni couldn't resist a quick kiss on the cheek from her mother. "Well, are you going to try and make a date with the manor?"</p> <p>"No, you bet I am! And it doesn't get any worse than that, does it?" Laughed the girl, "I'm Tanya, your friend."</p> <p>"Nice to meet you Tanya, I haven't had the chance yet since my wife left last Christmas. What's your name."</p> <p>Tanya giggled and gave her friend a quick shake, "Toni!"</p> <p>"My name's Toni. Are you two enjoying my country hospitality?" Toni looked over at the man outside the door, as he had been doing earlier.</p> <p>"Uh, not really," he mumbled.</p> <p>"What do you think you are doing?"</p> <p>Toni had a good memory of what he meant, and was about to say something when her mother's words stopped her. "Well, if you're not trying to have sex again, maybe we should just go and have a drink, you have had a good evening!"</p> <p>Toni didn't know what to think about that, and she certainly didn't want to go and have a drink, let alone have sex again. Her friend had turned her down and she didn't think her parents would go through with it. She was already over the line of the old saying that if you weren't going to have your first drink, you should just go get yourself fucked.</p> <p>*</p> <p>Tanya walked past the table over lunch time and saw that her mother's face was covered in dried tears. "Why are you crying so hard", she said to the man, "you did something I didn't think was going to happen." She knew the man wasn't going to say anything. She also knew it meant she wouldn't get her next drink of the evening as she wasn't going to be out for more than an hour. "Come on, just get home so we can talk". Tanya did her best to ignore her mother's words, and started walking out, when she stopped in the doorway. "What is it that you want?" she asked, and saw the look of shock on her mother's face. "Oh, honey, don't stop" her mother was now pulling Tanya's face down into hers, kissing her as her mother's tongue worked its way into her throat.</p> <p>When the kiss stopped, Tanya looked up at her mother in surprise, "Mom, can't you wait until after lunch?" she asked her mother. "I still can't believe I let you kiss me like that all afternoon just because..."</p> <p>"Oh, I'm sorry, honey. Do you like being kissed like that?" Mother smiled down at Tanya. "I love it! Now we just need to see if we can get some more of that. I know you're tired, why don't you go get to bed before you go to sleep?" Tanya sat down at the table and watched her mother as her mother helped her up, and then she sat down and pulled up her skirt, and slipped a pillow over her face. She could hear Tanya breathing harder, and knew she wanted to talk.</p> <p>*</p> <p>After just a little over two hours she had found a quiet room with just the table, and Tanya had gone back upstairs to the living room once she got into the bed. Her mother was still in the arms of her, as they'd kissed, and now she couldn't help but feel more and more comfortable, than before. She'd never had a lover before, let alone had sex like that with another woman.</p> <p>When her mother got under the covers, Tanya was shocked to find she wasn't wearing panties. "Are you sure you don't want to see me just now?" she giggled as her mother moved her legs and sat up against the head rest. "I don't think I could stay if you wanted to make a move on me honey. You've already had sex with your husband, we can just have a gentle kiss instead." Tanya felt her heart leap, and she kissed her mother tenderly on the lips. "Honey, you know you liked the kiss, and you should try kissing your mother." They kissed like that for a long while, and Tanya couldn't help but feel guilty about what had happened and howâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
