She began pumping herself on my spike without missing a beat.</p> <p>"I want to cum. Do you want to cum?" she moaned.</p> <p>"Yes," I moaned back.</p> <p>"Do you want to cum?" she asked in a husky tone.</p> <p>"Oh yes."</p> <p>"Then cum, baby," she said. I moaned, wanting her more. Her cunt contracted around my spike. I felt myself tightening, she was cumming too. Suddenly, my cock erupted. I shot spurt after spurt of my seed into her pussy. We moaned and moaned in unison as the orgasm ripped through our bodies. I thrust my hand under her ass to push her over the edge. She clenched down on my prick like a vise.</p> <p>After recovering, she leaned over the couch, pulling me into her. Her legs spread wide. Her mouth sought mine. Our mouths wrestled. Her hands spread her cunt wide while her cunt filled with my cum. She sucked and licked my tongue until I began to soften.</p> <p>Then she stood up and leaned over the back of the couch. Leering at me, she said, "I've never fucked someone this hard, before."</p> <p>"So did I," I groaned as I leaned over her, kissing her.</p> <p>I had been so caught up in the moment of her passion, that when we broke our kiss, I turned, putting my finger in my mouth to taste the cum I had left in me. She smiled at me as she reached back, fumbling around until she had my finger clean. She took my finger in her mouth and sucked the cum out of it. With a smile on her lips, she reached up and grabbed my throbbing cock, stroking it gently while we continued to kiss. Looking down, I saw her rubbing the tip of my cock between her thumb and first two fingers.</p> <p>"I guess I should get a condom," I said breathlessly as she looked up at me.</p> <p>"Mm-hmm," she agreed, "But we don't have to ..."</p> <p>"I know," I said, "but I thought you might like it."</p> <p>"I do. And it felt so good," she said, licking her fingers.</p> <p>"Me too," I agreed. Looking down at her, I leaned her down onto the couch. I put my hands on either side of her as I kneeled in front of her, pulling her closer to me. I kissed her again, softly and deeply. Her mouth opened and my tongue found hers as our tongues entwined. My hands traced the contours of her body. I rubbed the nipples of her tits then moved down slightly, reaching her flat stomach. It glided my hand over her flesh as my fingers reached the waistband of the pants. Slowly, my fingers drew the crotch of her pants over her soft bush. She lifted her hips, allowing my fingers to slide under the fabric. I slipped my hand out of the way as my fingers trailed along her clit. Her body stiffened as I rubbed the tip of my middle finger against her.</p> <p>After a moment, my finger slid between her lips. It was still wet from my cum. I rubbed my finger across her clit, pushing it up toward her. I felt her quiver as my finger touched her. My finger continued to slide up and down over her clit until her body shuddered again. She pulled my hand away from her as she lifted her hips to my finger. Her hips rolled as my finger played with her clit. I pulled the finger away from her sex, then slid it back between her splayed lips as I watched her pussy tighten and relax around me. I brought it up to her mouth, teasing her lips with it as I slowly slid it inside her body. She suckled on my finger as it slid deeply inside her, then pulled it out of her mouth. She held my finger in place as she sat there, watching me as her cum coated fingers played with my cock.</p> <p>I leaned down, resting my face on hers as I kissed her once more. She took my head in her hands, holding my neck as she held my head back. I felt her lips part beneath my chin as I ran my tongue along each eyelid. Gently, I kissed each of her eyelids before I drew a line down to her forehead.</p> <p>"You're beautiful, Marcy," I said as I kissed her eyelids, "so beautiful." Her eyes closed. Her lips curved up and her nostrils flared. She tilted her head slightly with my head between her legs. I kissed each eyelid softly. Slowly, I kissed along her neck. I felt her shudder. Her chest rose and fell with each breath. Her eyes closed and her lips parted slightly.
