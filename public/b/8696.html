"This is the real deal. This is your pussy." I push her forward, then push inside her again. I look down at her face and see her pupils dilate, as she relaxes her muscles to take my whole cock. I can hear her breathing speed up, and she can feel myself grow even larger. She is clearly ready. I watch, mesmerized. I know her body as well as her brain when I can see it, all the way down to the bones. I run my hands over her body gently as she squirms, trying to relax my cock. I can feel her heart thumping in her chest as she moves toward another orgasm. I let my hand run down her body again, gently this time, and then push it back up. All the way over. "I am going to fuck you so hard you are going to scream for it," I state. "Tell me what you want me to do."</p> <p>She doesn't know of course, but she opens her eyes and sees me standing over her. She is almost ready to cum again. "My lips, I want your lips." She moves my hand up a little to kiss my hand on her lips, and then kisses my hand on her pussy again. She is hot as I watch .</p> <p>I continue moving in and out slowly as she works her hips with my hand, moaning softly when I push in her at an even greater angle, and her eyes are closed now. I have to concentrate, but a moan escapes as I feel her body starting to quiver again. I look down to her face, and it's clearly her eyes have rolled into the back of her head and, her mouth hung open almost in an O.</p> <p>"You like it?" I ask. She doesn't answer, just mewls her head "yes". I continue, feeling her muscles start to relax, and moving faster now. I watch her face again. She looks like she is just about to lose consciousness as her whole body starts to quiver, then she closes her eyes again, and her breathing is ragged.</p> <p>My cock is hard now even more inside her, pushing her pelvis hard into my groin. I am moving faster now, pumping my dick into her tight little pussy. She moans loudly as she feels every pulse, every twitch. We are both sweating as we thrust, and I take her hips, forcing them to fuck me as hard as I can. The skin between my hands, her neck and shoulders is slick with perspiration. I can't hear her heavy breathing, but feel her body move with me, as I rub her clit with my thumb. She pushes her mouth up for a final moan, and opens her eyes.</p> <p>"I love you!" She cries out. I am almost there, and thrust in her hard, my balls tingling like they have not for ages. I do not stop, pushing in as far as I can go. I try to hold it, to hold out. She is moaning, but can only moan in pleasure. Her breathing is ragged now. Now the passion is gone and she's just lost in the sensations. Every muscle in her body is tensed, like a big, thick clump of muscle I am trying to hold in. I cannot stand it any longer. I want this to end. I pull out as far as I can get, just as slowly to leave my cock inside her, then push in again as I come down on her, and finally she is open, totally exposed to my body.</p> <p>This is it. This last moment has come: she knows she cannot stop me now. I can feel every muscle in her body pulse as her orgasm explodes upon her, and she collapses with me, as I lay on top of her. I can't breathe, she is too hot. We hold each other too closely for comfort.</p> <p>I roll off her, and she reaches up to hold me. There is a new feeling of intimacy then, as we both relax. She feels safe with me, and loves me. I do not want to lose her, although I think I may have lost her once. "Was that good?" I ask, and it is true. I love her, I really do.</p> <p>"Very good, my love."</p> <p>I do not let her go, I am happy to be holding her. I do not want to leave. It would make me feel better to leave her, if I could stay. But, I want to stay. I have no regrets; I just hope she feels safe with me. I know I wouldn't be able to hold all of her. We lie there, breathing heavily with our heartsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
