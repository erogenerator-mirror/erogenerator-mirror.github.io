He took me in his arms, then slowly unbuttoned my blouse, allowing the top to fall open. I took his hand in mine, pressing it into my cleavage as he pulled me toward him, almost kissing as I reached to unzip him. He stepped back and I let loose his pants, helping him slide them down his long legs, my skirt flying open. I sat back on the bed, naked as the day I was born, with my long red hair cascading over his bare thighs. I leaned my head back against his crotch, feeling him swell up inside me. I let my hand slide down his flat stomach, over his hardness, my palm stroking up to his tip. I knew we shouldn't be doing this. He's my father! What would he say if I was caught? He slid his finger inside my mouth, kissing it, my tongue wrapping around his length, his fingers entwining mine, his thumb caressing my clit.</p> <p>"Let me," he said, kissing me again, his fingertip on my clit as he slid down between my legs, his hard erection rubbing against me. I reached down, his hardness against me, my fingers caressing his, his mouth, my tongue. I leaned back against his lips, feeling his tongue trace over me, and then enter me. He slid into me. "Oh dad!" I groaned, pulling him tighter, pushing him into me, my wetness running down his legs as he plunged into me.</p> <p>"Ohhhh, yes, like that," I moaned. "Take me, sweetheart," he whispered into my ear. I started to lift him away but he held me back with his strength. "Take me, mom!" His erection seemed to lift with his words. I knew what I wanted, what drove me. He wanted it, too, and if I was going to give it to him, I felt I'd better do it my way. I slid one hand down his body, his hardness filling my hand as I slid it down to his thigh, stroking him slowly between my fingers. Then I slowly pulled his hand up, holding him there as we enjoyed ourselves.</p> <p>He rolled over onto his back as I slid my panties down, his cock springing out as it came free, a thin thread of pre-cum shining wetly in the pale, silky material. My hand grasped it, feeling him throbbing in my hand as I slowly ran back up the length, pausing at the tip, my fingertips teasing him as they slid down the shaft, over the slit, then up to his head. It seemed to take forever to pull his head out of the way, but finally it came free, dripping on his thighs. I was about to kneel down between his legs again, when he stopped me.</p> <p>"Wait there," he said, pointing to the nightstand drawer.</p> <p>"What? What are you doing?" I couldn't believe I'd done that: just as I thought all men wanted to.</p> <p>He reached under the bed and took out his small vibrator, the kind you use to get yourself off. "Let me," he said quickly. I looked down the bed at him, looking at his hard cock, then down again at his hand on his cock, then up at him. His hand ran up and down the length of his shaft, his fingers teasing at his end. He pulled himself a little closer, so the tip of his head was against my lips.</p> <p>"Suck me," he commanded. I hesitated. "Now." As if he could read my mind, he moved closer to me. I opened my mouth, feeling his warmth touching my lips before opening more. My tongue slipped out to caress his lips as the vibrator was replaced by his finger again. I slid my lips over him, feeling his thickness, his hardness against me. I slid the tip past my lips; I knew what was coming. I felt the heat, the slippery moisture. I felt his finger sliding up in my slit, then back down again, over my clit. I felt him start pumping into me as his fingertip teased my button. He started to enter me with his finger, sliding up and down my wetness. It was hard not to want him to, and I kept trying to imagine what it would feel like to be like. His finger slid up inside me, slowly, pressing against my g spot, and the vibrator began to slide along my walls. In my mind, it was as if I was sliding inside of him, not just his finger. I felt his cock slide fully inside me, pressing against my ass. I started to slide down, feeling as if he was splitting my ass in half. All the while, his cock was sliding across my clit, moving the vibe in and out of meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
