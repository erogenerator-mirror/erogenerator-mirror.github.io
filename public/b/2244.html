I said. Her mouth stayed right on mine as she ground her hot pussy against mine. It had become an even tighter connection, my fingers had dug into her cheeks and her body was twisting and arching all over. "That sure feels good!" I cried, pulling her mouth free for a moment. The sounds of our bodies joining seemed to be echoing off the walls of the building. I pulled her up, holding her for just a moment until she came down. Her lips were tight and wet between mine, our kiss went on for a good few seconds, our tongues caressing, tasting and teasing one another like nothing ever had done.</p> <p>We kissed for a few moments, then she reached down between us, grabbed by shirt and yanked it over my head. The two of us were naked, the warmth from her body making my body shiver. "Come on," she said, "I want you inside me." I felt her lift herself up and I felt myself sink down between her legs, my hard cock rubbing against her wet pussy.</p> <p>"I want to feel you come in me," she whispered to me, then pulled back, then pushed herself back up on me. I felt my cock slide up into her, feeling her pussy walls grasp tightly around me, and then I was completely inside her. Her breathing was raspy and hot, and my cock slid out of her as I stood still. She dropped down against her side, her weight pressing against me and her arms wrapped around me tight. We stood there for a couple of seconds, our legs in a tangle, then she began to slide back up the wall. We stood there, me inside her, her weight pushing me back until we were pressed against the wall, our arms wrapped around each other. It was perfect. We stood there, kissing tenderly and letting our hands roam. We moved against each other, both of us feeling the pleasure. We broke the kiss, and I looked into her bright green eyes and smiled. I was happy. I was sure that all the people had come in right by now, I was sure. Our bodies were pressed against each other, my hands slid up to her breasts, her arms slid around my waist, and up to her face. I pulled her lips onto mine, letting her body slide against mine. She kissed me back, and her hips slid back and forth against mine while we kissed, the two of us moving in the perfect rhythm of pleasure. Her hand slid down between us, then up to my cock as it moved between her legs, the skin of it on her fingers gliding across her clit as we kissed. She had that look in her eyes, something I would have never had the nerve to do in the beginning. I leaned in and kissed her long and deep, and her body shuddered against me. My mouth on her neck, her ears, her earlobes, her throat; I slid her lips back and forth over mine. Our kisses grew more passionate, more sensual, until we found ourselves thrusting together, our body and hands all over the other. I lifted her up so our chests were pressed together as I thrust into her, feeling the way her hips moved against me in rhythm with mine. Her breasts felt as I lifted them, her head tossed from side to side, and our kiss got deeper, more passionate, but still somehow, still somehow, still. She wrapped her arms around my neck, squeezing my body into hers with the force of her need. It took a couple more thrusts before we broke the kiss and looked into each other's eyes, then we found our mouths and lips again. I felt the weight of her body as it pushed against me and when our lips parted, it was only seconds before she came, squirting her juice back down my cock. She kissed me again, and I reached my hands up to her hair to lift her face away from mine.</p> <p>"God, that was incredible!" she exclaimed, and I held her face in my hand as the orgasm washed over us. We sat there on the wall, looking at each other as we enjoyed the feel of each other. We didn't do anything more than kiss. We were too lost in each other to notice the world around us start to spin. We kissed until our bodies were spent, and I slid her down against the wall, my hands on her body. She lay down, then lay there before lying down and opening her legs. I got on my knees on the floor in front of her, and her legs came back together as I came closer. When my mouth found hers once more, our bodies made perfect contact. My eyes closed and my arms went around her, holding her close to me as we kissed and felt one another. We held each other like that for a long time, neither of us daring to move. It was magical. I wanted to lie there forever, but I realized that the only reasonâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
