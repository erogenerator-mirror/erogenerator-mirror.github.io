"Or would you like something stronger, just in case you're going to be late?" she joked as she turned to go. He did as she asked and got a cup for both of them. They both walked back to their seats and looked over the menu.</p> <p>"So, do you think you would like this coffee?" he said as he reached to cup back and took a sip.</p> <p>"I think you're as drunk, as I am," she replied with a devilish smile. "I can't believe we're having coffee with each other!" she squealed as she threw her arms around his head and gave him a French kiss full on the mouth.</p> <p>"Yeah, right," he said in a mock-drunken tone of his own to her.</p> <p>"Yeah, right," she replied back. "I can't believe I'm making out with you!" she went on as she kissed him on the lips once again and they both laughed.</p> <p>"You know we can't let either one of us get too drunk," she continued to mockingly add as she sat her down on the sofa again. "Let's just give the guys a moment before this," she stated as she pulled out the chair across from them and sat down.</p> <p>"Oh, that's a good idea," Dan said as he reached to get the chair behind them. "But I really don't want to get too drunk," she said as she reached over and started to unbutton his shirt.</p> <p>"Why don't you just let me have this first," he said as he helped her take off his shirt. She undid his belt and zipper, then slipped her bra off as he reached behind her to unhook her skirt. She was wearing a thong with a white lace trim, and he immediately began to pull it away so he could see her shaved pussy.</p> <p>"Ah, I see you're taking things slow today!" she giggled as he slid his pants down and off of his legs. They returned to the table in their underwear and sat down opposite each other. Dan was now fully dressed, with his cock hanging between his legs. She slowly pulled off her panties as he slid his pants completely off as well.</p> <p>"And now the main event," she said, as she got up on her knees to position the coffee making utensil in front of him. Just as she had before, she pulled off her shirt and bra as she positioned the coffee making container next to the machine on top of the kitchen table. Dan was now fully dressed and looking like his old self, not old even once he had the breakfast on. "I'm naked but for my panties!" she said as she put the container on the table next to the coffee maker and set the utensil and coffee out on the table in front of him.</p> <p>"So it's about to get even better," he said with a devilish smile on his face as he took in a deep hit from the coffee maker as it filled with his coffee.</p> <p>"You're right, it feels good, and yes it is making me more than just horny," she teased as she took another sip of coffee.</p> <p>"So let's have a coffee," he said to her.</p> <p>"Okay," she said as she stood up and went over to him to put the container back on the table. "If we're going to have a coffee together, we can't just just sit and watch each other," she quipped as she stood up now standing with her back to him. He reached and put the container back on the table as he leaned forward and kissed her on the lips once again. As she returned to the table, she slowly leaned over and pulled him with her until he was seated. As both of them looked over the menu, she pulled up the table, which was slightly shorter than a couple of tables on the way to the kitchen, and put it up on the back of the table next to the table they were sitting at, while Dan sat back against the back of the chair. They began to make small talk while looking each other in the eye and eating.</p> <p>"You don't mind if I join you?" Dan asked her as he picked a piece of bacon around his fork.</p> <p>"Not at all," she said as she leaned her head back and smiled.</p> <p>"Good idea," he responded as he took a piece of bacon as well as a piece of his toast into his mouth and chewed on it slowly.</p> <p>"Good, because it tastes great," she said as she looked over to see him getting an odd look in the restaurant mirror and he said to her. â€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
