It moved over.</p> <p>'No!'</p> <p>Her hand reached. 'No?'</p> <p>I shook my head.</p> <p>'No, never!'</p> <p>Her fingers traced the outline of my pubes while mine reached for her thigh, and I moved slightly away, feeling her fingers moving higher. Her own body writhed against me. She moved her fingers to rest against my pubis, feeling my hardness, and slid them down to my testicles. I gave a gasp. It was big, and quite hard. She caressed it, feeling it.</p> <p>'I know you don't like it,' she murmured.</p> <p>'I don't know if I do, but it's certainly different. I mean, I didn't think. But I suppose you're a man; at least, that's why I didn't make you all those years ago.'</p> <p>Now it was her turn to murmur.</p> <p>'I'm so glad it's you that I had. I hadn't been sure, so it was something I was trying to take on board, seeing how much you seemed to like it.'</p> <p>'So far?'</p> <p>'And it's the biggest I ever got. And I didn't want to wait. But maybe you'll like me too. I really do want your cock inside me today. Is that okay?'</p> <p>Even as she spoke, her hand had found its way inside my boxers to rest against my rigid flesh, her fingers stroking my length. She squeezed, tugged, and stroked. Her fingers found the place I needed them most.</p> <p>I wanted to groan. I moved my hips up, and she pulled away, pulling herself down until her lips rested on my chest.</p> <p>'God,' she breathed. 'I can't believe we're doing this. I can't believe how hard it is to resist, and how much of a turn on it is for me, even with all that I've taken.'</p> <p>She began to bob her mouth back and forth on me. From our previous experience, when she'd come to me for more than just a blowjob, I was pretty sure that the sensations were coming from the inside. I'd never felt anything so good. I'd only imagined masturbating to it, had no idea what to make of that. I'd never experienced the feeling of having both my balls and my cock touched as both sets of hands were pleasuring them. And being naked together was such an arousing experience. I was aware that both sets of lips were exploring me, but I'd have to admit that it was the best feeling I'd ever had. Especially when I'd never known any other woman with an orgasm like hers.</p> <p>It didn't take much to push me over the edge, my hips arching hard, thrusting my cock deeper into her hot mouth. She gagged, spasmed, coughed, coughed, and pulled out, looking up.</p> <p>'Oh God!' she moaned. 'I can't believe I did that. It felt... well, I don't know. You're much different to me. I was surprised at your sensitivity.'</p> <p>She smiled at me, and kissed and licked my chest. She was still kneeling, but lifted a leg over my thighs and moved them back towards my groin. I groaned at the prospect of her warm, wet lips on my cock, the sensations that her tongue had been teasing on my balls.</p> <p>Soon as she'd kissed them, I lifted my hips and pulled her mouth back to my erection.</p> <p>'No, no,' she breathed, and kissed the head. 'I want it inside me, please. I want it now!'</p> <p>Her hands moved down my body, trailing the strands of her hair down to my belly. Her fingers traced the edge of my pubic hair, and I knew that her kisses and licks were heading the same direction.</p> <p>In a move that would have been too much for me, she'd knelt down and taken my cock in her hand, pushing it forward until it was resting against my stomach. Now her head was above me, and she had her lips at the base of my cock all along the length of it.</p> <p>'Oh God,' I moaned, my thighs shivering as she sucked. And she was, because her hands moved back up, around my balls, and she took each in turn to the other. She licked the tip of my cock, her tongue coming back up to taste me. She wrapped her lips around me, took me in so deeply as to make me gag, and began to bob her head up and down on me. I groaned, my hands tightening into fists at my sides. My legs were starting to trembleâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
