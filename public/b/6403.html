Don't fret."</p> <p>She smiled back, "You're going to have to leave tomorrow to do that."</p> <p>"No, it's all right." I said, "I just know I couldn't be all that happy in my life if I had to leave for a while."</p> <p>"Maybe not forever," she said, "but I had to take care of you."</p> <p>"That sounds nice."</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"I just thought maybe we could sleep together for a while."</p> <p>She laughed and replied, "You're silly. I'll get the bed ready."</p> <p>They climbed the stairs into the room and it was a wonderful sight to watch as they climbed into bed. She reached behind her and took my hand, "I'm sorry. I guess I got carried away."</p> <p>"I know. It's the first real love making of your life. You know how much I love to make you happy."</p> <p>A few minutes later, she said, "I'm ready. I'm really ready for you. I want us to make love."</p> <p>"Good. Now lay down on your back."</p> <p>She lay down, her legs dangling over the side of the bed, her arms stretched over her head and her hands cupping her face, smiling, waiting, and thrilled just thinking about what she would and wouldn't do. I crawled on the bed between her legs, reached down, and with one easy motion, my cock slid into her warm, hot nest.</p> <p>"Oh my God!" she said, "It feels soooo good."</p> <p>"It does! I hope it would feel even better."</p> <p>"Oh, now I want you all over me, so that I can feel what it is like to cum in my pussy."</p> <p>We rested for a while and I was so excited I almost forgot she was there. When she was able to move, I kissed the top of her head and went back over to the bed, where she lay still. I crawled up and onto the bed to rest my head on her tummy, and I placed a hand lightly on her stomach. "I want to make you feel good."</p> <p>"I'm very happy right now." she said, "You're making me feel really good." She pulled her hand from my ribs and moved it down so she could feel my cock which was getting hard again. I laid back and closed my eyes as she took my cock into her hand lightly and began to move up and down the shaft, not up and down, just sort of sliding up and down.</p> <p>"This feeling is absolutely divine!" she whispered softly in my ear.</p> <p>"That's a beautiful feeling! When I have you in my hand and in my pussy, and when we play with each other, every nerve in my body is alive, no pun intended, and you make me feel wonderful, wonderful good." And then, I felt her hand begin to move to the end, and her body moved back and forth so that it was rubbing my cock.</p> <p>"Ooh, that feels great!"</p> <p>"Mmhhh!" she murmured. Then she began to work her hand a little faster, and she knew that was good for her. "There's something else that you can do for me also."</p> <p>"What's that?"</p> <p>"It's just something that I love you doing this with me so much."</p> <p>"Doing what?"</p> <p>"Making love. Let's just say I love taking your cock in my pussy."</p> <p>We rested for several minutes, and she then turned to me and kissed me deeply. "This was wonderful. It felt so good."</p> <p>"Mmh. I think that you have a wonderful gift."</p> <p>"Oh, so nice." she said. "How about it, baby?"</p> <p>"I don't know. I wish I was the one here doing it."</p> <p>"Oh, you may think that is a good idea."</p> <p>"Well... maybe you are."</p> <p>"Mnnh. I'm just thinking that I wish we could do this more often."</p> <p>"Mmm-hmm. This was delightful. I love doing this with you."</p> <p>"I love you, too."</p> <p>"I love you very much. We're lucky, somehow, to get each other on our honeymoon, for I think we can get along just like we have always wanted to and I think it would give us a chance to be together as husband and wife."</p> <p>"It's just that.... that's kind of a big surprise. A big dealâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
