She placed her head on his shoulder and kissed his shoulder blade; her right arm snaked up his body and gripped his torso and shoulder; she looked up as he turned and put the pillow over his head and lay back in the tub. He took one of his knees and she lay on top of him; she wrapped her arms around him as they cuddled for a few moments. They kissed lightly; they both liked that.</p> <p>“How I wished my daughter’s lips tasted like her son’s was in the morning,” she told him.</p> <p>They sat in silence for a long time; then she looked up; she kissed his lips, he returned it with the same intensity that he used in the tub. They stood in the bathroom as she kissed his face and rubbed his chest; his arms found the ties of her dress and pulled it off of her. As the dress came undone she lifted it over her head so he could look her body.</p> <p>“You can see how much I like to look,” she told him as she unbuttoned his shirt.</p> <p>“I do not wish to be too much at home,” he replied, he helped her out of her dress and then it was off and he was staring at her perfect body.</p> <p>She ran her hands down his sides making his body jump; he was breathing hard with anticipation. She kissed each of his nipples in turn and she felt them growing harder under her fingers. As she reached down to rub his hard shaft, he pulled her up on to the bed, she pushed him backwards; he lay down and she straddled his hips; she stroked his thick hairless chest; she let her tongue trail down his stomach and over his erection; she began to lick it in a circular motion and she could feel the soft flesh against her tongue. She took his cock gently between her moist lips and began to suck on half-hard but with her lips sealed around the helmet. She bobbed harder and deeper onto him; taking his balls and gently pulling. He grabbed the backs of her thighs and began to rub her crotch, he moved one leg forward to give himself better access and pushed himself up to her harder. She moaned around his shaft, she moved against him; she was going to give him much pleasure if his son. And he wasn’t quite yet.</p> <p>He rolled her over onto her back again and she moaned, she loved being in control. With her legs stretched out, they rested on his shoulders; she gripped around his head; she knew that he liked to look down between her legs and watched closely as he licked around the opening of her pussy.</p> <p>“God I love your cock in me, please give me more!” she begged.</p> <p>She was ready for his attention now. He lifted her legs up so that they overlapped and then slid in easily; she was wet again from his attentions on her but he had not fucked her; she felt as though he was fucking her with his thick cock now. It had always been her favorite thing for him to see but since they had been together this night he had never enjoyed it too much.</p> <p>“Baby, I can't hold back now, I am going to come!” he told her with a laugh. “I need to give you something to cry for me to cry for you”</p> <p>“I wanted to be yours forever,” she replied in a very matter-of-fact voice. “Come inside me, I love you inside me”</p> <p>He pushed her back; she lay back a little and spread her legs wide; she loved to be spanked. He stood next to the tub with his cock in hand; his hands went down from her thigh before the water; and then came to her waist; they embraced as they kissed, she opened her mouth and met his tongue. She broke the kiss and looked in his eyes; his gaze was intense and intense; she smiled broadly as she felt the weight of his body against hers; he began to move; she ran her hands over his face on all sides; she wanted his lips on her everywhere.</p> <p>He pulled away as his mouth and tongue explored her lips; she felt both at the same time. He lowered himself down, and took her hips in his hands and began to move in a steady rhythm of small short thrusts that would only send her racing toward the abyss; she moved her other hand to his head for stability, she liked to look into his face in the dim light that filtered outside. Her pussy began to leak juice as she felt the slickness of his body against her.</p> <p>He pulled—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
