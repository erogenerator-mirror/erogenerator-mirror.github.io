She wasn't gay anymore. She wasn't a guy, after all. But not even she was sure she could say that to him. She'd been so upset with his sexual advances after all. It wasn't her fault, they were only temporary and there was no going back. No way in hell, no way! She'd had the most wonderful boyfriend over the course of two years. She couldn't change that but she'd be so angry if he were to find out that she hadn't been completely and totally fucked out, in his house, when she arrived to get married again. No way is she going to make it a permanent thing between them.</p> <p>The only thing to do was just give him the quick fuck of his life on his honeymoon. She'd take a lover of her own for a long, long time and she wasn't that sort of woman. If it ever happened again, she was going to lose it all again.</p> <p>He was right that one little slip was a little bit of a problem. And it wasn't like she wasn't interested in her own cock sucking skills. She was. And as often as she could, she was going to need it to go from a happy marriage to a miserable, lonely two-year relationship. She could just walk away and never look back. Maybe later, she thought to herself, he will be gone for nearly six months. Maybe that could be hard and scary for me. For a while, he'd be gone, all by himself and she wouldn't feel as alone as before.</p> <p>She was going to have to make peace with that. She was going to have to make peace with what had happened in that short time. And she wasn't going to let anything ruin it for her at all.</p> <p>After what had happened, after what hadn't happened in her life, she would just have to settle for whatever it took. She was going to have to get through this. She'd do everything in her power to make him happy. She really was going to stick to that decision.</p> <p>She didn't think she could.</p> <p>And she was just going to have to find another way to make him happy.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>The day that she'd spent with her new husband for a year was a whirlwind. They had been to several big city ball meetings and an even bigger wedding, to attend as many of their best friends and family as they could.</p> <p>She had no idea if he was still really her best friend and she couldn't tell whether he was in love with her or if there was any chance he wouldn't be, just as she was sure he hadn't been since they were together before and he probably loved her with all his heart. That meant that at least part of the reason he was going to propose to her was, quite literally, in a very big way. No matter how much she wanted to do it and even if she did want to get married and get her hair and nails done, she couldn't, and probably wouldn't, do it with him.</p> <p>It would be hard to ask, she thought as she remembered some of the conversations that had been going around her head when they were married. You know, it was something that seemed to everyone at the parties that he was proposing to her, something she and all the women in attendance were trying to pull together and it was going to work to his benefit. And they were trying it all, really and very, very hard. No amount of pressure, no way, was going to persuade her to do it. She wanted to do it so badly. It was just a matter of time before someone told her to do it. If she couldn't, she certainly couldn't!</p> <p>She was so damned happy.</p> <p>And she really couldn't see a way in doing it.</p> <p>She didn't want to talk about it or be able to talk about it at all. It seemed like the right thing to do, at least until it came up with something else she could use to get herself in a really good frame of mind and have control over her sex life. It was a good thing that she wasn't a virgin and even if some guy had asked her out tonight or her next month, it just wouldn't be the first guy she's ever been with. No, it was a better idea to have a guy she'd never been with and it seemed like a great thing to do. But she didn't know what her life was going to be like and she was sure that her sex life wasn't going to be the same as it had been when they had been trying to get together for the last time. It certainly would seem like a good idea to him and he'd be up and about like everyone else.</p> <p>But it was going to be an even better idea to have another guy you can use to haveâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
