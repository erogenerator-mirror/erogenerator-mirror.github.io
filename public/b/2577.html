I knew I would spend some time outside enjoying the sunset, just like this.</p> <p>It was just right. In fact, so perfect.</p> <p>The soft yellow morning sun was giving me goose bumps as it slowly made its way towards my head.</p> <p>I closed my eyes and concentrated.</p> <p>When the sky opened again, it wasn’t a sun.</p> <p>It was a night sky.</p> <p>It was so beautiful.</p> <p>I smiled to myself as I lay there. The night sky was so beautiful.</p> <p>Yes, that was what I was going to do now.</p> <p>My mind floated in the night sky.</p> <p>I slowly opened my eyes again and noticed that it was almost dark outside.</p> <p>I wanted to take care of this right now.</p> <p>And I reached down to where I had been sleeping. I pulled back the covers and pulled them over me as I leaned over and reached down to pull them off.</p> <p>As I let them slide off my body I noticed that both the head and shaft had disappeared.</p> <p>The whole shaft was no more than about 3 inches in length. The skin, where it lay on top of the shaft was that little area that you just had to have to have to be able to see it move in and out of the area where it covered it.</p> <p>No hair anywhere on it.</p> <p>It appeared that it had been shaved and I could see a little brown spot on the top.</p> <p>The end.</p> <p>When I saw the head of my cock, it felt like a little finger. And it was starting to run up on itself. That little spot on the end!</p> <p>I reached out and touched it gently with my fingertips.</p> <p>I saw a drop of liquid form on the end of my dickhead and I couldn’t help myself. I leaned down and gently licked the tip.</p> <p>I could taste the little bit of pre-cum still there. The musky sweetness was intoxicating. As it slowly flowed down the shaft of my cock it had me even harder as I started to put more of it into my mouth.</p> <p>The sight of my own cock sliding into my wet mouth, my lips sealed around that gorgeous shaft, was almost too much for me to control.</p> <p>I slid my mouth down farther on that shaft until I was almost down to my balls. I could feel the head of my cock going deeper in his hole. He was definitely my new favorite. I moved my face away from him and went back down on it. My mouth started sliding up and down just as I knew he would, like on a blowjob.</p> <p>My lips slid over the shaft of my cock as I went, all the way up to the base where I stopped. Then I would slide all the way back down, taking the tip deep inside of me once again.</p> <p>I was fucking him to the rhythm of my mouth on him. So far, he was loving the way I was doing this. And I was loving each moment I was bringing him into to paradise.</p> <p>He started to move his hips up and down at my pace.</p> <p>I couldn’t tell if he was in a hurry to take in what I was doing, or if he was just being a gentleman. But the pace of his movements told me I couldn’t tell. He really was starting to love being sucked like this. As he began to thrust his hips into my mouth, I let out a little moan in approval.</p> <p>He didn’t say anything, or say anything, he just began to pump his hips up and down at my pace.</p> <p>It was so sexy.</p> <p>It was so easy to just do. He was just doing his job.</p> <p>I closed my eyes and slowly moved one hand down to his balls. I had one hand buried in his pubic hair and felt a little pressure as I slid my fingers through him, to the base, where I slid my hand back up to his shaft and then back.</p> <p>I had my other hand on his chest, just above his nipples.</p> <p>He was thrusting away at me, pushing down, and rocking upwards with me. His cock seemed to be thrusting into my mouth, even though it was far away. Every inch was hard and moving in-and-out of my mouth. I really couldn’t tell if he was still thrusting into me while I was sucking but it was definitely moving and I could tell from the sound of his head going around that his shaft was sliding over the length of his shaft again.</p> <p>I started taking him all out of my mouth and starting at the bottom with my tongue, which felt very—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
