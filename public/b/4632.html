He seemed to just go with it. Her breasts were pushed forward with every word, she loved that way.</p> <p>It was clear that by the time she rose again, he was already hard. She looked around to see how many men looked on her with a clear and undressing stare. She wondered which one of them would get to lick her first. She felt she would have liked him to take her virginity.</p> <p>With that thought, and her thoughts of him, she slipped him into her mouth. She was very excited by how good he tasted in her mouth, as he was already rock hard. So she moved her head forward until only the head of his cock was resting on her face. She rubbed the very tip of the head of his cock across her lips and then opened them wide. With his hand, he guided his cock head into her mouth.</p> <p>She wanted to say something, but remained in control of herself. She was going to take a penis in there and then, no holds barred. She wanted to enjoy that cock, all of it. She wanted to make him come in her mouth.</p> <p>She moved her tongue back to his cock. He liked it when she played with the tip just under the head. And then she slid her tongue further down, until her lips were pressed against him. She was going to have to push her tongue just inside to get a good sample before she went any farther to a finish.</p> <p>The thought of having her face fucked brought him close to his climax. As he felt his seed rising quickly, he told her to suck harder. For her part, she did as he just did. She did as he asked, giving his member as much attention as he gave hers. He watched his member disappear into her.</p> <p>When he had had enough, he pulled her up and lay her down on her back. He lifted her legs over his shoulders and then entered her. She loved feeling his cock slide in and out of her. He thrust into her a bit. Now he knew it would be easier to keep his penis in there as much as to take it out. He didn't hurry, just kept going. The first few times they went for a couple minutes, she thought it was almost painful. But she loved the feeling it would give her, the feeling of being a woman and the pleasure of the man's cock inside of her.</p> <p>Then, finally, he couldn't hold on any longer. He knew then that he was going to have to release his sperm inside of her, or she would scream out in pain and he would come again. All he could do was pump into her.</p> <p>While he was doing both, he asked her a question. "Honey, are you afraid of being punished? Have you ever been punished for doing it?"</p> <p>"Well, yes, I guess I have," she told him, "But it's different, it's different."</p> <p>"Different what?"</p> <p>"Different how it's done. Different, but different."</p> <p>"I guess so. I did it, but I didn't hurt you or make you come."</p> <p>"No, no, no I'm alright," she told him, "That's the whole point. It's all about how I feel. I wasn't making you come, I was just pleasing you."</p> <p>He reached down between them and stroked her breasts, but made no motion to touch them, but simply rubbed back and forth. She thought she was going crazy. She had wanted to tease him a bit before, but now she was so turned on and so turned on by it. She pushed her hips up against his hand to try and encourage him to do more. She wanted to enjoy this. The more he stimulated her, the more she wanted to enjoy it.</p> <p>Eventually, all he was doing was rubbing her tits. The he moved his hand around to her pussy so that he could run his finger across her clit. Even this was teasing her, making her clit stand out in anticipation, then he would flick it with his finger. This was something new for her. Even though it was exciting, all she wanted was to touch herself.</p> <p>She was getting close to orgasm when she felt him lift her up and lay her on her back. This position allowed him to have access to any of her. She opened her legs even wider. He took one of his hands and ran it under her so her clit was exposed. He then ran the tip of his finger up and down her lips. It was exciting to feel his finger on her clit with his palm.</p> <p>He slid his finger between her lips as far as he could go and then moved it around. It was so different to having him touch her directly. He moved it around a bit and then back down, across her clit. He could doâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
