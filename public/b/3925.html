I moaned out as I spasmed and pulsed so hard that my whole body started tingle and flutter. My body, all of it, seemed disconnected at the edges of my being for the moment. It was so real, like it was my own body, and it was being used just like I wanted to be used, to be abused, to be made to do what I wanted. Even though I was being fucked by only one man, I had a connection with another man that none of them had ever known. It was all I could do to hold back my cries, for what little I could do to control myself.</p> <p>I came around him as he ejaculated in me again. He was making me cum, with a stranger. He was cumming in me, and I was cumming. My cunt got filled up again, I had never been so filled up.</p> <p>In some ways I felt better than I had ever felt before. I felt alive. For someone who couldn't remember being this way I was going to want to be one with him, to know how his cock felt inside me.</p> <p>He collapsed on top of me. He started to talk, but I could feel that he was in a daze.</p> <p>"I'm so sorry, I just can't believe you were in this... It made me feel so good, like I was in some kind of hypnotic state of ecstasy."</p> <p>I shook my head. It must have been a dream. I had this man all tangled up in my body and I no longer existed as a human being. I was on some kind of wild sexual adventure world. I could feel it, but if I were to wake I could be on some sort of sexual adventure tripâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
