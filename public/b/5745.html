Then I felt a cool sensation. It slowly dripped down her palm, across my stomach, into my pubic hair. I felt it trickle down my leg and she squeezed a bit, and her foot, then the other, came down and slipped my cock into her mouth. I felt the tip of her tongue slide along the top. The warmth and wetness of her mouth was intense and electric. Not so much a sucking session that was so pleasurable, but something else, something that was almost as good as I'd expected it to look, if I didn't have to admit it to myself, was actually a blowjob and, if she'd told me that one would never happen again, and probably to most men, would probably never be so good, I had to admit the truth of it. It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, and yet I still wanted her to touch me.</p> <p>She pulled away, and I felt the disappointment in her as she moved to my ass and her hand went to my hips. Then I felt the heat on my anus. It wasn't really as cold as I'd expected, with her hand I felt even colder, and then I felt both her hands. One was on my balls and I realized that she was taking them both in her mouth, and the other hand had slid over my cock as she rubbed it with the flat of her hand. She slid it both side and back, over the underside, and used both to open me up. Her tongue licked her way back to the tip, then went to my balls. I shuddered a little at the sensations, and her hand went back to my cock, where she had to go slowly, to keep it steady. Her mouth went to my ass again, and again my cock was licked, before going back to my balls. She was licking, sucking, and then taking each ball in her hand, all at once. I could feel my cock throb as she did this, and the pressure of her tongue in between each orb of pleasure was a bit extreme. I tried to moan but couldn't. I was trying to breathe again, and that meant there was more noise being drowned out by her mouth. I felt that familiar tug, that pressure coming from her tongue as she slid it back to my cock head, and then she kissed it and then kissed it again, and then again, again, and again and again and again.</p> <p>A wave of pleasure flowed through me as the tongue of our sex toy touched my skin. When the mouth of the other toy went back to my asshole, I actually felt it, a little rough, as the tongue licked it. Then I felt her fingers touch it a little on each side, and the sensation was like nothing I'd ever felt before. I didn't have to wonder what her fingers would feel like in my ass, or in my pussy, or in my mouth as the tongue of someone playing my sex toy on my hole, or as she was licking my asshole, or as I was licking my wife's husband's ass. I didn't really care about anything except that sensation. All the while she was licking me.</p> <p>"Oh, God!" I gasped, "Oh, God! Oh, God!"</p> <p>Suddenly there was a rush of sensation, and I knew that I'd never felt such an intense feeling with a man. I was suddenly aware that at this moment and then of the fact that the pleasure had not just gotten started, but that I was in my wife's mouth, and that it was only just beginning. I felt the first pulse. A surge through my cock and my belly and I thought there was a pressure on the roof of my mouth.</p> <p>"I'm cumming!" I cried out as a wave of pleasure flowed over me, then I felt my cock pulse just a bit more and the first jet hit my stomach in what seemed to be the same spot. But it wasn't just the second blast, it was what the first burst from my wife's mouth shot through me like the most powerful force of all the nerve endings firing. Some of it went straight to my cock head, some of it went up to my ears, some of it went straight to my brain, some of it made it to my mouth.</p> <p>By that point I had gone from thinking of what had just happened to thinking about it, to just laying there, trying to catch my breath, and when that sensation stopped, I was still trying to catch mine. Somehow that had gotten a bit weird. The shock that came over me as I felt the cum in my wife's mouth, my cock spurting, almost in the same spot it had done with my wife as I came, and my head pounding. It felt like part of me could get a shock, it seemed to be what I'd thought it was, but there was another part of me that was actually feeling it, andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
