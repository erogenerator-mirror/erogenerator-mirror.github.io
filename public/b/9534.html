She apologized before taking a last drink. "But I really need to get out of here, but we have the house to ourselves."</p> <p>"No, I have a nice place on the lake with some friends over there in the woods. How about you honey?" I asked and she laughed just before turning back to our drinks and a glass of wine.</p> <p>"I'm all yours." She replied and reached for my hand, pulling me toward her. "I just want to go for a drive in the warm spring air." Taking a deep breath, she pulled me toward the kitchen counter where our drinks sat. "Hurry up, I'm starving."</p> <p>I took her hand and let her slide to the living room then picked up our drinks and walked toward the front door.</p> <p>"I'm sure you better not put all this in your mouth, and in my place it can wait until we get home, or maybe even before lunch." I warned and she laughed. "But just the way we planned would make our night interesting," I added before closing the door behind us.</p> <p>The morning was beautiful as we sat next to each other at the kitchen island in our master bathroom. She put on her best smile and the sound of her heart beating only enhanced her excitement. I could see that she still cared for me, even though we had grown as close as children. If I wasn't her only love, I could have been there when my mother went to the grocery store and bought a nice dinner for us to finish when we finished. With the day off, our love for each other seemed a very strong thing to me. Maybe it was the wine, or the way we were acting but I could not help but feel it.</p> <p>It was a beautiful Saturday morning filled with birds singing and the birds' song was music to my ears. It was a beautiful day to be on the lake at the lake, especially after the hot summer days at college. We took our morning turns drinking until we were both out of breath. We didn't even try to hide our smiles when we reached the door to our suite.</p> <p>"Honey, I have to take these groceries to the store as well, I'm going to go shopping. Do you want to go with me?" We both laughed and took one more sip of our wine before turning toward our bedroom. She tossed her bag on her bed and I followed her to the shower. It had seemed so romantic when it took the air out of the small shower after our love making. The warm water splashed into her as we embraced each other.</p> <p>"Oh, this feels nice." We stood under the shower kissing passionately, our hands exploring each other's bodies. When I lifted her off the ground, she wrapped her arms around my neck and pushed her tongue into my mouth.</p> <p>"Please take me to the bedroom lover." She begged and I pulled her to her feet and led her to our bedroom and pushed her onto her back in the bed. I kissed my way down her body pausing to nibble on her nipples before I left a soft trail of kisses down her flat stomach between her legs until I reached her little jewel nest. I spread her labia with my fingers and parted them so I could see the pink interior.</p> <p>I began at her pussy with long slow strokes that would make her tremble uncontrollably as I pressed two fingers deep inside. The tip of my tongue danced over her swollen clit before it returned to her engorged pussy. Using my thumb I caressed her little button that never had been stimulated before. She was breathing so hard I couldn't hear her moans but her hips were arching toward my face. I continued the attention until she was thrashing about under me. Her pussy was throbbing and pulsating with every breath and she whimpered for me to stop.</p> <p>Suddenly she rolled onto her side, away from me. Her hand was caressing her hair and she was staring up at me, expectantly. I moved to her, kissed her, then lowered myself between her legs and began kissing her stomach. She spread her legs and I could feel that she was trembling with anticipation. At last, I slipped my tongue between her lips and slowly circled her clit. It was a sweet combination of moisture from her honey and the scent of her lovemaking. She groaned and lifted her ass in the air. "Oh, yes, please don't stop, I'm so close." she moaned and rolled onto her back, still breathing hard. I slid down between her legs and began licking and kissing her body; my hands were on her thighs and her arms were around the back of my neck. With my other hand I gently spread her lips and licked her engorged clit.</p> <p>"I want to make you cum, love, please make me cum!" she cried out and reached down to grasp my headâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
