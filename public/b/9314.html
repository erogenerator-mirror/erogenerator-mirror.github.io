Maybe we'll talk again. Oh, it's so good to see you," she says as she starts to gather her things. "You're a gem, Rob."</p> <p>"Thank YOU!" he says proudly, hugging her tight.</p> <p>She gets her things and they walk out the door without saying goodbye. The drive to Las Vegas goes by quickly, with the sounds of traffic and the cars passing overhead.</p> <p>When they get to the hotel, he opens the door to her room and they embrace, enjoying the feeling of having their bodies together. His hand slides down her back and she slides her fingers through his hair.</p> <p>"I need to clean up," she says, pulling back and putting her lips to his, kissing him passionately. The kisses are passionate, and she can feel his desire for her growing. She grabs his ass and pulls him in for another kiss, pulling him on top of her. He slides his hard cock into her wet pussy, and begins to thrust into her. Their kisses become feverish as he fucks her. He pulls out and she feels his sperm running out around her ass, and he puts his cock up to her mouth to clean the juice off. He puts that cock into her mouth as she sucks his cock clean, and then starts licking the rest of his cum onto her tits.</p> <p>They kiss and clean up, and then come up to the king-sized bed. He lays down beside her and she starts to kiss his soft cock as her hand roams over it. She kneels in front of him, taking his dick in her hand. She kisses the head of it, running her tongue over it, rubbing his shaft as she does so. She starts on head again, sucking his dick head and moving down his shaft. She stops at his balls, sucking them in her mouth, licking them as she does.</p> <p>"I want all of this in my mouth," she smiles, running her tongue around his shaft. He kisses her as she goes up and down his dick, licking it as well as the base. She stops momentarily, looks up at him and licks his balls as she does.</p> <p>"Would you like me to suck your cock?" she asks.</p> <p>"Oh yes," he moans with pleasure. Then, grinning as he looks at her, "I want you to really give me the fucking of my life."</p> <p>With that, she leans over and kisses his balls, sucking them between her lips. She licks the base of his cock, then up the head a few times. She stops again and licks all around the head. Then she takes his cock into her mouth, sliding down the shaft completely. He can feel her warm, wet breath all around his cock. She sucks him deeply into her mouth, pulling out a few times, letting the head move back up her throat. She can feel him grow, and she sucks him slowly, not wanting to just suck him off as hard as she wants, wanting release. His cock is hard, and he wants to fuck her now, in fact he couldn't wait any longer. He grabs her by her hips, and moves her up a little.</p> <p>"Come on, Rob, fuck me hard," she begs, "I need to fuck now."</p> <p>She straddles him as her knees touch him, her pussy right at his cock. He grabs her hips and pumps his cock in and out of her as he pushes her down against his crotch. She can feel him hitting against her G-spot as he thrusts his dick quickly in and out of her.</p> <p>"Oh, Rob," she moans as his cock hits her G-spot, "Fuck, I'm coming!"</p> <p>It goes on for a bit, and he pulls out, and she feels his sperm running down her leg. She pushes herself down on him hard as they cum as a mutual climax. He pulls out and lays down next to her, smiling as she falls asleep on top of himâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
