She reached out and slapped her mother on her right shoulder, making Mom jump and exclaim.</p> <p>“What can I do about that?” said Kate, “I am the same age as him and had no problem with showing up!”</p> <p>Kate took hold of Mom by her hips and swung her around the room to slap her mother again. “Don’t you dare make that mistake.” she said with her own fist to shake Kate off.</p> <p>“I am going to smack you in your own home.” said Kate, pointing the hand. “We are too young to get mixed up in what happens in the back of any car.”</p> <p>She bent down and slapped Mom again. This time she just caught her off guard and stopped when she felt Mom squirming. Kate started to slap Mom again but stopped when she saw that Mom was about to start to hyperventilate.</p> <p>Kate swung her hand hard into Mom’s right side. She brought it down hard against her mother’s sternum just below her chin.</p> <p>“Ow!” said Mom. She started to jerk her neck up and start to cough. Kate took hold of her right cheek and kept her hand there, holding her face. She felt Mom’s body jerking, as Kate slapped her, and decided that she would make sure she got two, then three strikes later. Kate smiled as she looked at her mother.</p> <p>“Are you going to stop fighting?” she said.</p> <p>“Maybe.” said Mom, with a weak smile. Kate smiled to herself and brought her right hand down again. Kate smiled and started again to slap Mom’s left side, which was beginning to hurt now, but she was able to make it go down without hurting her.</p> <p>“Your cheek looks bad” said Kate, smiling as she reached up and slapped the other upper side of her mother’s cheek. Before she could smack her again, Mom lifted her head and gasped, “Don’t you dare do that!”</p> <p>Kate gave her mom one more slap. ”I am not finished yet” said Kate. “I may even spank that cheek. Maybe your ass is too red too.”</p> <p>“No. Not at all.” said Mom. Kate started to move her hand back down, but stopped and raised her right hand again. She gave her mother another slap, then put her right hand on Mom’s hip and squeezed.</p> <p>“Don’t stop this now.” said Kate softly as she pulled back.</p> <p>“No.” said Mom with her eyes now closed. She was starting to cry.</p> <p>“Mom I think we have something to look at,” said Kate. She turned and looked up at the ceiling as she raised the paddle. “Is that what you were doing earlier?”</p> <p>“Nooo.” cried Mom. She dropped her head to the floor. Kate watched as she tried to stop but failed because she didn’t have the strength to stop her.</p> <p>“Mom, if you really don’t want to do this now I suggest you stop.” said Kate as she got up and turned around. She grabbed her robe and threw it on. “It’s time to take this thing off.” Kate looked at her mother as she opened her robe and said, “You may do this, Mom.”</p> <p>Kate stood up and let it do it’s business. The robe hung open a little and she looked like someone who was wearing a blouse or a bra. She pulled them off her shoulders to free her arms. She then stepped into her robe. She quickly tried to put it on and it fell back against her. She turned away from her mother as she bent to hook up her long and shapely legs. She looked at her and said “If I don’t do this now, this is the last time we will be here for a while.”</p> <p>Kate turned and left the room, knowing she had to stop this as soon as possible. She walked past Kate into the kitchen and went to the refrigerator. She looked in the bottom there and pulled out a box. Kate came back out with Kate’s robe and set it on the back of the chair in front of the sofa. She looked from left to right. “I think maybe a good old fashioned dinner will do.”</p> <p>Kate poured some wine in her glass and took a sip. She went over to the stove and leaned against the cabinet, while she looked at—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
