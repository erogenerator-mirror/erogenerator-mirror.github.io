This was going to be a fun trip. I had planned this for months just so we would do things together and in general I guess, this was going to be fun.</p> <p>I opened the door to the apartment and took in a step inside. "Wow," I thought, "This is getting interesting." I then turned around for another look at our new neighbor's. They were both in their late 30's and in perfect shape. They were both sitting on a couch in their den, which had a few recliners on it.</p> <p>They introduced themselves as Sam and Carol. Sam sat down on the couch next to Carol, and I noticed her arm casually rubbing down Carol's side. Carol had a small frame, a little overweight but not bad for a woman. "Hi!" said Sam, giving me a wide smile.</p> <p>I didn't know Carol was into me at all as I thought she probably wouldn't have minded it if we had been alone together for a while. "Hi again," I said as I sat down next to Carol on the recliner. I noticed Sam's eyes wander down to my crotch and I quickly tried to stifle a groan. I was having a hard time concentrating on anything but the heat of their eye-catching bodies.</p> <p>As Sam sat down, she pulled her sweater down from where it had been hanging loose on her arms and I knew the softness of her breasts were not obscured by her clothing, and I could see the rise and fall of her stomach, the subtle movement of her waist while she stretched. Carol didn't seem to mind, but Sam looked like she wasn't going to join her to chat with us. In fact, she was clearly enjoying the chance to get caught in their web.</p> <p>As Sam and I talked, she slowly moved closer to my girlfriend, sitting on the edge of the couch, with my wife on the other side. I was beginning to wonder if she was doing the same thing in front of me, watching my wife's breasts move with my girlfriend. That would be interesting to know, wouldn't it?</p> <p>Sam made eye contact briefly with me while she had me sitting. "I hope you approve," she said.</p> <p>Carol was blushing and clearly very uncomfortable. "It's okay," replied Sam. "We're trying to find a way to spice things up."</p> <p>"Are you serious?" I asked.</p> <p>"Yes, I am," replied Sam. "But I want you to be honest with yourself and let him know you're okay, not upset or upset with what he does or says."</p> <p>"That's very nice of you," I said. "But at the same time, I'm worried that he will be hurt or hurt for even an instant. He doesn't have the right to say anything, and frankly, I don't think he can do anything right."</p> <p>"We can talk it out," said Sam. "Sam's here with me right now. You could sit with them, chat. I'll just sit with my roommate at my place, you can sleep over if you want."</p> <p>"That sounds wonderful," I replied. "But how do we get this done? I don't want to keep Sam from being comfortable with us. I'm just not ready to lose my love for both of you in just this way. Maybe we should all sit down and let it be done."</p> <p>Sam looked at my wife, who seemed at least as eager to help as she was to get things started. "It's okay, honey," she said. "You get used to it, and things will go back to normal. Don't you worry about anything right now?"</p> <p>My wife nodded her head, still looking away from Sam and me. "I'm sure of that," she said. "He's a good guy."</p> <p>Sam and Carol got up and moved over to the sofa to sit with us. Sam was still facing me, which allowed me to be at a height right in front of Sam once again. I didn't know at what point we should start talking, but at that time of night, I felt sure that the only course of action to run was to begin this situation.</p> <p>As the conversation picked up, Carol said, "You know, we should try to find something more fulfilling right now. Maybe Sam or I might want to continue our friendship. Is she available?"</p> <p>Sam and I looked at each other just as the conversation changed. "Are you sure you want to do this?"</p> <p>Sam just smiled and said. "I'm sure," she said. "But I'm not sure if I should go."</p> <p>My wife turned to her and said, "If at all possible, we'd like it to be over now."</p> <p>Sam looked at Carol andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
