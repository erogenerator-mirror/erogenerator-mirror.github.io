She kissed me then and I could taste the saltiness of her lips on my lips as she ran her tongue over my teeth as we kissed. I thought it so erotic, having my lover lick her own come off her breasts. The kiss was not lost on either of us as it lasted for a good half hour, or more, it was between two lovers fucking each other, with her mouth firmly on mine as we both moaned each time the head of my penis moved over the lips of her swollen clit. I had never felt anything like that but I thought it must be heaven as we both moaned in unison.</p> <p>As I lay between her legs, my head between her breasts, she began to grind down on me in a slow grinding rhythm. Her hips were not at all tight on my penis or I realized she had no control over them. That had nothing to do with my cock. With each thrust, and she moaned in between her kisses, I could tell my member was almost fully exposed before her but nothing she or I could feel.</p> <p>Her own passion was becoming more intense as she leaned her head back and her body became more tense as orgasm after orgasm rocked her body. My hands and lips took on the same rhythm that her hips were taking on hers, taking in both pleasure and pain.</p> <p>I could hear her heavy breathing as she whispered a word or two in my ear and the motion of her body slowed and I felt her body soften.</p> <p>She laid back and pulled me down with her and we held each other. My cock once again began to soften, and she leaned backwards to kiss me. She was still on top of me as we looked into each other's eyes. As they did so, our kissing became more feverish in their intensity. My kisses were almost frantic too but she was able to catch herself, just a little.</p> <p>"Let's get up so we can lie down before we fall asleep. I'll show you something." With a grin, she got off me, turned the light off, and disappeared into the bathroom. I waited in the darkness, not wanting to make the first move.</p> <p>When she returned she was wearing the same dress she had on when I arrived from her car. She turned to me and gave me her body to caress. I ran my hands over her breasts, feeling her nipples as they hardened under my hands and kissed her deeply.</p> <p>"We'll have to start this off with a good fuck, if a good fuck is what it takes," I said.</p> <p>She smiled and laughed at me as she kissed me again, and laid me on my back. I kissed her neck as she began to mount me. I had never taken a woman's breasts in my mouth before but being naked in her cabin with her was definitely one of my new favorite pleasures. She rode me slowly at first, but gradually got more aggressive as she tried to get me to come inside her. She did this a couple more times, before she leaned in and began passionately whispering something in my ear.</p> <p>"We don't have much time" she whispered in my ear "We have to hurry". Then with a smile she kissed me long and deeply.</p> <p>We got dressed and drove down to the hotel. Arriving at my cabin we were both exhausted and excited but not completely satisfied. I took her in my arms and we kissed, gently, lovingly, longingly, but with no urgency. She had never had an orgasm like it, even when I had first entered her.</p> <p>She was not able to climax again after the first orgasm, but I was close. I began to thrust my cock inside of her again, and she responded in kind. This time I did not stop till she had another mini-orgasm.</p> <p>She kissed me hard on my lips, and after about five minutes, said "I'm about to come, please don't stop or change any way." She kissed me hard again and I said "Yes, please, just let me come." She looked deeply into my eyes, and smiled.</p> <p>I was on my way when she stood up and moved next to me. Our lips met briefly, and with our bodies touching, we began to move against each other. "Come again" she whispered.</p> <p>We continued kissing until suddenly she got very serious. "Now will you take me to bed?" she asked.</p> <p>She knew I was close to coming, and I said nothing, but I could feel my cock getting rock hard as I started toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
