I am still on my knees, facing away, hands resting on my thighs, as I hear you whisper into my ear, "Good girl. You don't talk on your knees, and you keep quiet. Is that a good girl?"</p> <p>I try to answer, but you continue speaking and I can barely speak now. "Yes, sir. Sometimes."</p> <p>I feel your fingers brush across the back of my neck, sending shivers up my spine. I can barely talk but you know how I like it. "Tell me again, slut. I want to hear you."</p> <p>More shivers run through my body as I wait, and in my mind, I am your master, and I obey. "Oh, yes Sir. I do not. I am to do what you ask, my Master. May I please...?"</p> <p>You lean forward and whisper in my ear, "Ask me, little one." And then we are kissing. The next thing I know, you are pressing my body back against the shower wall as you start to remove my clothing. I feel you pull a breast into your mouth, and you suck in on it hard, as you pinch another nipple and then the other one. It starts to hurt a little and I try to rub against your erection, but I don't think my movements will cause it. Suddenly, your hand finds its mark, on my breast, as you pull my body hard against yours. I can't help but cry out at the pain, or more, but I can be silent now. When you are done, I feel the water begin to run up my body, and the touch of your fingers, before you can reach my sex, I am so slippery. You grab me and start to stroke me between my legs, but I refuse to give you the pleasure. You know that this is only for you; that it belongs to me. When I turn over to look I realize the wet mark on my ass and you are smiling at my efforts to pleasure me. The next second you press your finger inside of me and, once again, I cry out.</p> <p>I can feel myself opening, and you know it wouldn't take much of a second to cum. Without warning, you slap my ass. I whimper but continue to hold myself still, while you continue to finger me deeper. "Open your eyes, and speak, slut," I hear you say. As the tears begin to trickle down your face I try to see what he is looking at instead. Then you are looking at me, but I can't see. "I didn't ask you for this, could I?" You look at me as you continue and say, "Do you want this?"</p> <p>I whimper a little, yes, of course, and I feel it in my heart. I want nothing less than to please you. "Say it, Master."</p> <p>"Mistress," you repeat and again I whimper. This time, your voice is more forceful, and I know that you're pleased. You release my breasts from your mouth and, moving back, start to work your fingers inside me. "Come here, slut, and make me cum. Do it."</p> <p>I don't dare. The tears are still flowing, but you know I am not a slave of yours anymore and you'll do what I want. At your command, I spread my legs fully wide and put my hands to my pussy. I start to rub at my pussy, hoping that you will be patient. I can feel you pulling on the leash and then tuging it toward me. Then you're guiding the leash into my pussy, and pulling hard. "Say it, little one. Say that you're an obedient, obedient little slut"</p> <p>"I'm an obedient, obedient little slut," I say, and I can tell you are pleased.</p> <p>"Good girl," you reply. "Now...please, may I cum, for youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
