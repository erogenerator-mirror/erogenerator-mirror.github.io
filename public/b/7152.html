He was really worried.</p> <p>"Oh, don't you worry. Now we can go. This might be fun!" She winked and grabbed his crotch. She gave his dick a tug, and a little smile formed. She had a very sexy grin. She looked at me, and said, "Don't you worry, sweet. You'll enjoy this a lot!"</p> <p>With that she started fondling his dick a little more. His dick was very hard, and I could already feel it's weight in my hand, as I started to get it to come up. She reached over to squeeze some pre-cum off of him in her hand, which she let go. She brought him straight to hardness. She rubbed his dick on the head of my finger. I gave it a playful squeeze. His dick got hard, and I could tell it was getting thicker as I played with it. I'm pretty sure I made him look, not make him think.</p> <p>She brought him to the point of bursting. She looked into his eyes as she gently rubbed himself along her finger in order to get him off. She continued to stroke.</p> <p>She took her lips off him for a moment to look at me. Oh my God, I was so turned on. She slowly stood up, and walked over to me. She kissed my lips gently, and told me she loved how it looked. She pulled me close again, and whispered.</p> <p>"I just want you to fuck me here on the bar. And on the floor of the hotel. I can't go there without knowing what's underneath. But, that doesn't mean I agree, ok?"</p> <p>I just gave her a nod and she turned away and headed over to the door, where we could watch the action. With my cock in hand, I followed her. I couldn't believe how hot she looked. She turned into the bar and I followed her. She was completely naked, and her head fell onto her folded arms. I couldn't wait to fuck her.</p> <p>The bar was small, and not quite all that large. We approached the table. I sat and she sat opposite me. I gave a glance to her. She looked cute, in that little black dress. She was just about to lift her shoulders. I reached towards my hand, and put a kiss on her cheekbone. She smiled at me cheekily. I kissed her left earlobe and whispered in her ear. She kissed it gently. I turned towards her and put some space on her left, and leaned over. I reached under her chin and brought her lip up and kissed my way to her neck. I nibbled on her earlobe, and she just melted. My cock was aching very hard. I leaned to her left, as I got to her left side, and lightly nuzzled and nibbled my way up. I moved to the edge of her gown, and she turned to watch and whisper to me.</p> <p>"Can you do that, Sweetheart? This might be fun," I asked.</p> <p>"Oh yes, Mike. Right here," she replied. "Just feel me as I'm doing this," she added.</p> <p>I pulled her robe to the side and put both of my hands on her left leg. I kept doing this very slowly, and it was feeling a lot pleasurable. I pulled her thigh to the side. I slid my hands all over her leg, and then pulled at her dress. I pulled down on her panties and pulled them down a little. The skin underneath was soft and pink on her skin. I saw her pussy for the first time, and it was very pale, I thought, and kind of pink, like hers. She spread her legs a little wider to give me better access. I kissed her right thigh and then got my mouth on her soft inner thigh. I kissed her lips and tasted the musky aroma of her pussy. I kissed her skin slowly, enjoying the feel of her soft flesh on my lips, nose and chin. She moaned and gasped for more attention. With one long licks I moved to her other thigh.</p> <p>The smell and feel of her pussy turned me on more than I had thought possible. And I knew what she wanted. I slowly moved my face to her panties and started to suck her pussy as I was pulling on her panties. I felt her moan with pleasure. I put two fingers into her pussy without taking my mouth away from my face. I started to kiss up to the middle of her thigh in a circular motion. I licked up her slit, then down along her slit again. I tasted her as I kissed the flesh around her pussy. I put myself fully onto her and started rubbing my dick up and down her pussy. Her pussy felt hot with my cock. She said I felt so warm inside, and it made me harder insideâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
