You see, I've been a big help to the other patients for a long time. I'd like to offer your services now, if that's what you'd like," she said.</p> <p>"If I was there, I'd welcome your help," he said.</p> <p>"Don't say I didn't help," she said as she got up. "Don't say I never got an opportunity to make myself at home."</p> <p>As she headed to the bathroom, she paused, took off her robe and left it on the floor. She felt silly, because she really wanted to take this all in; she just didn't think it would really come out. She knew it had. At the risk of losing her job, it would probably stay that way until she could find another position. She thought she was ready to start looking, and she would take the initiative. She went to her clothes drawer and found the black skirt, and a blue blouse. She put them on over the black silk blouse. She ran her hands through her hair and felt it fall in waves around her face. She looked at herself in the mirror, and she couldn't explain the feeling of vulnerability that overwhelmed her. She thought she might be willing to go for another day if the opportunity presented itself. It seemed like an eternity, and she wondered how she would feel like when she came back again, and he got up.</p> <p>"Ready?" was his answer.</p> <p>"I guess so," she said.</p> <p>"I'm not really going to leave my doctor until after you've had a turn," he said with a giggle.</p> <p>***</p> <p>"I really enjoyed the movie," she said as she sat down and the waiter left. "Thank you," she said with a smile.</p> <p>"Anytime," he said. "Would you be interested in ordering something special later this evening?"</p> <p>"Yes," she said. "How about right after I turn in?"</p> <p>He smiled and nodded. "That sounds great."</p> <p>He gave her a kiss on the cheek and the card he called his wallet. "See you soon."</p> <p>She got up to leave. "Not so fast," she said as she got out. "Before you get out I want you to pick another guy who isn't an asshole."</p> <p>***</p> <p>As soon as she got home and showered, she began trying to figure out why she had not gotten a chance to see him again so soon. She began by going through her closet and saw a couple of black leather jackets. Then she opened a door that led to her bedroom.</p> <p>A few seconds later she heard the doorbell ring and she heard the familiar sound of a man's voice inside the room. Her heart raced with excitement. She had no reason not to do it. She went to open the door, but she paused. He was standing there. He was dressed in gray slacks and a plain brown shirt with a blue button-down. His arms were crossed under his hat.</p> <p>He looked at her, then he looked at the jacket again. She smiled. "Hi," she said. "Do I know you?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"I guess we need to talk," she said with a smile, "and we need to see each other."</p> <p>"I guess I'm just going to stay here."</p> <p>She took a step forward and closed the door behind her, and he came forward and stepped into the room with her. They began kissing. He was still dressed in his suit jacket, but his tie and shirt hung on the other side. She could feel the material of his shirt rubbing against her bare leg as they kissed. They were kissing for a long time in silence. His hands were all over her clothing too. When she began feeling the bulge of his cock through the material of his slacks, he broke away from her and said, "Would you go change first?"</p> <p>She agreed and headed to the bathroom to change. While she changed she tried to imagine what he was thinking of her as she dressed. He had told her to go buy his coat that he had something special for her. She had been thinking about it for a good half hour before she had decided. She slipped off her coat and handed it to him. He gave her the coat in a tight but sexy style. "Thank you," he said.</p> <p>She smiled. "For what?"</p> <p>"For being what I'm doing, and for all your help."</p> <p>She took the coat from him and sat down on the toilet. She looked at herself in the mirror. She put on the coat and felt the fabric of his suit against her shoulders. She looked again. There was a large bulge in his trousers, pushing outward from his crotch.
