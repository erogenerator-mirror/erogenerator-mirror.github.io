I asked.</p> <p>"I'll tell you in a sec."</p> <p>I followed the trail as it led northward, following that area until I found a small cave. A couple of feet later we followed a couple of narrow wooden steps. I entered a small room. It was brightly lit with a few candles scattered around by small pots and a lamp. A small table had lighted tables and chairs. Most of the room was filled with a number of various things, including a small couch and a bench, a large wooden chair and a small mirror. Several wooden cuffs were placed on the wall in the middle of the room beside a large coffee table.</p> <p>A small square toilet sat between the table and the mirror. A heavy chain was secured around my hand so I pulled it free when it hurt. It was the same kind of chain that had hooked up through the ceiling so I had to walk down into the room. The bathroom was large, with a large shower stall, a bidet and a small hot tub. I was thankful that, as I said, it provided access to both sides. I wasn't as surprised, however, to see a toilet in my own bedroom. To add to the surprise, the toilet was completely enclosed by a long steel ring. This ring could easily be used to urinate.</p> <p>I stepped off the stone steps and into the bath to begin my ablution.</p> <p>When I returned the robe was off completely. It felt warm even in the cool room. The water was hot but not cold. I stood beside the tub and began to sooth the welts that formed on my body from the spanking I received. While I was doing this I thought about the events of that week. There was a lot. For the start I was a cauldron. It seemed that I couldn't get enough. After an hour, I realized that I could get very wet very quickly. I started out by washing my breasts, then washing my stomach and legs. I couldn't believe how wet it felt. After toweling and dry, I climbed into the tub to continue. As I lay back under the streaming water and began to massage my breast, I thought about the pain I had received last Thursday and Friday. It was so erotic that I couldn't hold back my climax. I had always enjoyed being able to release while having an orgasm like that.</p> <p>I rolled into a sitting position and began to get out of the tub, noticing that there was soap under the water and clothes on the floor. Turning on the TV I found that there were a few magazines on the computer tray next to the tub. I clicked to the first magazine and read about the upcoming sex game. It was about 2 couples in a room all naked and enjoying each other. One guy sucked and fucked another with a huge black rubber cock. The next guys sucked the cock of another guy who was being fucked by their partner.</p> <p>I looked briefly at the clock on the wall and was astonished by how fast it was getting dark. The clock read 6:53 PM. I was hoping that I hadn't gotten the time wrong but the thought of the movie in the closet came back to my mind. I got out my vibrator and started to use it before I got dressed.</p> <p>Once into my bedroom, I began to undress and went to the closet door. I picked out a few things I thought I would wear for the game.</p> <p>I had bought a strap-on for the day. This was the strap-on that I had bought in the closet at a local adult toy store on Monday after I had bought the two items. They did not appear in my size when I went to bed the night before. The night before had been incredible. My orgasms were so intense that I had to lie down on my side and masturbate in the closet before I was able to wear a strap-on. I had just finished. If that was what I had planned for the game, I couldn't wait any longer.</p> <p>I had a few choices of stockings. After deciding on a pair of white lacy stockings, I picked up an elastic waistband and attached it to my waistband. That done, I put on the thong that I had learned to keep me clean. I had only chosen to wear a skirt and a loose fitting camisole when showering with others, as most of the time I was wearing a bra. Now it appeared as if I was going to have to take it off for the game this evening.</p> <p>I opened the closet door and found that there was a stack of clothes folded beside the bed. When I reached out to pick them up, I found the next items that I had not even imagined. There was a large metal collar that I had placed on my neck the day before (one of those nipple chains I had bought from a good toy store that had a chain hanging fromâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
