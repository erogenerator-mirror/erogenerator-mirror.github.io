"There's a lot of things I want to try." She smiled at me. "But I want to do it on my own." She didn't look up, I expected but instead she turned on her high stiletto heels toward me and slowly pulled the shirt up over her head, revealing the lacy black bra underneath.</p> <p>"Wow, you're gorgeous," I said softly, staring. I think I said it about all the times she'd flashed me on our first date, but her breasts were huge for her frame. They were the size of a basketball and they jiggled with every breath. She put her hands on her hips and looked down at me. "I've got a great body from a distance," she said, a smile forming on her lovely mouth. Her eyes were closed and she was smiling. She slowly ran her hands over the soft fabric covering her chest and her nipples hardened. "This is so sexy," she said. "This is so wrong," she said, pushing her bra down. "I feel terrible," she lamented, looking at me with her arms crossed around her body as she unhooked her bra.</p> <p>"I know," I said, grabbing a couple of towels and towel off the side of the pool and throwing them on the blanket, "I should not be naked when I'm with you." We had to get out of there before the first waves started.</p> <p>She giggled. "It really is the perfect situation to have a relationship with you," she said with a cheeky smile as she stepped into my arms and kissed me. "I think I'll have to do something to make this better for you too," she said, stepping up and wrapping her arms around my waist from behind, looking back up at me with a glistening smile, "if you don't mind."</p> <p>"Why would I mind?" I asked back. I could feel her breasts pressing hard against me and I suddenly became excited. I pulled her close, feeling a thrill of excitement as she pressed herself against me. I had hoped I could kiss her on the lips but that wasn't to be.</p> <p>"Because I want to do it again," she whispered. She gave my neck a little tweak and it felt like electricity ran through my body as she bit at me, her hand sliding down along her side, down over her stomach. Her hand went up her body and I could feel her skin trembling under that delicate touch. She pulled me tighter against her and moved her other hand between our bodies, resting two hands on her stomach and gently moving them along my inner thighs. I was becoming aroused despite myself.</p> <p>"I want to do that again," I told her softly.</p> <p>"Do it?" She said quietly, her breath coming out even harder as she kissed me. "Just say it."</p> <p>"Do what?" I asked, pulling her close and feeling my cock starting to bulge against her. My own cock was rock hard and she could feel it pressing against her thigh.</p> <p>"I want you to go down on me," she whispered. I looked down at her and grinned, "I'm a man of my word," she said, moving her hands to my back and lifting me up, sitting me on the edge of the raft with her at my side.</p> <p>She slid my shorts down, revealing my boxer briefs, then pulled away completely, letting my erection come free. She pulled her panties down and the small triangle of hair above her pussy exposed itself to my eyes for the first time and she gave a small giggle, pushing herself away from me with a laugh. It looked so sexy. I smiled and she walked over to where I leaned back and sat down on my legs, my cock twitching. She took my cock in one hand and looked down at it and ran both hands up and down over it, from my balls up to around it. I was getting ready to say something but she shook her head. "You promised," she said, looking up at me with wide eyes.</p> <p>"I'm all yours," I reassured her as I wrapped my arms around her, my hands working up and down her body, squeezing and massaging her in ways she'd never experienced before. Her eyes were bright with excitement and she moved her legs to wrap around mine, locking me in.</p> <p>I could almost feel the weight of her and when I felt her warm breath upon my cock I couldn't hold it back any longer. She took it in her mouth and took me into her and sucked and licked me with a frenzy, swirling her tongue around and around my sensitive head. It didn't take long before I felt my juices running down her cheek and I knew I would not last long.</p> <p>I reached out to her hips and held them as her tongue slid down me, back up.
