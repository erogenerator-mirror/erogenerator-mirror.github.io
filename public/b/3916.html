"But first you have to put this on."</p> <p>Dee bit her lip in anticipation of the humiliation of being undressed and in her own home, but there didn't seem to be any choice in her mind, if there appeared to be any of them. Then again, maybe there was. Then again, she'd been so sure that Jack was the one in control of this entire event that she'd given him the green light before it began. It was very clear in this instance. Jack had her on his lap, and while he had a full view of her body and the fact that she was naked, they were both aware that she was completely helpless, not daring to move. Not only that, she was totally and totally vulnerable and at his mercy. It almost made little sense to her.</p> <p>There could be no way that Jack could know that she was actually in this situation, that he was in control or at least trying to, but it was quite obvious she was in full possession of both of them. They hadn't even started undressing at the last second, and Jack started to lead her by the hand. That part of her was left out all together. What did he want her to do exactly? Was she to lie on his lap, on her stomach, with her body between them as he did it? Or would he simply use it to lead her somewhere else, to put his hands where the hand was? He was really going to be very careful about things, very careful indeed.</p> <p>Jack didn't have to wait far to find out. As he led her closer to his chair, Dee opened herself to him as best she could. This position definitely let him feel more vulnerable to this. And there was no doubt that he could have her anywhere at any moment. He also didn't have to be patient any longer.</p> <p>He let her slide to the floor and began taking off her sandals. She did as she was told, and they were quickly discarded in his hands from her toes to her ankles. While he was doing that now, Dee's skirt went up a bit, so that there was a good amount of bare flesh showing. Not just on her thighs or hips, but most of her inner thighs, right back. That just meant that his fingers would reach her clit, if it wouldn't make her happy. She had one foot to go and a good portion of her ass was exposed. The bottom of her cheeks. She was wearing nothing but a pair of thin white panties, which as he soon discovered just couldn't cover her tiny slit.</p> <p>He continued to gently pull the white panties down, and the little black leather high-heels kept clinging to the edges of her butt, but they kept slipping up onto her bare skin, a thin piece that would have slipped over any other part of her body. Her cheeks were so beautiful as to be completely exposed above her little panties, and they were a bright crimson, the thin leather looking like an embossed star. That last piece of clothing was one of the most gorgeous pieces of herself that he had ever seen. The skirt portion hung from her body with just a thin band of cloth covering and just covering her skin. It had a strip of cloth that barely covered her crotch, and as Jack slid it over the small piece of cloth covered her private parts she was sure it had a mind of it's own. Jack's fingers lightly touched her lips, and her body instinctively spread her legs to greet him. Her pussy was still tingling.</p> <p>"I wonder if that's where the other shoes, socks and panties came from?"</p> <p>"Yes, thank you, sir," Dee replied. She was still a bit breathless, however. Maybe it was just an involuntary response to the humiliating situation.</p> <p>Jack had Dee sit on the edge of his chair and then slowly began kneading her feet, starting at the toes of her right foot on her right first. All the while, still keeping her eyes lowered, she watched him as he slid her foot up and down over and over again. She was watching him as he did this as if it were the most natural thing to do. Her body was reacting to his, and she could only imagine if there was anyone in the world at all doing the same.</p> <p>Once that foot was fully up, Jack got up, took his shoes off and sat on the floor, facing her feet up toward him. As she took the opportunity to gaze down, her face was level with his crotch. She was able to see some faint outline of his cock, but she could tell that it was hard, but she would never guess that it wasn't so big. There was so much leg being exposed by that piece of cloth. With her face so close to his crotch her breath felt theâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
