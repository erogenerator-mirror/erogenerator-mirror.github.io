I tried not to stare.</p> <p>"I've just been thinking about how much you've changed. And, now that you're back, this whole thing with you was going to be a hell of a lot easier..."</p> <p>I blushed. My hands were still in my lap as I realized what that really was. He had taken my virginity. I couldn't do that again. It's just that one day, without a doubt, I'd wake up with this overwhelming feeling of guilt, and it'd be like my whole life ruined, and it was that day, with your boyfriend, that it was like that moment, when you became his.</p> <p>"Hey," I managed to say.</p> <p>"No, we'll talk about it tomorrow."</p> <p>"You're just so cute."</p> <p>"No, I'm just a kid." He smiled. "Come on up and get some breakfast. I'm tired and I've got things to do today."</p> <p>"Okay," I shrugged, and I was going upstairs to try to forget this whole thing. It was going to be hard.</p> <p>I was up early. I didn't really need to spend too much time downstairs this morning, since it's just been such a weird, horrible dream after all this time, and my boyfriend is gone, and my boyfriend is a very beautiful woman.</p> <p>I put on some clothes. It was just a short skirt and a halter-top, but it was nice. It showed off my tan and made my skin shine. It's not like it's all-over tan because I don't have a lot of it. I had the most lovely long strawberry blonde hair down low, and it was just the closest hair I could think of.</p> <p>I put my purse on the kitchen table. I went and took the coffee out and had a cup in my hand. I got a mug and sat it down. I looked around and saw it was empty, and then realized I didn't want to wake him, so I got up and went to the bathroom. I came back out. He was propped up in bed with one arm across his eyes, and a sheet drawn up just to a spot above his butt. He must have snored for a few moments.</p> <p>I took a big sip of coffee, and I looked around the room. It seemed to be somewhere I'd never been before. It smelled of pine scented shampoo, some kind of herbal tea. I could just make out a few boxes, and a few old clothes. He had a box of cigarettes and a few old, broken-out magazines on a shelf. I felt a little sick to my stomach.</p> <p>"Babe?" he said. His voice was a bit hoarse and tired. "What's the matter with you? I thought it was nice to finally wake up."</p> <p>I nodded. I knew the morning had been tough. It felt like I'd been there for a while now, and I didn't want this to be over. I could feel that I hadn't slept well and couldn't even concentrate on anything anymore.</p> <p>I sighed, and took another big sip of the hot liquid in my coffee mug.</p> <p>"Hey," I said.</p> <p>"Yeah?"</p> <p>The sheets shifted underneath him. I stared. It was just so hard to look in those eyes. I saw them glittering in their yellow and pinks as he turned around.</p> <p>"You don't need to be angry," I said. He stared back. "I'm sorry."</p> <p>"It's okay to feel sorry," he said. He reached down and touched my hand. "It's not that you shouldn't be, it's just that it really... hurts. And I just wanted to ask how you're doing."</p> <p>"I'm okay," I sniffed. "I was just... kind of exhausted."</p> <p>"Not bad, huh?" he shrugged. "Are you sore? Or do you really want to go back to..."</p> <p>I sighed. "Yeah, it's just been so hard."</p> <p>"Really? It really was hard?" he put a hand on top of mine.</p> <p>"Yeah," I laughed.</p> <p>"Babe," he said again, his tone light, and I started to smile. "It's kind of been really stressful for you. I know... I have to tell you something, you're the first person that I've been in my life since you were a child and I've been trying hard but... my heart is still broken. It hasn't even started to heal yet, but I'm not in a situation where I can't make the time. And the stress would be much worse."</p> <p>I felt tears welling in my eyes again. What's gotten into me, I thought? I've been like thisâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
