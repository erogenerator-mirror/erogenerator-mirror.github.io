I called in response to the unlisted number. I knew the place because it was where the place was, and in my mind it had to be me.</p> <p>"I've never been there and I hate the time I spend just trying to keep up with my friends and my mommy."</p> <p>"Oh honey, you can't go on with your mommy. I was going to tell you to go ahead and join me." I told her, and she nodded.</p> <p>I left the building without making my way past the security desk to the entrance to the pub. I walked up to the bar with my two mugs of beer and turned my attention back to a tall beautiful black man with salt-and-pepper hair that seemed to be stuck to his forehead, and deep blue eyes. His name was Tony and I was trying to remember the last name because he came as a total mystery to me. We started off small because he was one of the few people in my town that was a guy. That and he was single, so in order for me to really understand a guy, I had to know a little more about him.</p> <p>He was well muscled and he was sitting in the booth across from me, which was probably the most interesting part. From what I thought, he was at least forty or more years old and probably had the looks and looks of the black studs of the porn industry. He was still the most outgoing person I had ever encountered, but I hadn't thought about him in such a way that I was afraid that I didn't fit into the category of guy that he was attracted to. Even now after I had been alone in the place for the past two hours, I was beginning to think of me as just a friend that he could confide in, and I didn't want to become a regular patron there.</p> <p>"So what do you drink?" he asked as he stood from his chair and poured a glass of beer.</p> <p>"Just whiskey" I responded, and sat down beside him.</p> <p>"You look like you could use one." He turned to Tony and said, "Hey, I don't drink."</p> <p>"No, I really don't. I work in a real estate firm downtown, and it's my second job." My boss Tony looked over at the man, and nodded.</p> <p>"Tony, what do you do?" Tony asked in a tone that I was beginning to like. He looked older than my fifty years.</p> <p>"I'm an insurance salesman."</p> <p>"Well, it sounds good at this company. But what are you into?" Tony asked, and took a sip of his drink.</p> <p>"I'm a little of both. And I guess they don't sell home movies either." I said with a smile. I really couldn't believe that I actually talked to him, let alone that we were actually in a bar.</p> <p>"I'll take that as a compliment. It is not as if I don't get hit on at the office, you know." He replied. "You're really pretty, Tony. I would love to see more of you, but the office will be closed by now."</p> <p>Tony took a couple of sips of his beer, and then picked up his empty glass and motioned over to a table in the corner of the bar. "So, where are you staying?" he asked, and got up.</p> <p>"The Hotel, and the Café are both in the top floor. Do you want to go?" I was feeling a little awkward asking that question and was surprised that it didn't bother you or that my boss sounded like he was a decent guy.</p> <p>He laughed a little nervously, "Sure, that would be great! What sort of a massage would you like?" he asked, and I could tell that he was nervous because of the size of the bulge that was pushing against his t-shirt and jeans.</p> <p>The Café was about four blocks away and after we started walking, I leaned against the counter as he was looking for a massage oil. We got to an old abandoned building located on the edge of an industrial lot and he took out a tube of KY jelly from a desk drawer and started to rub his hands into and around my exposed shoulders. I thought about asking him to use it, but decided to keep quiet. I knew the drill that he was going to use, and if he did it right, I would be okay with the whole thing. That is, if he had just asked.</p> <p>"So, tell me a little about yourself." He said as his hands moved lower and lower. "If you don't mind, if would you be able to use some of this on me?"</p> <p>"That would be great. I'll be happy to massage your shoulders. You know, I never have massage clients come to my hotel and come with—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
