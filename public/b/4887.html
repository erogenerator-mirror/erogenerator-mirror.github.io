If I did tell him I wasn't going to do anything, he'd think I made a mistake. It would make us feel like cheating, he said.</p> <p>He said he knew he'd better go get her on the couch and wait for me to come back. He had her on her back in seconds and was sucking on her tits while he was fucking her mouth. Finally, he said that he was about to cum, so I got up on the floor and got behind her. When he started to slide back into her it was like he was pulling a gasket. I didn't want him cumming hard though, so I pulled it out and told her to get on the floor. She went back down on his cock and I put my dick up in her mouth and told her to lick the cum off it, and I moved out and watched as she sucked him off.</p> <p>I was close, but I couldn't do it. Not really, but I wanted to watch my wife suck the cum out of another man. I saw the disappointment in her face. I thought what a bad husband I'd never be able to be again, but with all his money he's got the balls to tell me that. She's really into it, I thought to myself. She just wants to please me and enjoy me.</p> <p>He grabbed her hair from behind and pulled her up for a wild animal face fuck, and while doing that I could tell that he wasn't as good as he used to be. I got a couple of shots of his sperm at the side of her pretty lips and when I thought he was done, I pulled him off the bed and threw him on his back. I wanted to make him cum fast. He needed to cum before I could. As excited as I was at feeling the same thing I wanted to watch him cum a little. I wanted him to see and feel and then do it with me.</p> <p>It was so hot to get him to do it, knowing that for me he was cheating and I was his. When he finally finished I was so ready to watch when I put my cock inside her. I'd been so intent on having her I'd completely forgotten what was happening in the bedroom. He pulled off and came all over her face, and when she looked up at me, I'd shot my load in his face, right onto her face. It looked so good on her, she looked so beautiful with a smile on her face.</p> <p>As soon as I finished, he sat up, pulled some Kleenex from the top of the side table, and wiped off his cock. It wasn't bad. He had to use only his mouth because of his gag reflex, but it was the first time he'd ever done that.</p> <p>When he sat up she didn't say anything. I leaned over and kissed him and pushed him back down. He got up and got some wipes from the table and cleaned me off myself. When he left the room, I knew that what we'd had was all wrong, but I couldn't blame him.</p> <p>When he came back at about that time, I told him that if he wasn't here, he would have a hard on that would be even bigger than it had been.</p> <p>He told me to go take a shower and get ready for dinner. When I got up he pulled me towards his room and locked his bedroom door and left. I couldn't help but look at his bulge as he walked away and wondered what he'd done to deserve everything he was about to do.</p> <p>To be continuedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
