We got off of the truck and sat around for a while talking. I told her that I wanted to stop at a hardware store and pick up some things that we both liked. I asked her if she wanted to stop at one of the local hardware stores. She said with me was a store that dealt in old leather goods and was in a much better section in town. It had a little arcade, book shelf, the garage for the junk and then she led me down the street. I went to a store and picked up a few books of old leather goods. She said we should go into the adult book store while it was open. I was looking forward to doing this for the next few days. She went through the store, picked some things up and brought them back to the truck, put them in my truck, and we were off.</p> <p>We went into the small store and got some items to try. We both tried a few items and she tried another. After we had all the things looked at, we went back to the truck and got back in. We talked as the truck warmed up. I showed her how easy this was going to be. I told her that after a few trips back up this section of town, we should come back to that bookstore. She said that I could keep the money. I agreed with her. We drove up the street to the house we just got off of, went inside and knocked on the door. There was a light on in there and we got in the truck. I turned on the light under the door to make sure it was unlocked. There wasn't. We drove into the house and she knocked on the door again. There was a light on in the bedroom. When I unlocked the door and opened the door, Mary was there, lying on the bed naked except for what little of her clothing she had on. She pulled the covers back off of her body. I took Mary by the hand and led her back into the bedroom. I shut and locked the door, set down on my bed and held her hand. She looked at my arms and told me, "I did this to myself."</p> <p>"I never really thought that I was getting involved with you or your husband. I am glad that I have someone here to stay. I am sure that I will be staying with you."</p> <p>"I'll be spending the majority of my time here at home. I just don't know how."</p> <p>"We'll have to find something out of this, I am just not sure if we should be together if there is nothing else to discuss. As long as you are here I don't worry about anything. If you find I don't want you to see me alone it won't bother you." I told her as I gently touched her shoulders down to her shoulders.</p> <p>Mary relaxed her arms holding them and looked up at me and smiled. "I think you're right. I will be here for you most of the time," she told me. She looked up at me when I put my arms around her again. I put my arms back around her and held her. We just held each other a little while before I kissed her lightly on the forehead and she said, "I'm sorry I had to let you do this to me."</p> <p>"Mary it's alright."</p> <p>"It's a lot different that I thought it would be, and even if it is not, it is going to come back to us. It will make both of us happier than we have been for a while now."</p> <p>"I know. You were with someone. Your own son."</p> <p>Mary looked at the floor and smiled. "You know what I think?" she said smiling at me.</p> <p>"Honey, I would think I'm the only man you've ever felt that way." I told her.</p> <p>"Yes I do. And just how many times do you think we should hear each other about this?"</p> <p>"I was with you many times in high school, and it was exciting to talk to you about it. We have talked more about a number of situations where a girl was concerned, and while it didn't happen, it was still exciting."</p> <p>"It was exciting, but did it bother you when our dad was around?"</p> <p>"I know he was with you more than I was. Just not what I was thinking. He was not exactly a nice guy either."</p> <p>Just as I was about to say that, I said, "Mary, remember that our dad never knew about that. We didn't tell him about it."</p> <p>"I'll remember that too," she told me. "I just did. I thought that it was all kind of coming out."</p> <p>"You and I both did," I told her. "I never thought that a girl would talk that way to me.</p> <p>"When I would get toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
