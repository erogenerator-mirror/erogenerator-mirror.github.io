That's okay." She slid her hand under my legs and began rubbing the inside of my thighs, moving from my toes to just above my knees.</p> <p>Her touch had me going completely over the edge, and I knew that I could hold out a little longer if she continued. I raised my hips and pulled them up until I was standing straight up with my back to her. My cock was straining in my pajama bottoms and I could feel her fingertips brushing against me through the thin fabric. The feeling of her fingers massaging my balls was bringing me close to the edge again, and I lifted one thigh higher, spreading my legs farther apart. I looked down to see the top of my cock glistening with my pre-cum, as if my body had been strung out by the strings tied around it, and I could feel her hand rubbing softly over the top of my dick.</p> <p>I looked at her and asked her, "Are you sure this is okay with you?"</p> <p>The feeling of her fingers stroking between my legs, and moving so deliberately over my dick like I was getting close to popping to tell me what it was she was going to do was sending me over the edge. I put my hand over hers and held it motionless next to my dick. I felt her hand move up to my chest to grab the zipper at the bottom of my pj's and pulled the zipper open. Her fingers reached inside and my head sprang free. She pulled my underwear down and helped me step out of them. I had a very hard penis now, pointing straight up at the ceiling, and she ran the rough denim down from over the top to over the head.</p> <p>The skin was smooth and warm, the tip cool and silky. She looked at me with a devilish grin, and reached up to rub her fingers over the tip of my dick, which was throbbing even more now. She slowly ran her hand back down the shaft then up to my balls, and she began twisting her wrist in a figure eight, as she stroked up and down. The feeling was incredible, as her hand went up to the head, then down just to my balls. All the while, she kept rubbing up and down my dick with her other hand. Her palm, still slick from cuming inside her fist, was wrapped tightly around my shaft. As her fingers worked me over, she kept rubbing her hips against my thighs, grinding her pussy against my thigh as she continued watching me. I had never enjoyed what she was able to do, but I felt extremely aroused as her hand expertly stroked over my penis.</p> <p>When she was just stroking the head, she cupped her breasts in her hands, and leaned forward to kiss me, slipping her tongue into my mouth. When she pulled away, she whispered into my ear, "If you were here in my bed again, you wouldn't be thinking of me while I'm stroking you." Her hand continued to pump on me, and I could feel the tension building in my testicles, which I was afraid they might explode. "I was thinking of you as my lover tonight." She whispered into my ear, "Wouldn't you love to have a chance to make love to me...to...fuck me?"</p> <p>My eyes went wide with shock and curiosity. She knew from that moment on, I hadn't been able to do anything with anyone else, and it had never happened to me until now. She knew I had never been a girl's first. I knew that it could not be the only way. Just the idea that this sexy little girl wanted to be a woman made my dick twitch again, just a little harder. I looked down to see her hand pump up and down, and a small bead of pre-cum was hanging from my dick. "Uh...uh...don't let it leak," I said. But I didn't stop her.</p> <p>She giggled, "Are you sure you don't mind, lover?" The thought of her doing this to me made my heart pound. The thought of her making me wear the little string that was tied around my cock made my heart beat like crazy. "Don't get your hopes up lover, I really want to make you feel good...that was my gift to you" she said. I think my face screwed up in a goofy smile, but the thought of her in that position pushed me over the top again. As she kept pumping up and down on my dick, she leaned back into the bed in front of me, and then dropped her legs until they were both lying flat on the bed. She took one of my hands with her free hand, and pulled it down to her crotch, where she spread her legs as wide as they would go. She was dripping wet, and the smell of her arousal was strong, as if she were really turned on to the idea of being aâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
