She continued to squirm and moan. I lifted her legs back up as far as they would go. I looked up. What I saw made my heart skip a beat, her pussy was literally just above my face. Her lips were swollen and her clit was sticking out almost an inch from it. I could smell her arousal as I got closer to her.</p> <p>Her legs were shaking and she looked like she might pass out. I dove right in.</p> <p>"Oh God." She moaned as she tasted herself on my tongue. I looked up to see her body shaking and tremble a little more every second.</p> <p>I pulled back, licking as she squirmed, making her knees even stronger.</p> <p>"Oh no you don't." She scolded me, "I need you now."</p> <p>I moved quickly up her body again and leaned down to kiss her. She grabbed my hair hard and held my head as close to her as she could. We kissed hard. It didn't seem to work, but we tried. Her hands left my head as I pulled back, a little disappointed when I got only the lips of my cock inside of her.</p> <p>She smiled and rubbed me up and down. "Fuck me." She said it again as I could feel her lips press up against the shaft of my shaft, as my cock slid into her. She wrapped her legs around me and pulled me tight to her as I thrust forward, almost pushing my cock all the way deep into her pussy. It was so hot!</p> <p>"Harder." She commanded. I continued to thrust hard into her as she moaned and grabbed my arm. My cock was completely buried in her as we both moaned and moved together. I could feel her pussy squeezing on my shaft as it slid back and forth.</p> <p>"Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh God!" She moaned and gripped my arm hard again. I was holding on as hard as I could to keep from cumming too soon. I leaned down and kissed her again as I thrust my cock in and out of her.</p> <p>She pulled my face to hers as she kissed me and whispered, "Tell me when you're close."</p> <p>"I'm going to do it now. I'll do you right..." I pulled my hand quickly away from my cock and grabbed her waist. I lifted her body so her pussy lips were right on top of my head again as I thrust my full seven inches as far as I could go into her now.</p> <p>"Oh." She kissed me as I thrust myself into her pussy. She could feel herself tightening around my cock and I could feel her pussy begin to spasm around my cock. She moaned and grabbed my arm. The harder I thrust into her the louder she moaned. "Oh! Oh!" She whispered into my ear, "I'm going to cum." I was shocked by what she said, but I pushed hard into her one last time as she started to cum. I thrust into her one last time and pressed my cock hard against her pussy as she held onto my arm, making sure I didn't just fuck her.</p> <p>Her body tensed up as she came and the room filled completely with the sound of our moans. My cock began to spasm and I felt myself throb and throb inside of her.</p> <p>She pulled me tight to her, our lips locked.</p> <p>"That was intense." She smiled at me. She pulled me back a little as her body relaxed. I put my arm around her waist and held onto her tightly as she breathed heavily and lay her head on my shoulder. I lay my head on her right shoulder for a second, trying to catch my breath.</p> <p>We kissed for a minute or two before I reached over and grabbed a small hand towel. I wiped her pussy gently.</p> <p>She looked at me before she looked at the clock. "I have to go take a shower."</p> <p>"Okay, do you still have time?" I asked, feeling a slight surge of arousal. She nodded and got up.</p> <p>As I watched her walk toward the bathroom door and I waited for her to turn toward me, I wondered if she meant the evening would end as it did too. She didn't.</p> <p>As I was getting dressed, I decided to head back down to the pool. As I headed down the hallway toward my room, my erection had subsided and I sat down on the bench. I closed my eyes as I thought of what it would look like when my cock finally went soft. And I felt a little guilty.</p> <p>After another couple of minutes, I heard the sound of the shower stop. My mind raced. Was she actually going to just walk out of the shower and grab a towel? She was naked as she dried her hair and I would have been so mad, but all I could think about was the vision of her naked body as sheâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
