"So good."</p> <p>"So beautiful, baby," he breathed into her ear, and then began massaging the inside of her thighs and rubbing the inside of her upper thighs. "So beautiful..."</p> <p>"Mmm!" she purred. As he moved between her legs she spread her legs wide for him and he slipped his fingers into her pussy lips, making her moan. "You are so beautiful," he breathed. He moved his fingers to her clit, and began to rub it lightly.</p> <p>All three of them moaned and panted for a while as he began to rub her clit faster, pressing his lips against hers and kissing her softly, while his hands roamed her body, stroking her skin and pinching her nipples.</p> <p>"Mmm, please, no. Not again," he begged her weakly, and with her hands still on his thighs he continued to stroke, pressing her clit to increase her pleasure.</p> <p>"Mmm," she kissed him, her tongue darting in his mouth before it met his. "No!" she whimpered, breaking off the kiss but not stopping the motion of the hand on her clit. "No, please, don't stop."</p> <p>With a grin, he kissed her and began to finger her again.</p> <p>"Mmm," she purred, still in a state of arousal. "Oh, yes, please..."</p> <p>He began to fuck her, stroking her clit between his fingers as his lips kissed her. The tip of his tongue circled the sensitive pink nub and she moaned. "Please, baby. Please put your fingers where you like. Oh, yes, finger my pussy, rub my clit.... Mmm."</p> <p>At his touch, she began to shake and he took a free hand to pull her legs to his shoulders, letting her rest them there.</p> <p>"No! Don't," she pleaded. "Please, don't make me wait. Please don't make me wait."</p> <p>"Please?" he whispered, as he kissed her neck. "Want to make me wait?"</p> <p>She groaned and her body tensed for a second, as if she was being caught in a moment of madness.</p> <p>"Don't make me wait. Please. Please, please, do this."</p> <p>At her words, he leaned forward, his lips brushing hers again as he slipped his fingers to her clit. "Ah! Yes," she groaned, pressing hard against his mouth, as his fingers rubbed her sensitive nub.</p> <p>It was the first time he had touched her pussy, and she groaned as he sucked on her neck again. "Fuck, please..." he pleaded. Her mouth opened and she kissed him.</p> <p>"Please, baby! Please," she whispered. "Please, don't make me wait."</p> <p>"I'll make you wait," he whispered back, as he pressed his lips to hers. "I'll make you all good things again, baby."</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>When Jack woke up the next day, the room was dark. He had no idea where he was. His eyes were blurry, and his vision was blurry.</p> <p>When he came to, he was lying on his back as his alarm clock read six in the morning and his face was covered in blue and black. Jack had no idea of where he was, or who he was with, or what could be happening. He realized as he realized, he wasn't naked. Where he was and his friends, there was no time for any details. He groaned. He turned toward the door. It opened, and he was alone. He heard the shower running, and he looked around to make sure he was in the room when he heard a rustle of fabric around to his left.</p> <p>"Jack?" the voice called out to him. It was his mother. "Jack, wake up," she whispered, stroking his body. He tried to sit up again, and stumbled to the hallway. "Jack," she repeated, pulling the covers over his head and rubbing his back.</p> <p>He felt his legs touch the sides of his bed. With a groan, he stood up and quickly wrapped his robe around his body and began dressing.</p> <p>"Jack?" he called out. The voice on the other end of the line sounded frantic. "Mom?"</p> <p>"Mmm? Jack, wake up. What's wrong? Are you feeling better?" she asked as she held him over with her shoulder.</p> <p>"I think so," he said, and sat up to turn on his back. The sheets were pulled down to his waist. "I feel so... soâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
