A very sexy grin spread over her face, and she blushed and smiled, "Or would you prefer to simply let me go in there?"</p> <p>"No!" I laughed, "I don't see where you'll want to make a scene, would you? I mean it's your fault we're in this mess."</p> <p>"Oh really, is it? Are you really sure about this, or is it all my fault?" she asked.</p> <p>"It's all my fault? Of course, it's my fault... I let..." I started to ask myself, but I knew that she was right, and if this worked out and she really, really liked me, then just let me go. I just wasn't sure about how she felt about it. If she were going to go along, so be it.</p> <p>"Oh, is everyone going to let you come or not?" asked the DJ.</p> <p>"All three of us will," I agreed, "but it's a first! Don't you worry too much, my little girl!"</p> <p>Then the girls got up walked over the bar, "Are you sure we can swing by when we get back?" asked the DJ. All laughed and headed off to their separate rooms.</p> <p>"I think it may be best for us to finish our drinks before going," I said, "You get to go with us and we can get to the dance floor."</p> <p>"Oh, are you sure it's safe? Maybe I should give them a break and call it quits," she joked, pointing to where my drink was and a bottle of Patron against them. "Or maybe I should," she added grinning, "Maybe you should just finish that drink off and hit the dance floor before we go?"</p> <p>Before I could respond she was moving towards the middle of the dance floor, and the DJ had turned up the music and the volume a little. She was swaying to the beat and dancing as gracefully as she could. She looked over her shoulder and smiled, "I'm yours!"</p> <p>"Oh, you're going to dance with me to the hottest piece of tail I've ever danced with," said her boyfriend.</p> <p>"Maybe we'll both do it," she smiled, "Or..." her words trailed off as she looked around the dance floor for a good moment, before looking back at me to make eye contact. Then she raised her glass and slowly walked towards me. She gave me a quick kiss on the cheek and turned into my arms, leaving only a small opening for me to reach out with my other hand. She wrapped her arms around me and leaned in for another kiss. Our two wet bodies pressing tight against each other gave away the passion we had been feeling for the past hour. I felt a little silly, but I liked this girl all too much.</p> <p>"Do you like being with me?" she asked as we kissed, "Maybe I can kiss you back for sure!" she squeezed and massaged my neck as I ran my hands up and down her back.</p> <p>Then I started running my hands down her back just a little way and slipped it right up the back of the dress I was wearing. The thin strap of her halter top caught mid-air as I ran my hands upward, just an inch or two. Her arms tightened around my neck and I leaned back into her as she felt the silkiness of her dress against her skin. We kissed again and I ran my hands over her breasts. She sighed and ran her hands all over my back once again, but this time she didn't stop me from feeling the sides of her breasts, and then down between them.</p> <p>"Mmm, yes, I like the way you feel," she said. "Just like this," she slipped her tongue into my mouth and we kissed again, but even more intense this time. I could feel her excitement as I played with her nipples, and they instantly got a little hard. She pulled my face down between her breasts and I looked up and she kissed me again, deeply. She was kissing me back with more passion than what she had just kissed all night. This time when the kiss finished, she didn't let go of me. She cupped the bottom of her breasts in her hands and began squeezing them together.</p> <p>"I like that," she said. "Mmm, I love that," she said to the bartender. "I think I'll need a little special treatment."</p> <p>"Oh, I love special treatment," the bartender answered as he stood up and walked towards us. He put his hands in his pockets and walked to the counter, "Just one more to drink and that'll be it forâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
