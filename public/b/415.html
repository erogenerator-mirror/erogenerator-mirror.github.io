You are so hot, baby! You’re making me crazy!” I moaned, and reached my fingers up to squeeze her breasts as she continued to writhe beneath me, grinding her clit with my pubes.</p> <p>“You’re going to cum, aren’t you, your sweetheart? You’re going to make me come.”</p> <p>Her words were more in effect than actual words; there would be no denying it. Her pussy was getting hotter and tighter, and then it stopped.</p> <p>I wanted to come inside her, to fuck her till she screamed into an endless supply of orgasms, but somehow, knowing she liked it in the beginning, I got myself to the edge; and then I was there…</p> <p>And just as I was about to let go, her body stiffened, and her legs clamped around my hips, and her pussy squeezed my cock so hard it hurt, all the way to the root!</p> <p>It felt as though she had impaled herself too completely, but it must have been because the muscles of her pussy had clamped so hard they almost pushed us both over, and suddenly we were in the midst of a second orgasm.</p> <p>I kept pumping spasmodically inside her as her orgasm started, and I came again as her muscles milked me, and my body quaked and spasmed, trying to keep from coming again too often.</p> <p>I slumped onto her back, gasping weakly.</p> <p>We lay there together in each other’s arms for twenty minutes, both of us panting, but knowing nothing else in the world could make us feel the way we must have felt that first night together, and we managed to gather our breaths, but she didn’t move. Her hand lay against the back of mine, and all the muscles in my body seemed to tremble.</p> <p>“God, baby. You’ve made so much love… God, your cunt is so hot… it’s incredible!”</p> <p>All I could mumble was, “Oh, baby… You made me feel so much love like you never did…”</p> <p>“I knew it, you really did. I love you so much!”</p> <p>We cuddled in the darkness for a while, and I felt myself getting lightheaded, but it was mostly pleasure, not pain. I didn’t know I could cum again, if I wasn’t so damn drunk, but I didn’t care.</p> <p>We were lying side-by-side on my bed in a daze, recovering from what had just happened. My hands started wandering again, gently touching her. She turned and looked at me, as though she didn’t quite know what to do.</p> <p>“I’m sorry, baby… I know I shouldn’t have done that to you… I didn’t mean to do it…” but then I felt her lips touch mine, and I realized with a jolt I had kissed her once before… it was never an erotic experience that someone’s lips and tongue were capable of, even when they were on a woman! I felt my cock stir almost imperceptibly in my pants. I kissed her lightly, and asked, “Wanna do it again, sweetheart?”</p> <p>“Do what, silly?” she giggled.</p> <p>“Get to know me as someone you can trust... as a girlfriend.”</p> <p>“Okay… what was the last name of that guy?” I thought we had better go back to her apartment...</p> <p>We spent the day in a haze, and by the time we got back to her place, I was starting to feel like it was a dream.</p> <p>“You ready?” I asked, but she shook her head.</p> <p>“Do you want a beer?” I asked, and she smiled, and said,</p> <p>“Sure, why not! That was amazing! Thank you!”</p> <p>In addition to being the best sex I’ve ever had, it had also been the least I should have given her. When she said that the night she had given me, I was sure she meant that much to me.</p> <p>We left together on her bike, and I helped her get her apartment set up… but I was too excited to follow her.</p> <p>We arrived at the bar at two in the afternoon, and there were six other people there. I looked around from time to time and saw everyone we knew, but I couldn’t figure out who the other three people in—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
