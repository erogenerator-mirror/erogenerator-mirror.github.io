But if you would like to, this is all that is left of you. This is what we keep from each other."</p> <p>"I know, I'm still a virgin."</p> <p>"That does make it easier, isn't it?"</p> <p>He nodded his head yes.</p> <p>"That is what I wanted to see. We should get this started."</p> <p>He reached out and grabbed his arm and pulled him away from me.</p> <p>"Now that you have a little more information, it shouldn't be too hard to convince you of what you may need."</p> <p>"I'll never do anything like that again!"</p> <p>"Well, I know I never did, but I'm sure there was some other girls that got you into a rut."</p> <p>"How?"</p> <p>"We found out on our break that you had two lovers."</p> <p>I wasn't surprised. We've been dating for about six months now. I remember it as a moment of revelation and it brought some of my fears righting to surface. But we weren't all that concerned, and we were in the middle of a major milestone. We had known each other for at least half a month when he gave in and started experimenting. He still had those urges that would usually take a few minutes to overcome, then would start to build again.</p> <p>We talked about how to get him into making love to me. We talked about how to take to me in a way that he needed to get the hang of, and then start to enjoy it so we didn't end up as broken into by a relationship. We talked about being able to make love to him that way.</p> <p>He talked about how much he wanted to make me come in a sense. He talked about the pleasure he could have from me being with another woman that way and making him so turned on by our mutual fantasy. But the biggest surprise was that I was the one he came to with this, and wasn't going to give it to him. That didn't surprise me at all, but it made me wonder if he actually believed it was the truth.</p> <p>"I don't know why I have these thoughts, but what about you?"</p> <p>"We're getting to know you. And we've got all the questions that we want to ask you if we can."</p> <p>"Maybe that's what I want."</p> <p>"And I want to know if you really are ready to tell me."</p> <p>"I think that's a good idea."</p> <p>"Good, so now it's time for your reward."</p> <p>He reached down and caressed my shoulder and arm like I had just done before. I couldn't stop the sigh of pleasure that escaped as he leaned in and kissed my lips. As our lips touched, my pussy was soaking wet and I could feel the heat of our bodies pressing against one another. His hand moved up and slowly caressed my breast moving over it to feel the swelling in my breast as he slowly circled over it. He slowly dragged his fingers over my nipple, making it harden, as he continued to slowly run his fingernails over my breast.</p> <p>"Do you like it?"</p> <p>"Yes, I love it."</p> <p>"Well, let me know how you feel inside if you are."</p> <p>"I can't wait."</p> <p>"Good."</p> <p>He grabbed me around the waist and pulled me into the bedroom. I sat down on the bed and pulled him in the next to me. He quickly picked me up to sit me down on the bed and began to kiss me again. We continued to make out as he started to trail kisses down my body. As he kissed my tits his fingers slowly started to stroke my pussy, getting me to let out sounds of pleasure while also feeling the wetness that ran down my legs from the touch of his mouth. I could feel the urgency and lust I had been pent up for the past few months build in my groin. I let out a sigh and spread my legs a little more to let him in. He slowly circled his finger over my clit making me moan louder as I grabbed his hair and gave into him. When he inserted one, then two finger back inside of me I could feel myself coming closer to orgasm. If he did this all the way I wouldn't have believed it, but it seemed to make him that much more forceful, making me feel as if he was trying to drive his fingers deeper and deeper into me. I felt his lips kiss the inside of my thighs from my knees up. He kissed between my legs, kissing across my pussy, slowly spreading my juices around my outer lips and pushing his tongue further inside me. I let out a sigh when he finally touched and entered my pussy. When his tongue slowlyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
