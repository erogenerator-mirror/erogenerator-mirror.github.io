So I guess I should go."</p> <p>"Why?" she asked, shocked.</p> <p>"It'd be nice if you could come over to my place for a little while," I added with a grin.</p> <p>"Oh, no! I mean, no, I mean, I'd love to come," she said.</p> <p>"All right." I said, as I picked up my overnight bag and left the bar. My plans for Monday went astray. I still had the week off in the fall. I wanted to make sure that I bought a good case of wine. I really didn't want my wife with no plans for the future...or that they would end. So I walked home, but it was not the pleasant walk home that I was seeking. I kept finding myself in the mirror and wondering why I went through all of this. After just the two or three beers, this would be the last drink. At least I'm sure I would have a good hangover before I headed to the store. My mind was going a thousand miles an hour. When I got home I realized that I was not going to sleep at all and I felt really lousy. I really didn't want to look at myself in the mirror, and I really didn't want to see what I felt. After all I'm sure I looked great, with an average face. My hair was still wet from the shower, but the color was starting to turn to gray, almost black. I took the time to shave my legs and face. As I was shaving everything from under my arms and under my neck I heard her come home.</p> <p>I couldn't have been more surprised, as I was just going to drop by, to grab a pizza, or anything else for my dinner. As soon as I could, I walked into her bedroom. She was still there, sitting on the side of her bed.</p> <p>"That looks great, honey," she said.</p> <p>"Oh, thanks so much. That was great!" I replied.</p> <p>"You're really very good," she said.</p> <p>"Oh, you're not so bad yourself!" I laughed. She got back on the bed and then I sat on the bed. We shared a few more minutes, but only after we had finished our pizza. The pizza arrived with my favorite pizza. We sat, and just talked. I told what I had done and how we had gotten all of the information from my computer. She actually seemed to be taking notes on her notes as she spoke.</p> <p>"I should tell you that I still have a great idea," I told her.</p> <p>"Oh, right. Well, it's about time, but you don't have to keep telling me that," she said.</p> <p>Well, I've finally figured out what's on her mind. You see, she has been having an affair with someone else for almost three months. That's not a bad idea. But she decided to move to Arizona. She also changed her lover persona (or lack of) and started dating. I had a good idea of what the problem might be. She was going to be moving again, at least to Kansas City. Not Kansas City, but Kansas, Kansas State, or Kansas. I didn't have the heart to tell her that I was going to keep an eye on her, not that she needed to worry about me right then.</p> <p>"Well, it looks like you are planning on having sex with someone else now," I said.</p> <p>"No, not at all," she replied. "I just don't want to have to make that decision myself."</p> <p>"It's not a decision to be made alone. I want to make it with someone else while I am staying in. It's a decision you don't want to make right now," I told her.</p> <p>"I know, but it won't be the same with someone else. It's just the same with you," she said with a smile.</p> <p>"Well, I'll just have to take that first." I told her.</p> <p>"I don't think my wife will mind if you take a shower right now," she laughed. I smiled when she said that.</p> <p>"If you would like me to go," I said. "What would you like to do?"</p> <p>"Well, you know I like to take a shower, right? I just got out of bed, so I think..." she said, blushing.</p> <p>"Well, that sounds great," I agreed. She got up and stood in front of me. She slowly shook it out of the front of her dress and let it drop to the floor.
