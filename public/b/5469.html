Her hands flew to his belt as he ripped off his boxers. She tugged him up and swung her legs around, straddling his waist. Kneeling in front of him she pressed the tip of his cock to her wet and swollen pussy lips.</p> <p>"No, you can't!" He tried to twist the knob but she held him pinned and ground against him impatiently. "Fuck me!" He growled, his teeth clumsily.</p> <p>"No!" She slapped his chest, a light slap, before she took his face in her palms and gave him a long sweet kiss. "You can't. You had to get in the hotel room and fuck me!"</p> <p>He could no longer ignore their bodies crushed together as his cock slipped into her. She sighed into his mouth as he buried himself deeply in her. She let go of him and grabbed his shoulders, locking her legs around his waist, holding on for dear life. He thrust into her roughly and she shrieked into his ear. It was all too much to handle. The sight of his cock pumping into her made her feel like she had never felt before. She shook violently as he buried himself deep inside her, shuddering in orgasm.</p> <p>"I want you to fuck me," she whispered, her eyes wide as she came against him. "In the room. Don't leave!"</p> <p>He held up his hands, his stomach turning, but he could stand it no more. He pulled out, and in his haste he ripped off his shirt; her body shimmered with sweat. He lifted her up and dropped her down across him, her skin smothered in his embrace. He wrapped his arms tightly around her, her nails digging into his chest as he drove back into her one last time.</p> <p>"Oh fuck!" She let out a moan and wrapped her arms around his neck as he pulled her down hard to him. He rammed into her, slamming himself into her as far as he could. She let out a scream and her pussy clamped down on him, pulling him into her as it opened to welcome him. He slammed his hands up to her head as hers were to his, forcing her head back. She looked back into his eyes, her expression wild, wild with desire.</p> <p>"Take it," he growled, knowing that he could get no farther. It was all he could do not to reach his own peak, the feel of her wrapped around him like silk, the feel of her in his arms, and the feel of her soft, warm skin against his. With all his might he thrust into her, as deep as he could, her legs spread beneath him. They slammed together until there seemed to be no other way, then as before, he held himself there as her body convulsed around him. He felt the warmth of her against his chest, and his orgasm began to build again. He held her tightly and bit her earlobe tenderly.</p> <p>"I'm almost there!" He breathed, and she pulled her head back. He pushed into her until he felt her relax and the last of his climax crashed into his consciousness. "God!" He said, finally releasing her at last. She gasped for air as his cock softened, still hard, but a bit swollen. He kissed her lightly and tucked a stray strand of hair from her face, then leaned his head down to her stomach and she purred in response. "That was amazing," he sighed into her skin. "Can I do it again sometime?"</p> <p>"I haven't had sex in years," she said. "But you have to try." She rolled in a little closer, her back to him. "Fuck me," she whispered to him as he laid her on her back once more. "In the bed. Now."</p> <p>He nodded and slid between her legs. Even with everything he had done so far, he was a little worried about what he would do next. They were both naked, and he hadn't even touched her. How would she feel about that? He knew that if she told someone, he didn't want to know. But she had said it. He had to do what she said - what she said in her head about not doing, or saying, more dirty things, more explicit things, to her - to make her happy. They weren't alone today.</p> <p>"You've really got to get out of those clothes," he said, and she nodded, and they stood, still tangled together, her arms behind her back. At the foot of the bed, she slid the shirt off over her head, then stood on his shoulders. Her small breasts bounced as she pulled her skirt over her slender waist, and the feel of his hands sliding over her flesh was enough to make a man's cock hard.</p> <p>He stood behind her and slid his hands up her slenderâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
