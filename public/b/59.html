She just wants to be fucked hard and fast ... and the real good ones are really good... I mean, what's going on here? I know that you think that I'm a whore but I'm not a whore, I'm just a slut in heat. It's okay now to say what you want."</p> <p>"Yes, I'm listening, but it's not very nice to talk to another girl while she's fucking my cock in her tight old cunt ... not when you're so wet it barely fits in me!"</p> <p>"Don't worry, I'm sure I can handle it. I might even make her so happy as soon as she recovers."</p> <p>"Yeah, maybe you can get your old hands on her hot little body. I can even see what it looks like."</p> <p>"You can see what you look like, and I can see that you might even be able to keep her hard enough and long enough to really make it happen."</p> <p>"But you're not quite as young as she is. You're probably doing a lousy job of it! How can you tell if that's true or not when your little slut is already making you cum?"</p> <p>"It's okay, sweetheart, I know what it's like watching you on your knees in the dirt with a hot girl, sucking her beautiful titties from behind. You might be doing a pretty good job on her little cunny as well."</p> <p>"And I could get you all the way hard again, while you're eating that little titty I know you like to suck so much. You can even keep her cumming harder than you did ... like we showed you."</p> <p>"There's that big smile again."</p> <p>"Well, I'm glad you liked it; she certainly seems to like it."</p> <p>"Well, I guess we're about ready to go again. How do you think she looked when we fucked her in the barn?"</p> <p>"You've got it, big guy!"</p> <p>"I couldn't say the same for you."</p> <p>Margo had to admit that she felt pretty good about that. She'd never felt so desirable since her first man had fucked her when she'd been on the verge of finishing in the middle of her first time. She was beginning to understand what it meant to love. That old saying came back to her again.</p> <p>She remembered this young and attractive blonde in the barn. She looked like a young woman. Not so sexy as if she'd had a terrible fight with the devil, but something about the expression on her face made her think of a much older women. When she'd come home that night to find him and his little slut, she'd thought she'd finally figured something out.</p> <p>Her thoughts were interrupted by the sound of the door in the barn rustling and opening again. After a moment of confusion she got the idea that he was coming out of the cabin. He was finally entering. She had only hoped the sound of his heavy footsteps could penetrate the darkness. The light wasn't good, but something about it seemed as if he was coming through ... just a little while longer before he could come back.</p> <p>"Hello sweetheart. I'll be in the barn all this time if you like."</p> <p>A muffled "Yes."</p> <p>"Don't you even think about getting out there and peering through the hole in the wall?"</p> <p>"Yeah ... I guess."</p> <p>"Well, the little sluts are all yours and it will be nice and warm in the barn so I'm sure it won't take long before he's got what I need."</p> <p>She turned on her heel and went back to the truck. She could smell the musky scent of the hot young girl still clinging to her after her first climax. She turned on her heel and headed toward the cabin. She needed to get out of the barn and make sure they weren't going to be interrupted. But her hopes were falling short.</p> <p>In the old days she'd been afraid that she'd never seen either of them in the barn, but that was probably just wishful thinking. She'd been waiting for their return from the game, but now the sound of him coming out there would only serve to confuse her. And then, just at that moment, she realized that she had heard him moving around ... in the distance.</p> <p>She hadn't even turned to leave when she turned and saw him coming toward her, but her heart sank. She was still trembling with anticipation when he looked down at her with those beautiful blue eyes. She felt a rush of relief. She'd been so afraid. But at the same time, it hadn't stopped her from putting everything and her life back together.</p> <p>"Sweetheart ... I'm sorry if I frighten you ... I mean with their language they're never going to stop us againâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
