I was trying to keep from cumming without hurting either woman but it was becoming more difficult as we each kept going with almost constant rhythm. Each thrust, each kiss, each lick, each stroke caused the passion with which we both had built up to such a point. The intensity of our pleasure increased with each thrust and I could no longer hold back and soon my hot gooey cum started leaking from the head of my prick and running down over it. After several more thrusts with her hands on my ass, she released my dick and took the head in her mouth, sucking and licking all my juices with such a relish that it almost was a vision. As we kissed one final time, she pulled her lips away from mine and rolled over taking me with her. As we lay back and hugged each other, I started to think about how I had let myself do this to myself in a way that my sister never had. We had always been in a position of mutual pleasure and now after years of feeling guilty about it, we had even shared it with each other.</p> <p>A few hours later, as I started to drift off to sleep, she told me that she had come too. We were both tired and had just had one of the best summer nights that we had experienced in months. I told her that I could only imagine. I knew that some time would come when we would have to get up early, leave the cabin, and go to the movies. It might be lateâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
