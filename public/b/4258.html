I replied.</p> <p>"If you are willing, where is it?" she asked.</p> <p>I looked around the room. "What are the upstairs bedrooms for?" I asked back.</p> <p>She turned to look out the window again. "What about the bedroom upstairs? What's the best of the big ones." She stated.</p> <p>"You are not going to find that, you're going to find it a huge room, a huge bed." I replied.</p> <p>She reached out and gave me a gentle squeeze. We both stood there looking at each other with our hands on our lower backs.</p> <p>"I haven't even checked these upstairs yet I don't care." She said as she kissed me lightly on the lips.</p> <p>"I'll call out to tell you where to find me. As soon as the elevator is open, we'll go up." she grinned.</p> <p>Chapter 16:</p> <p>Back up in our bedroom we both climbed onto the bed. Our hands and legs entwined as the warm wet feeling of flesh pressed against skin started again. Our bodies pressed tightly together and were both sweating. We began the dance of kissing and touching.</p> <p>"I think this is going to be a trip!" I laughed as we broke our kiss and moved against each other.</p> <p>She had my shirt off, so I went over and helped her. She helped me by slipping off my shorts and panties. I had a pair of pink and green briefs on, but she pushed them down.</p> <p>"Let me," she commanded as she moved over, taking my briefs off with her, then she began licking the juices and her own from my body, licking her way up to and around my neck, then kissing her way to my ear, she began sucking on it and then began to nibble my earlobe as she did, finally reaching my lips.</p> <p>"You love this. Now lay on your back with your hips up in the air." she ordered.</p> <p>I nodded and did so, her hand moving between her legs as she watched me take my briefs off and lay on the bed, the head on the pillow.</p> <p>"It's time you started to show me that you love my pussy." she said playfully and kissed my chin and then down my neck. "Now, kiss my breast before you enter me now." she murmured, placing the nipple of her other breast between her thumb and forefinger, and gently caressed the nipple.</p> <p>I leaned my head back and she took my head between her hands and kissed my lips, mouth, and tongue. Our warm bodies slowly moved together, slowly, enjoying the feel of flesh pressing against flesh, and our tongues dancing as our lips pressed together.</p> <p>"Now, we don't have all night." she whispered sweetly. "We have to be good girls, don't we?" she added.</p> <p>I nodded and kissed her neck, my own nipples rubbing against hers. Her hands were sliding up my belly, teasing my sides as she moved her face down, my shoulders, over my breasts. She began kissing one nipple while her fingers moved over and around my belly, stomach, and pubes, then she was on her way down. Her fingers moved to my mound and began to stroke my outer outer lips when to her delight, I spread my legs apart, her fingers rubbing and stroking the length of my cunt lips as her tongue flicked out over my clit.</p> <p>I grabbed my breasts as if I were afraid someone would knock them out.</p> <p>"Oh, God!" I cried out, my back arching.</p> <p>Just then the elevator bell went off. We stopped kissing and she pushed me back on the bed.</p> <p>"You are so tight. I think you should have my cock up your cunt like a good little girl." she teased.</p> <p>"Yes, I'm a good girl. I love being your girl." I replied in a sexy voice. It was a command that my body was obeying.</p> <p>She kissed her way down my stomach moving up to my pussy, then back down. Her tongue ran over and around my cunt, her lips were stroking each side of my mound. Her hands squeezed my breasts hard as she sucked the inner lips into her mouth. Her tongue then ran along the sensitive underside of my clit and then up and over it.</p> <p>"Oh yes." I cooed.</p> <p>I closed my eyes and moaned as her fingers entered my cunt. They moved in small circles, moving in and out of me as her tongue flicked over my clitoris, the tip of it flicked over and then up across it again. Her lips massaged my cunt as she sucked my clitoris into herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
