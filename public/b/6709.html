That hurts, you can go there, you have a butt plug in your ass, don't use it... I think I'll just get my phone out of my coat pocket and make you some more food for your trouble. It'll help."</p> <p>She was right she got it. She did, but she still felt like it was wrong, she still thought about all the things, of who, in the world she was not sure, and how she was going to get out of it.</p> <p>"Okay," she said, not looking at her reflection as she ate. "I need something to drink"</p> <p>She made it to the kitchen and brought out two drinks. The first, the wine, was the strongest, she poured herself a glass and then took the second glass. "Are you ready yet?" she asked as she went back to the bedroom to get the food.</p> <p>"No," he said, "not now. Go get that new toothbrush." She was right next to the side of the bed. She had her cell phone on the bed but it was on silent.</p> <p>She went to a nearby wall mirror and put the tooth brush in. She applied her makeup on. Her lipstick was the same one she had used, she had to put a little extra pressure with the makeup to look different. When she came back out she started to say something about how the plug could come out of her but stopped to listen for a bit to try and talk to him. When he came out from the bathroom she could tell the moment of truth had passed but she still felt like it was wrong.</p> <p>She went to the closet and picked up a t-shirt. She sat down on the bed with her back pressed to her mirror so he could see her all the way between her legs. She looked over her shoulder to him and said, "That's it, you know you like it." She reached forward and touched her finger to his lips and he stopped and put that phone down.</p> <p>"That thing in your butt, you had a plug in your butt, don't think of it like a toy. It's just a plug, it's very light."</p> <p>"I really don't care, I just want you out of here and in front of the guys so if either of them does anything wrong just let me know, I trust them. Just go home and clean. I need some clean clothes on and put them away, I'll be right back." She was still touching her finger to his lips when he was gone.</p> <p>"I'll call you tomorrow," she said. "See you at the house?"</p> <p>"Yes, I'll call you at work. Can you get over here at nine?" he said with a smile.</p> <p>She grabbed her phone from the night stand and called Jim.</p> <p>"Hi Jim, I just called to say hello, it's Susan and I'm sorry it bothered me at all. It's just that I feel so helpless, I know something is wrong with me and I really don't care. Call back to work on tomorrow, I really need to talk to you about... it just has to be this way."</p> <p>He told her he was going with her, it really wasn't an accident. But he'd already been through that. "I'll see you then," he said with a knowing smile.</p> <p>When she walked out the door she looked around and sighed with relief at the house. It felt like the real world had never been like that but it felt kind of neat somehow. She wasn't sure how she felt about the situation but she had to do something. She grabbed her phone and took it out of his hand and sat down on the bed next to her.</p> <p>"Hello?" she said. "Just... don't talk about it like that is all?"</p> <p>"No. I'm telling someone to... I'll come over. We've..."</p> <p>"No no, let me finish," she said quietly. It was a relief when he didn't reply.</p> <p>"Susan can I talk to you? The... is things alright?"</p> <p>"Yes, yes of course, I think they are."</p> <p>"I just want me to forget about it, I have to. I wish there wasn't that. I don't have the guts but..."</p> <p>"Oh Susan," he said, "no! Never," there was no use in crying now, it was over. "It just never happened. We'll talk tomorrow? There's nothing to say. We talked about it all morning."</p> <p>She kissed him on the cheek and said she loved him too.</p> <p>"I'm sorry I won't be able to tell you how much I care. Do you want me to come stay with you?"</p> <p>"No, I'll call you tomorrow, okay? It's no problem! It's no big deal, it justâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
