I owe you big time too."</p> <p>"Hey, it's nice to meet you. And thank you for getting me out." she replied to him. She took another bite of her dinner.</p> <p>"Well, I'm trying to forget about you. I'm glad we met. I hope we'll see more of each other." he said.

They ate and they cuddled on the big couch. Finally they just went back to his place to finish the dinner while she took the dishes to the sink.
