His hand moved from her hair to her hips, she could feel the length of his cock between her legs, and she could swear that maybe his hand left her hair. She could not tell.</p> <p>It felt so odd to be turned on by his touch as he pulled her top of. She felt his lips kiss her neck. She wanted to let her skin against his, and she was aware of her hips moving against his.</p> <p>He broke the kiss.</p> <p>"Mmm, so wet." He chuckled. She had no idea how she had got that word. He stood up, took her hand, spun her around and led her across the room. "On your knees."</p> <p>She was startled. Her pussy and ass felt cold. It felt like she had been wearing only sandpaper. Her lips felt wet, and she felt something hard at the entrance to her vagina, then it slid into her tightness. Her knees sagged as her hands came up to wrap around his wrist.</p> <p>A voice in her ear, she hadn't realized that she had been chanting, "Fuck me..." and his body had her hips rolling. "God! Oh, that feel... good!" And suddenly he released a flood of semen from his cock into her as they stood at the top of the stairs outside.</p> <p>She fell to her knees immediately and they were both breathing hard.</p> <p>"That... it felt... good!" He leaned against the railing of the kitchen and put his arm around her neck. She leaned back, leaning against the railing, he leaned against her back.</p> <p>"That feels wonderful," she gasped.</p> <p>This was a new sensation for her husband, and it hadn't occurred to her that at this stage they might have gone too far. She knew she did not want to stop, at least not yet. As soon as his breathing became steady again, she started to whisper things to him, trying to get him to say something that would make him happy.</p> <p>"I, uh... want you to, um, do that, too?" she asked him.</p> <p>"I don't want you to just do that," he breathed, his fingers tracing her collarbone.</p> <p>"God, that feels so good!"</p> <p>"It's... going to get bigger." She reached up, grasped his neck, pulled his mouth down on hers. While he gently sucked her lower lip and circled her extended tongue with his, she undid the tie at her waist, eased the straps over her shoulders and slid her arms out of them. Her eyes closed as he leaned down, her hands ran down over his head. "It feels so amazing!"</p> <p>"Oh, uh, uh, God! It's... not long."</p> <p>He stood again. He had not come back, of course. He had moved to a cabinet, retrieved the lube, and put it in his pocket. He came back with just one hand, a tube of lubricating gel and the tube of lube and a small bottle of KY Jelly. She raised her head in surprise.</p> <p>"What! You're going to..."</p> <p>"I plan to fuck you! I want to fuck you!"</p> <p>"Well, I'm not sure I..."</p> <p>"Oh, please stop!"</p> <p>"You have to, uh, want it, too..."</p> <p>Hands grasped and she looked back to him. "Yes!" She said softly. "Put your cock in me!"</p> <p>The hand from his pocket reached toward her.</p> <p>"No!" She quickly turned around to face him. "Please put it in me! In my pussy!"</p> <p>"Well, that was a quickie. I don't want to take things too fast."</p> <p>She stared at him, looking at him in the half-light. His face was a mixture of pleasure and shock, and she could feel a throbbing in her sex. He stood up again, walked around to the other side of her, reached under her arms, turned her around and lifted her off her feet by her hips, lifted her hands to her sides, then put them on the back of her knees on the stairs. She started to put her arms around his neck, then he pulled her back toward him, kissed her and then said, "No. Lie down, on your back."</p> <p>She saw his reflection, then felt the cold, strong hands spreading the cheeks of her ass as he did so. She knew he was watching her ass move. With each step, his eyes dropped, and his hands moved as if he were playing a virtuoso instrument. She knew her thighs spread, he had a clear view behind her as much as he could see her face.</p> <p>He spread her thighs, then reached down to her hips, spread her cheeks slightlyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
