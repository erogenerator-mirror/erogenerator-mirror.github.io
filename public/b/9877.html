She smiled, and began to lightly stroke the inside of my shorts, and then I closed eyes and moaned as she slowly rubbed my member, moving her hand over the tip with a little more pressure. I was very aware of two of my other hands working in between her legs, and one of mine was stroking the outside of her lips, but it was like watching a live cat. I found myself moving my hips, making her squirm, as I heard her breathe even more sharply and she was arching her back. I heard her gasp then moan, as I started to run my finger up and down the lips, pressing against her, and then she made a low, long moan as I touched her, rubbing up and down with that tip of my finger, and then I took the tips of my fingers and traced the shape of her lips again, starting with her opening and going inside, and then continuing down to her clit where I circled it slowly. I heard her gasp and then a soft whimper, as she held the tip with her other hand, and I could feel her legs squeeze me slightly as he hips bucked.</p> <p>I was in heaven. I wanted to fuck her so badly. I could hardly believe that I was actually in that situation with another woman. My cock was raging and I was leaking into my pants. I wanted her then. I wanted anything in between, even if I was watching every second as we continued to make out. I could barely wait for the fireworks to begin. I wanted her so bad it hurt. At some point in the night, she decided she was ready for another round. We both climbed on to the bed and she sat up, still holding my cock, with her hand, and started to rub it against her lips, then slowly slid the top down, slowly working herself further around it, as I watched, and then her hand came off the tip, and with it fell, as a glistening drop, a globule, onto her cheek, as she leaned forward slightly to lick it off.</p> <p>She slid back, still holding my cock, so I opened my eyes to watch her, her gorgeous body straddled the sheets, as her legs parted, and pulled my own towards her, opening the lips of her pussy with one hand, which I used to pull myself down towards her, and then I saw her push the tip inside her, while she worked herself to try to push herself inside. Her pussy was warm around me, soft. She pushed back slowly, pushing me all the way in, and she had only one or two inches left of my hard cock inside herself. Inch by inch, I watched her.</p> <p>Her eyes met mine. She smiled, and then smiled again. I could only smile.</p> <p>And it was the smile of a woman who knew what she was doing was what she was doing was right, because, as her eyes went, I saw her, and that it was exactly what she was feeling and experiencing.</p> <p>"I love being inside you," I said into her ear one moment, but my voice shook into two parts, one part was still very clear, "I can't get enough of having you, I can't feel how much you're enjoying."</p> <p>"Mmmm...." She moaned, "I just hope you can. I want to feel you inside me so much and knowing you're just waiting for my next move. I want to be able to show you the pleasure I get from pleasuring myself."</p> <p>"I can't get over the fact that you can make me feel like that," I said, with the last bit of energy left on my voice, and she grinned, then slowly started to move up.</p> <p>She got up to her feet again, and started to get up and turn off the bed. I was too. She looked back and saw my dick, still lying against my left leg, even though it was still as hard as before, only this time it was much, much nicer. We stared again, and then she leaned down to lick her own juices off of the tip before she leaned forward again, this time spreading herself wide for me. She moved her head over the tip of my cock, and stopped once more.</p> <p>"You're the first man I've ever had," she said, slowly raising herself up and lowering her head again.</p> <p>"I love being inside you," I told her, "I can't describe how good it feels."</p> <p>My cock continued to stiffen, so I reached in to touch her again as she got more and more, almost as if making love with me was on it's way. She smiled again, her eyes watching mine closely. I was so hard, throbbing, as it made me. She brought the back of her head down onto the surface between my legs, running the tip of herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
