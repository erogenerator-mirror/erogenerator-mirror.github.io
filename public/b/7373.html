So that, too, is up to you," he continued softly. He moved her hair back, watching silently as she took a deep breath. "Now I'm going to get really comfortable and do it."</p> <p>He moved the towel to her shoulder to cover her, then reached around her and started to rub her shoulders and back again. He pulled her arms towards her, as if to cover herself. She looked up at him, startled. "What's wrong, honey? Do I have hair on my hands?" She shook her head. "I'm just wondering," he started. As he looked down on her he could see the water trickling down her back and down between the two cheeks of her ass. He bent down and licked it off, tasting her for the first time. "You know, there was something in the water that made me dizzy," he whispered to her. She pushed her face into his neck and smiled, then looked away, avoiding his eyes.</p> <p>"Oh, did something touch your pussy," she said softly, as her nipples stood out so prominently. He glanced down and sure enough there was a large damp patch, probably growing between the cheeks of her ass. He rubbed her gently at first, enjoying the feel of her skin with long fingers. He knew it was the first sign of arousal that dawned on any lover.</p> <p>"I guess I did." He slowly turned her towards him, watching her eyes as she opened her mouth. He bent his head. "Just a little longer... maybe not much more," he said in a soft voice as his tongue grazed hers. When he lifted his face slightly she moaned, leaning forward to kiss him. They kissed with their hands exploring each other. She started to pull away, and he kissed her again. Their tongues danced and explored, touching each other with new vigor as they felt the wet heat of each others' bodies. She moved forward again, sliding her pussy down the inside of his thigh. This time as she felt his hardness she pressed her body forward against his, grinding against him. He ran a hand down her back and felt her shiver. He kissed her again, running his free hand over her soft breasts.</p> <p>They broke their kiss. He put his hand between her legs again, rubbing her slit gently, watching her face in the mirror. She looked startled, then turned back towards him, pushing back against his fingers. He slid them slowly inside her, watching their tongues as he started working them a little deeper and deeper into her. His finger was moving in and out of her slowly with the smooth rhythm of her pussy, pressing against the walls of her tunnel. He bent his head to kiss her again, her breathing heavier now as her back arching. Her knees went weak, so he pulled his hand from her wet opening and leaned forward to kiss and lick the wet skin of her breasts. She squirmed and shook with anticipation and her tongue teased his ear as he suckled on the nipple.</p> <p>"Oh yeah... that feels good..." she hissed. He sucked her nipple harder, then licked it gently with his tongue. He pushed her toward the floor, and she sat on the edge. She leaned back, spreading her legs in invitation for him to come on top of her. They moaned together, writhing with need and lust. She slid her hand down his torso, feeling the heat and hardness of his erection pressed against her thigh. He pushed his head up to her, and she kissed the mouth, sucking on his lower lip gently. She tasted like sweet-mixed strawberries, salty and delicious on his tongue. A moan escaped her as she tasted herself on his tongue. He lifted his head, moving his mouth slowly over her face to her neck, and she moaned again as he nibbled softly, pulling at her nipple with his teeth.</p> <p>He started kissing her down her chest and stomach, reaching her navel and then his hand went down to her pussy. "Oh... there you go!" she whispered. "That feels so good... oh yeah." She spread her legs and he slid two fingers inside her, feeling her wetness. As he brought them up to her clit she felt the tip of his tongue licking her hole. "Oh... oh... yes..." she said, lifting her legs and trying to push into his mouth with her hands.</p> <p>"I'm glad you're enjoying that," he whispered while kissing her again. His body pressed against hers, his cock trapped between them, pressing against her pussy. She could feel his hard penis against her and she spread her legs to let him move more easily, pressing her legs tightly around his hips. The feel of his hard body against hers, the feeling of his cock pressed against her, and everything about this moment was so special. She slid one hand back, and held his face for his first kiss this evening. She kissed him backâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
