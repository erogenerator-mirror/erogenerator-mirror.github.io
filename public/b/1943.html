Her hands flew to her mouth as she tried to push back but he held her firmly. He kissed her all over her neck, teasing her as he worked his way to her ear.</p> <p>"Do you want me to stop?" he whispered.</p> <p>"No..." She whimpered. "Please." She whispered.</p> <p>He slid down over her body and kissed her breasts all over, while working down to her stomach he found the spot that gave her the most pleasure. Her breasts were big and plump. He licked her nipples and she closed her eyes. He slowly worked her lips with his tongue. Her hands went to his head as he worked into her lips with his tongue. Her passion was building as she moaned in ecstasy. He used his mouth on her with more determination. Her back arched as she exploded. Her cries sounded soft and sexy and he knew he had her. She wanted him to fuck her. As she shook in an after spurt with a soft yelp he slowed his action.</p> <p>"I have to go," he said.</p> <p>He slid to the side and got up to go to his room. As he moved his pants back up she slipped out of the shower and dried off as she looked over naked. But they did not have sex yet! Why not? His cock was already hard in her hand.</p> <p>She finished out a bath and slipped into it. Her nipples were hard and her pussy was wet. She got dressed and found a note from Chris. It was signed "I love you." It was one of the few things he said in the week when they were alone. To be honest, he liked the sound of that as well.</p> <p>It was Saturday morning and his parents were leaving for his birthday on September 1st. So she was going as she usually did for family, going shopping with her parents and then back to his house to continue talking with him and then go out for drinks and dinner. His father and her parents had been together since college. He loved being with them and their little family. He missed having a close relationship with her. After talking with her parents, they finally agreed and it was a good thing that he didn't have to drive all the way to her parent's house.</p> <p>She put on her pajamas and then waited until she heard the door shut. She took her keys out from the jewelry box she had made earlier and opened the door and froze. Chris was on the bed wearing his boxer shorts. He smiled at her as she looked at his sexy face. He had a sexy, smile that made her instantly wet. He wasn't a very fit guy. She smiled at him to show her appreciation but then remembered that she also loved a man like him. She closed the door as she reached for the key.</p> <p>"Please" she said in a sweet voice. "Come in. I need to change." She heard him take something from the closet and her hand fell to her hip. She stepped into the bedroom and sat down on the bed. She waited a minute.</p> <p>"I have been waiting for this. I wanted to do just you." With that he sat down beside her and pulled her to him. Just a quick kiss on the lips and he slipped the key into the slot. He pressed a finger in the padlock and the door unlocked. He held his hand out to her and she opened the door and started to pull him in. He held on to her and slid his arm around her. She stepped into the doorway to her room and closed the door behind her.</p> <p>"You can change in the bathroom until I get out to shower up. That was fun." As he said the last, he pulled her close and kissed her again. She felt his hands on her hips as he moved them down to her ass. He slowly slipped a hand under the waistband of her pajama bottoms. He could feel the heat of her pussy on his palm as he began to work one finger into her pussy. She felt the tip of his finger slide past her lips and then glide slowly up to her clit. She tried to get him to slip in but he quickly pulled back.</p> <p>She watched him, her mind racing as she tried to focus on his face. His eyes were closed and his chest was heaving just slightly as he breathed deeply. His eyes met hers slowly as she felt his fingertips move ever so slightly across her clit. She could feel her body tightening but couldn't quite get loose in the shower this morning. Her pussy was tingly all over again.</p> <p>"Let me turn all the lights down for you." She heard him say as he lifted the switch. She couldn't turn them on so she turned them down just a tiny bit.
