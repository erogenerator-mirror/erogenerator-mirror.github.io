But I couldn't ignore the fact that she made me feel like shit and that it was because of her. My anger was only making sense.</p> <p>"Well, your actions are going to have to wait until next spring," I said. "However, I don't think you need to be jealous. I think you need to look at yourself and see what you look like." I pointed at her. "There wasn't any sense showing off. You look gorgeous in every skirt you own!"</p> <p>"I did not wear those things in front of everyone," she said.</p> <p>She was looking at herself.</p> <p>I knew I had upset her. I hated myself for thinking that she would feel the same way about me.</p> <p>"I'm proud of your self confidence; you look like you're ready to be on television," I said.</p> <p>"Thank you. You were right, it's really nice being appreciated." A small smile appeared on her face, as if she had finally forgiven me for having an effect on the situation.</p> <p>She was looking at the ceiling again, as if she was going to cry. The emotion was so intense it made me feel very uncomfortable. She looked like she was almost trying to put something in my eye, but she still couldn't say anything.</p> <p>"No, you're right. I'm glad you felt better than I did," I said. "This isn't a problem. I really have nothing to lose by being unreasonable. You are beautiful. You are smart, funny, smart people. I don't envy you much anymore. I'm sorry for falling for your bullshit. I hope we'll see each other a lot."</p> <p>It was like a punch to the gut. That wasn't at all what I had hoped for either.</p> <p>"You're the greatest guy in the world, you really are," she said. "Do you know how many guys would fall for that?"</p> <p>"Maybe, but in a place like this, that's a lot of odds to me." I thought. That was exactly what she wanted, to show off to anyone. I hated myself for being so shallow. She was still standing in front of me looking at herself. She started to shake her head. There was nothing of any effect in what she was doing.</p> <p>"I'm sorry," she said. "I didn't mean it. I didn't mean to be so harsh."</p> <p>"I'm sorry," I said. "I don't want you to apologize for something you can't forgive. You're beautiful."</p> <p>She shook her head. At this point, it was not so much what I had intended to say, but rather what she was doing standing in front of me.</p> <p>"There are people out there who have never looked at women in a medical school, who don't have any interest in women, who seem only interested in their own body," I said. "Women aren't really my type."</p> <p>"What is most interesting about you is that you have a body. Women aren't the type for you, because of your age. Women are all different."</p> <p>"If I didn't have that body, I would never be the type of person you want to see naked, with other females. Just to be sure, I keep the legs short, especially around me, or I am a size 14," I said. She blushed a little.</p> <p>"I wasn't being nosy, but you are a different person, and probably more intelligent. If you like your body, and people like it, you can look back on this for a long, long time," I said.</p> <p>I reached forward to gently caress her face. My hands were just inches from her cheek. Her eyes got even brighter. Her hand went lower to cup my face. I wasn't prepared for how close my hands came to touching her skin. She looked so young, so innocent. I leaned in to kiss her. I opened my mouth a little, but she didn't offer her tongue. She just looked at me, waiting for me again. I didn't want to go any further.</p> <p>"No, you can't," she said. "I love you. I don't want anything from you. Just look at me and let me appreciate you."</p> <p>She was looking down, not doing anything. She wasn't moving her hands, as if she were ashamed of her body. Her face appeared just a little softer. She looked like she was trying to see if it would work. I kissed her again. In our kiss she was the one who initiated it. She was the one I was trying to emulate. All the times I had been afraid of her, but now I couldn't imagine being in a situation like thisâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
