I am very flattered and that is really what I always feel like. I am here alone so it's alright if you want to get together. I've got nothing better to do here, I am here with you.' I leaned forwards and held her hand and then kissed it. Without breaking contact I looked deep into her eyes and she knew there was no turning back. She had me and now she would be mine.</p> <p>In my bed she had put her clothes back on and she looked at me again and smiled 'I was starting to forget about you as you were...' She looked at me with her sweet smile 'I think it might be time now.'</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>The next day I was sitting at the breakfast table on my front porch when she came into view. She came right over to me and hugged and kissed me again. As I hugged and kissed her our lips brushed against each others. We broke our kiss just short of our lips touched, when we broke again we kissed each other on both cheeks, then we opened our mouth and kissed again.</p> <p>'Oh Paul!' she cried out 'Paul this time!' Her tongue came out and pressed against mine. I was very surprised by the feeling of pleasure of her soft tongue against mine, even after all those years together. 'Oh Paul, can we do that again?' she asked in excitement.</p> <p>'I think so too.' I replied.</p> <p>She pulled me against her as I continued to kiss her. We were both panting with desire. We just stared at each other as our kissing became more passionate. I could feel her nipples pressing against the front of her thin nightdress.</p> <p>'Would you let me take this off,' she asked me.</p> <p>'Oh yes please, let's have it off,' I said. We both had to get our breath back. I slipped it off and she slid her top off. I gazed at her lovely breasts and the soft pink nipples as they appeared to perk up.</p> <p>'My goodness,' she breathed 'you have beautiful breasts... and lovely nipples too, like ripe fruits. It looks so lovely. My darling,' she said as she kissed me.</p> <p>I had her again. We made out in the middle of the dining room, with all the neighbours and staff looking at us. I felt so warm and safe. At last we could let go to our passion. We got each others clothes off and I made her sit down topless, facing me. I then slipped my shorts off and sat on the same chair in front of her. Our mouths again touched, and we exchanged the first kiss we had ever got. Our lips touched again and we pulled apart.</p> <p>We lay side by side on the soft grass. I put my back against the tree and pulled her on top of me. We started making out and I was rubbing up and down her lovely body. Her breasts were soft and plump; I took one of them gently in my hand, gently caressing it. She moaned at my touch and then moved to my neck. I was getting turned on. I slid my finger inside her opening. She moved her hips against me. I could feel her breathing getting faster and her nipples grew harder against me. She got a little dizzy from her excitement and her hot breath became a little bit fainter. I knew she was getting very excited as she made small and soft mewing sounds in her throat.</p> <p>The next thing I knew, I felt her opening her legs under mine. She moved her face closer to me until it was right under my face, and started to kiss my lips. She moved her head lower and started to suck my neck again. I started to feel that wonderful feeling of excitement as I slowly moved my tongue up her neck just below her ear. Her body started to gyrate against me.</p> <p>'Please,' she gasped, 'I want to do it, do it for me, you make me so excited.'</p> <p>'I don't know if you want me,' I whispered to her.</p> <p>'No...no, just come to me, I want you so much.' She looked up at me. 'Can we do that again?' Suddenly she grabbed me by the shoulders. 'Come now!' she said.</p> <p>'Yes, please.' I said and got to my feet. I took both her hands and put them above her head on the grass.</p> <p>I could feel her trembling as she felt my naked body against hers. I had seen her naked breasts and she also felt me as I lay naked on her back. I lay over her and lay one of her fingers inside my opening and I kissed her passionately.
