"You're so soft, and it feels so good when you move against me like that" I told her.</p> <p>"I never knew I could do that" she sighed. "I've never felt this way about anyone before. Thank you for giving me a chance to feel this good," she said. Now I felt my cock start to twitch and the sensation was incredible. I kissed her neck. "I can't believe how good it feels" I sighed.</p> <p>"Your cock feels so good in me that it feels like your whole body is touching mine" she said.</p> <p>"It's been a while," I sighed.</p> <p>"Oh God I still need to do things to you but I don't know any of them now. I was thinking about some thing, but now it's coming to me," she said. I felt her hand find my groin and start to rub. She started to move her hips up and down and then with her eyes closed I felt her soft thighs open up and felt my cock being squeezed by her warmth. "Ooh it's so good, so very good" she sighed.</p> <p>"Your cock feels so big in me; I couldn't help myself but move it in and out and around and around," she said. "God you are so good" she added. I leaned in and our lips met and our tongues intertwined and our lips explored each other's mouths. My hand dropped to her breast and I tweaked her nipple and she moaned and pushed the whole of her body against me. I let go of her and started to sit up. "Oh no, not on top" she said as she pushed me back down and kissed me again. This kiss was much more passionate, a bit demanding. Her hand began to explore my body and she lifted it up for a moment and then ran her fingertips down my torso toward my cock. She traced my cock with her index finger and the shaft and then she looked up at me and gently kissed me below my ear. "I've wanted to do that for such a long time" she said.</p> <p>"Why did you do it to me?" I asked.</p> <p>"It wasn't something I've done for you," she said. She ran her tongue along the top of my ear gently.</p> <p>"I've never done anything like this either, I've told you it was too weird for a girl."</p> <p>"No it's not weird, it's just that I don't know how to let you go so totally. It's been my fantasy for ages," she told me.</p> <p>"Can I hold you?" I asked.</p> <p>"Of course," she sighed and slid her arm over me and held me tightly against her.</p> <p>"When you were about five minutes, I had to stop myself from making you cum and I'm pretty sure it was worth it."</p> <p>"Oh you were really good," she told me.</p> <p>I wrapped my arms around her and we kissed again. My hand slowly lowered to where she was just able to hold me against her, and I caressed her back and felt the warm softness of the skin on skin again.</p> <p>"You still need to hold me?" She asked.</p> <p>"Is that really what you need?" I asked.</p> <p>"It will, but I think you'll feel better when you feel my pussy around you," she said.</p> <p>"I'm trying but I can't really go in until I've gone in half a dozen times. You probably need to go in too, it's going to be a long night."</p> <p>"Not at the first, I think I'll go in a little and enjoy what you're doing," she said.</p> <p>"No! Oh God no, let me try to hold you with the one hand, I want to hold you as long as possible, please," I pleaded.</p> <p>"Oh God," she said as she slipped her other arm around my neck to pull me toward her. She kept squeezing my neck as she pressed her lips to mine and we kissed. "Oh, God, that was perfect, you feel so damn good," she said softly.</p> <p>"Are you sure you want to? The way we're kissing, I just feel like I'm about to have a giant orgasm."</p> <p>"I just wanted to feel it in the same way," she said as she pushed her hips up against mine.</p> <p>"It won't be that big with me though," I told her as we broke for air. "I would just do the same thing with you if I could," I said. "I'll do everything I can about it when my mind is clear," I added.</p> <p>"If you do, I really would like for you to do this again," she said.</p> <p>"Reallyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
