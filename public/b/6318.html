I've got a surprise for all of you," he grinned, "and as I said, I'm not just talking about dinner! It is now, and you won't have to wait long, too," with that, he left the room.</p> <p>I stood there in front of her for a moment and then, I sat on the arm of the couch, not really sure if I was going to say it.</p> <p>"What's wrong?" She asked, and without bothering to cover the bulge in my pants, I nodded, "I, I'm so embarrassed!" she added hastily, her tone not sounding convincing.</p> <p>"It's okay to be embarrassed," I managed to say. I looked her squarely in the eye, holding it for all of eternity, "It's a big deal! I just wasn't expecting it. If you'd just shut that door and never turned around, I'm sure the whole room would explode!"</p> <p>"I don't understand," she said.</p> <p>I laughed. "I've always thought of you as a person. In this position, you're even more amazing," I said, staring at her.</p> <p>She stood slowly, and reached down. She cupped her hands around her breasts and pulled them closer together, lifting them from within her top, and staring as they came down toward her navel. She ran her hands over them and smiled at me, her eyes sparkling with mischief before she put them both back on the arm of the sofa. She turned toward me, her eyes still looking right up at me. As she turned, she put her hand to her mouth, and began to wipe it slowly before leaning forward to let me suck her own fingers, then she leaned back, looking into my eyes again.</p> <p>She looked good enough to eat! I thought to myself.</p> <p>She sat down beside me, but I could feel her hands wandering along my lap. They had nothing on mine. "Do you mind if we have drinks?" she asked, and then turned to her handbag, pulling it back. "We can get a bottle of champagne, too?"</p> <p>I nodded. I felt like I might faint! She opened the door, stepped out, and sat down at the end of the couch in the same position, so that she was looking right at me. In spite of being completely naked, and the way she was sitting, I noticed that one of her breasts was not touching the cushion she was sitting on, but there was enough room for her arm hanging from one forearm.</p> <p>I took a drink of my wine, and as she did so, I lifted both her hands over her head, and slipped them both into one of her breasts as I had before. I could feel her body quiver as it moved up and down against mine with each movement she made. I felt her warm body, and her soft mews of pleasure, that were muffled by my hand in her hair, and as I drank I could see her face as she continued to look right at me, her eyes sparkling with sexual satisfaction, her lips parted slightly to breathe a few breaths.</p> <p>In a moment, we both felt a sense of calmness, of being able to let ourselves go without fear of embarrassment. As she moved, and in a moment her eyes were back down into mine, I felt she was looking at the hardness of me. As we remained watching each other, I started to say something, but she placed her finger between my lips.</p> <p>"Don't," I said as I began to speak. "I don't want to ruin your surprise any further."</p> <p>She was smiling, and as she did so, she began to move with me, as if she intended to take everything she would, and in so doing, she was sliding right up against the hardness of me. I could feel her nipples sliding up and down my thigh as she rubbed herself against me for all that it was worth. But in the back of her mind, as if she was looking down into my eyes, she noticed just how I was able to make her body move with a sexual passion, and as she moved with me, she noticed that she was having an effect on me. I could hear her breathing, and the sound of her body as she moaned and writhed against me, as if, as if she knew I was there, she was giving herself to me completely, totally, and for all the world, without inhibition. My cock was as hard as it had ever been as I rubbed myself against her, and felt her begin to shiver.</p> <p>She placed her mouth next to my ear and breathed, "I think I'm getting wet now. Can I turn around now?"</p> <p>"Oh yes," I said, and reached out, cupping her ass with my hands and as if I were to take it, I lifted the hem of her robe so that I could feel herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
