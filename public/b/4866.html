"He's an expert at this." Both the men laughed at that and the girls laughed at his.</p> <p>"Don't you dare, bitch!" she shouted. "He's just doing his job! Don't you give permission, now!"</p> <p>"No, Mistress!" came the reply, but the man held up his hands for her to stop. "I think he's learned!"</p> <p>"Good boy!" she said, kissing him again, but this time pushing him down into the bath before coming off. "Show me his talent!"</p> <p>He was a good boy after all, and soon was in the water. It felt good, too, to touch him, to wash away the tension of the day.</p> <p>"That's great! You are turning into a sexy little fuck-toy!" she said, rubbing her crotch against his. "Now you know how to make a woman feel good, and take care of her!"</p> <p>She put one foot on the toilet, and pulled the boy so he could look at her pussy for a minute. "He's learned everything you've taught me!" she said, running a finger along the top of his prick, "He's been such a good boy!"</p> <p>Then she took his dick in her hand and rubbed it up and down in the water.</p> <p>"Are you ready, stud?" she said, looking a little wily at him, "you haven't earned a proper cleaning inside this bath yet?"</p> <p>He gave a start. "We'll be in a few minutes," he said.</p> <p>He started to put his clothes on, and she grabbed his cock and stopped him.</p> <p>"Leave that on," she said, handing him his clothes. "I'll clean the bath."</p> <p>"Sorry, Mistress," he said, still trying to get his socks on.</p> <p>She grabbed the boy by the back of his neck and pulled up his pants, making a couple of yanks. "Don't worry about it!" she said, and turned around to kiss him, still holding on to his neck.</p> <p>"I am sorry, Mistress!" he said, sounding contrite. "You let me go!"</p> <p>"Sorry, I don't know," she said, turning to face him. "Just take what happens, boy." Suddenly she turned away and began scrubbing the bathroom. He could see how her ass looked in the white, bikini bottoms, her tiny, pink hole, waiting for a man to fill it. He could feel the muscles of her tight little butt, the muscles that moved as if they had a mind of their own as he scrubbed the soft flesh of her cheeks.</p> <p>"Sh-..." he began. Suddenly, she spun around and pushed him down and he lost it. They both fell onto the bath. He put his arms around her, pressing against her, his cock in her pussy as his hand groped her naked breasts.</p> <p>"What're you—" he said, looking down at his hands, his prick in her cunt. "Don't look at where you are!"</p> <p>"Sorry, I can't do that," she said, "no man can." She pulled out of his grasp, and he turned to get up.</p> <p>"Take my clothes off, lover." she said, reaching for his tie and pulling him up. "We don't want anybody to come in here, just like we did today." She looked at him for a second. "You're such a sweet boy!"</p> <p>"No, Mistress!" he said. "I'm a good boy. I can't do that!"</p> <p>She reached down and pulled his shirt off, so his nipples were right in her face when they touched her fingers. "Oh, no, silly!" she said. "That's all that's important. It's all that's important."</p> <p>He tried to cover his growing cock with one arm, but her hand held it firmly. "I don't want anybody to see that!" she said. "Look, just like before." She got his pants off, and turned the shower on. "Take my shoes off!" she said, pressing her fingers into her heels and pulling them out of the water.</p> <p>She got his socks off and stepped into the shower. The water from the showerhead hit her skin. She kissed him, not just on the lips, but on his neck, his cheeks, and across his brow. Then she kissed his forehead and put her hand inside his briefs.</p> <p>He put his hands behind his head, feeling her soft lips on his ear and down his neck. "Oh, God! No! I can't do that—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
