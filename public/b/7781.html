I'm sorry. Please forgive me," the lady apologized to her daughter, whose eyes were still closed in pain.</p> <p>"Let's change the subject. How could I want anything to do with them?" I asked.</p> <p>The man was looking at me with sympathy, and it showed in how difficult he seemed to be to read.</p> <p>"The lady has a little problem. Do you want a glass of water?" I said, indicating with my eyes for the young lady that she could do the same.</p> <p>The daughter nodded, her eyes still closed, her face reddening in embarrassment as she gulped down the water.</p> <p>"She looks a lot like you," I observed. A warm glow seemed to emanate from between her legs, and I realized that she may be one of my students. "I mean, your body is really attractive, too. Did you ever have a lover?" I asked, taking another sip of water from another glass.</p> <p>"Oh, no, I'm quite happy. I think that it's a common fantasy for many females to have sex with another woman," she laughed. "She's a big girl, isn't she? I'll bet that she has some big cocks," she added with sarcasm.</p> <p>"You're awfully sure about that," I observed. "If you can just tell me the truth, you can have all the guys that you want," I added with my hand to the younger lady's cheek.</p> <p>"Yeah, okay. I'm just nervous," she replied, blushing again.</p> <p>"Then I guess you're ready to make your decision now," I laughed.</p> <p>"Well, I guess a lot of you can be a little nervous, right?" she asked, looking up at me with her dark brown eyes.</p> <p>In response to her question, I rose and held my hand out.</p> <p>"I'll go get my clothes," I said. "Don't worry about your clothes. They're clean and dry, not covered in mud, and most definitely not dirty. I should probably be naked before we set out, just so that I can get into your pants, too," I added with a wink.</p> <p>"You got it, Dad," she said, and smiled with a look of excitement as she did so. "I'm flattered, too," she added shyly.</p> <p>I smiled at her self-assuredness. She didn't seem so timid in the slightest.</p> <p>"If you want, I'll go get my clothes. Then we can go wherever the hell we want," I said with a grin as I turned around to leave my daughter's room.</p> <p>When I got back with her clothes, she put them on the clothesline at the bottom of the bed, then put the clothing away on a chair. I took the clothes to the bathroom, and returned with her wet clothes, just in case.</p> <p>The moment we entered the room, I looked down to find her nude body hanging from a chair in the middle of the room. I was not sure how her large breasts would splay out when she sat on the stool. Her nakedness seemed more fragile than my normal standards. She seemed even less experienced and experienced than her Mom.</p> <p>"Wow, Mom...You look so beautiful. I really like that you're here," she responded.</p> <p>I took her hand and brought it up to my lips.</p> <p>"My name's Jennifer."</p> <p>"I'm sorry I missed you when you lived in Europe. I've really missed you all that weekend," she said, taking my face in both her hands and kissing me with her soft lips. "I've missed you so much," she added. "Now, let's dance," she said, taking me from the floor and leading me off.</p> <p>The music was soft, romantic, and it was really moving to the slow beat of the music. It seemed to flow from our hips, connecting between us as we danced to the music. It was clear that she was feeling the same rhythm as me, as the beat throbbed between our bodies. Her touch was almost like magic, though, and the music seemed to take on a more sensual tone.</p> <p>She pulled me closer to her as we danced, moving herself against me, causing my dick to move between her legs, its hardness evident in the fabric of her pants. Our arms entwined and we pulled each other tighter towards ourselves.</p> <p>I could feel her warm skin against mine.</p> <p>"Oh, Jennifer. You're so beautiful," I said. "I love touching you all over," I added, kissing her on the mouth gently, tasting her breath.</p> <p>"I love touching you and seeing those big beautiful breasts of yoursâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
