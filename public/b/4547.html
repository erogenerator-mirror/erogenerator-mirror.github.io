He looked down at her, then back down at her. "Do come and join me in the corner here. You're not in my room, and since you're on your own you better hurry up and get dressed. You're gonna be late."</p> <p>He was right. She quickly straightened her clothes, then turned around and left his room. He followed her to the corner, and noticed some boxes lined the wall. She looked around expectantly as she passed them and smiled at him and went to them again. He went right after her. The box at the corner was still on the wall, but was gone.</p> <p>He stopped her as she passed it. He couldn't believe what he was looking at. 'Holy shit, she's a virgin.'</p> <p>'Oh, God.' 'I didn't think I had to ask.' His voice echoed in his head. There was something about this sexy girl. Just looking at her made him feel guilty. He grabbed her hand, and led her into the living room. There, he started to pull her into the corner again, and he couldn't resist.</p> <p>"Here, let me turn on this light." He held his hands up for her to take them off.</p> <p>She slowly took her hands away, but he kept pulling them back. He pushed her down until she had to lean on the wall and had to reach backwards to turn off the light. It was dim, but it was the only light in the room. His hands continued to reach down to her sides as he pushed her closer to him, her body leaning up toward his with each step and he had to get his hands under her arms to pull her face forward. He wrapped his hands around her breasts and squeezed.</p> <p>'You're gonna make me come right now.' He thought. He couldn't get a grip on himself now, he didn't even know what to do with himself. If he didn't start to relax, he might never get another chance. All he could do was to keep squeezing, pinching, and caressing.</p> <p>'Hee-hee-hee! Ahhhhhh, God, his little slut sister is still a virgin!'</p> <p>Honey groaned in her throat as her back and his hand pressed into her more firmly. She was panting as he worked down. Her breasts heaved in his hands as he pressed them against her. He pulled hard back, pinching hard into the skin, stretching it out and trying to get blood to rush in between.</p> <p>"Mmmmm, oh God! Ahhhhhhh! Ahhhhhhhh!" She groaned, her breathing getting heavier. He continued feeling her body underneath his hands as he squeezed, pinched, and pulled. He wanted his hand on her, but couldn't touch it. Her breasts were bigger and heavier than he had thought before, so he knew she couldn't feel his hands and fingers exploring like this.</p> <p>After a few minutes of trying to get her to feel his hands, he felt her breathing change and tighten up. A moan escaped out of her mouth as he held her down and squeezed her boobs. He had to hold her as she moaned and came. He kept his fingers from feeling her pussy and moved his hand down her body. She was panting a little more as he moved his fingers to her stomach.</p> <p>"Oh, God, baby you're beautiful," he smiled down to her.</p> <p>She moaned again, her chest heaving and her hips moving in response. "Now, I'm going to teach you a few things," he told her as he released her tits and helped her up into the chair. "But before I get started, let me give you something to put on for you."</p> <p>Honey looked in anticipation as he sat down in a seat in the corner. "What are you doing, sir?" she asked as she got down on her knees. She was still standing up and just looked up at him as a big grin spread over her face.</p> <p>"I'm teaching you about being a man. You are gonna experience men, man, real men."</p> <p>She smiled and looked up at him questioningly, then leaned forward to kiss him. Their tongues touched as her lips slid up and down. Oh, why was she such a tease? But she was going to do anything at this point to please him, so he was going to make sure she enjoyed herself. He'd have to be patient.</p> <p>Honey pulled her mouth away from him, and sat back to look at him. "How many people will be waiting in your room for you at this time, hm?"</p> <p>He got a serious look on his face. "Hm? How many people will be waiting for me there? Are you sure you're all right with me?"</p> <p>"Yes, I'm all rightâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
