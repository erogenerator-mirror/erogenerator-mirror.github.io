"You want me to make you feel good?" she said as she stepped toward me and began running her hands up and down my back.</p> <p>"I think you want me to make you feel good," I said. "That's what you needed."</p> <p>"I do, so you can make me feel good," she said. "I really need to feel good."</p> <p>I had my hands on the counter to balance myself, but before I could get the bar over the top she pulled me closer, and I felt her lips against my cock. It felt so good, even after having just cum, the fact that I had finally got to do something with her and was finally sharing this with someone I loved.</p> <p>"Mmmmmmm, feels so great," I said, still trying to work my hands up and down her back.</p> <p>"Well, here comes the first step," she said.</p> <p>She took her hands, and slowly lowered me back to the desk. When the tip of my cock touched that little nub, she stopped immediately, looked me in the eye, and said, "My turn," and dove on board.</p> <p>We rolled around on the desk, kissing, grinding, and running our hands down from her back to her ass. She had my shirt off now, and I was working her lacy pink underwear down her legs. As she pulled them off, her hands went right for my raging hard on and she began to stroke it.</p> <p>We took our time playing with each other's bodies. She had her hand down my back, feeling the contours of my ass and back and even down to my balls. Then, she turned me over, and kissed me on the mouth while cupping my erection in her hand.</p> <p>"Oh, God, Steve," she moaned, "this is the best, sexiest thing I ever did, the sexiest. You need to cum, don't you?" she said.</p> <p>"Yes!" I moaned as I felt her squeeze my dick.</p> <p>"I'm gonna suck you off," she panted. "Fuck me if you have to. That would be awesome."</p> <p>We both got out of our clothes as I started to push her back to the desk.</p> <p>"No," she said. "Let me."</p> <p>She pushed me back.</p> <p>"But you don't have to do everything," I said.</p> <p>She pulled off her underwear, then slid over the side of the desk between my legs.</p> <p>"No," she said, then stuck out her tongue and ran it down the middle of my shaft.</p> <p>"Oh, God, this feels so good," I moaned out as she ran her tongue up and down the top of my dick.</p> <p>"Mmmmm," she cooed as she swirled her tongue in a circle around the tip of me. Then she went back for her own, and went all the way down to the base of my dick. The feeling was so good, I moaned even louder this time.</p> <p>"Ooooooh, God, I'm going to cum," I said into the phone. "Just cum in my fucking cum!"</p> <p>I couldn't hold on anymore.</p> <p>"I'm so glad you came to see me, Steve," she said, pulling on my dick a few more times. "I was so horny after you started doing that, and, well, now my pussy's got some work to do."</p> <p>"I'll let you know what my next move is if I get a chance," I said as she pulled off. "You can still do the rest."</p> <p>I looked back at the phone and said, "If you have the time, let me know next week, okay?"</p> <p>"Okay," she said. "That's for sure, baby. You're the best, lover!"</p> <p>She handed me the phone as I got up, then sat on the chair and began to stroke my hard-on to the thought of her sucking me off.</p> <p>"Are you close?" she asked. "I mean, are you, Steve?"</p> <p>Her question gave me some pause. And then, "I'm close, too," I said. "Just let me know."</p> <p>"Sure," she said.</p> <p>"No, no, no, I know this is really, really, really not fair. You're fucking great. Really great." I grabbed my dick and stroked while she continued to talk.</p> <p>"Yeah, and you're hot!" came out of her mouth. "Oh, wow, Steve, you really are amazing!"</p> <p>"You are soâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
