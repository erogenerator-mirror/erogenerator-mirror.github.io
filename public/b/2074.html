Then, her eyes widened as she stared at my erection pressing into the bottom of the tub.</p> <p>"Ooooh... I see. Are you ready for round two?" She raised her hand again and slowly pulled them all the way forward. Slowly, the water started to cool again, and then she stepped out of the tub. She wrapped a towel around herself and reached down. She started drying her hair. With the towel, she stroked the back of her hand around her neck. She turned. It was a very sexy walk from our bathroom, but we could live with the fact that this was not what we had in mind.</p> <p>I opened a bottle of wine cool. She did the same. We went and got ice for us. We didn't bother to put anything on. We had some wine, and then we sat and sipped. A small but very comfortable warmth came through my body. I felt I had a warm, fuzzy feeling about my new woman. Her eyes still had the same warm glow. She didn't do anything in return of what I had hoped, but she did seem to be really enjoying the wine in my eyes. She looked away as she drank about half of the glass.</p> <p>I felt I knew where I wanted this to go. I had never thought it was possible to feel this way, but there was no doubt in my mind I wanted her so badly, I couldn't believe I wasn't making an effort to stop it. "This is amazing, I just don't know how to do this."</p> <p>"I know." She smiled that knowing smile again. "This is totally awesome. And yes, it's totally different than what we have."</p> <p>I started to get up to get another bottle, but she leaned forward and whispered in my ear. "Wait, are you sure?"</p> <p>I could tell that I needed a response. I couldn't help but to look her in the eye. "Absolutely."</p> <p>"Good." Her eyes moved back to mine. "I've enjoyed your company, we really enjoyed ourselves, you know."</p> <p>"I'm glad... I'm sorry for that." I felt it was a bit more than that. "When I saw you out here naked, I couldn't resist."</p> <p>"I knew from what you looked like that you had a big cock." she said. She leaned forward and softly kissed my lips. My cock stirred in response. She stood up, took the wine glass from my hand, and walked back into the bedroom.</p> <p>"Come on. You said you'd like dessert, so we're going to enjoy dessert together!" With that, she picked the bedspread and sheet up from the floor and lay down on her stomach on the bed. I quickly put the wine glass back onto the dresser and stood off to one side of the bed. I watched the gorgeous creature in front of me. She was naked, but that didn't stop me. I slid into the bed next to her. My hand instinctively went to her waist. I felt her backside and let my hand slide up her front. I slipped my hand inside the elastic waist of her panties. I was surprised as I felt a small bush of pubic mounds and trimmed pubic hair. I couldn't believe how good her body was. Our skin touched and she sighed. I ran my finger down her front and around the front, up to her clit. She moved against my finger like a cat purring. I couldn't believe this was happening with this woman I hardly knew. Her breathing slowly started to come in short puffs. She started making small whimpers, she had to be able to take in that thing in me that much more. I felt her hips starting to rock against my hand. I let a finger slip into myself and was surprised to find she was still turned on at her pussy. I continued to stroke her clit with my finger and then slipped two of my fingers in her ass. This was an unexpected turn of events for me. She was so wet! It was a new sensation. She pulled me into the next room. We were both silent and just stood next to each other facing each other. "It's your turn now." she said in a sort of shy voice.</p> <p>I moved closer to her. "What? What's up?" She looked up at me, her eye-shadow was now slightly darkened, and she had dark brown shoulder-length hair. "No, it's just... we've never done this before... this is soooo naughty."</p> <p>I felt that I was in love.</p> <p>She pulled my body against hers as she turned her face towards me and softly kissed me on the lips. She moved our bodies slightly and rubbed my shaft with her body. I felt it, that was all it took for me to lose controlâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
