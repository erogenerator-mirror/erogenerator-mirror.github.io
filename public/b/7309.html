His soft hands gently stroked down her back and up to her shoulders. He bent down and pressed his lips to her neck and she shuddered as heat was slowly spreading from her body. The heat spread across her shoulders and down her arms down her belly to her hands until they were grasping his shoulders. She closed her eyes as his lips moved to her neck, kissing in a wet path from her ear down her neck, pausing at her navel and then over her mound, which is covered with curly black hair. He kissed her there and gently sucked on her nipple at the same time as he slid his finger inside of her, bringing moans and gasps from her mouth. They were both wetting around them, which made her even wetter. As he slid his finger in and out, she wrapped her fingers in the hair behind his head and pulled his face to hers and they kissed for a long time.</p> <p>He stood up and gently pressed against her lips. She smiled and opened her mouth, letting him put his tongue inside it, letting it swirl around it. She put her hands in his hair, pulling him down onto her and their heads touched as he moved the tip of his tongue to the corners of her mouth, sucking the lower part of her lip softly. He pressed his face to hers and felt her tongue pushing into his mouth. He put his hands under her arms and lifted her up and into a sitting position, and set her down in the middle of the futon with a soft slap on her ass. Then he walked down to the center of the futon, bent her over it, and looked closely at her body.</p> <p>Her skin was dark in the dim light cast by the bulb and her firm breasts stood straight up with the nipples pointing almost invitingly at him. He knelt down at her left hip and softly kissed the top as he kissed down her left thigh. She reached down and placed the palm of her hand against the wall near the other end of the futon, and the other hand rested on the futon behind her as he kissed her thigh and moved up to her mound. Her body shuddered and she groaned.</p> <p>I think you know what I want, my dear? To have your little pussy eaten. That's all you've got until I eat it. That's all a woman gets from a man. You know what I want. That's all. I was dreaming it." He kissed up her right leg to her left and licked from her knee toward her vulva. He licked around it, teasing it with his tongue as she groaned with delight. He kissed both legs, taking his time as he licked and kissed from her vagina slowly down to her anus and back up again, stopping there to kiss her lower belly.</p> <p>With a quick look up at her, he quickly ducked underneath the sheet to lick as his fingers slowly played along her labia, stopping at her clitoris, circling it. Her moans grew louder, she pulled her ass cheeks together, her eyes closed with a look of ecstasy on her face as she enjoyed the sensations. He continued down between her legs, his tongue moving between her inner lips. She felt the tip of him slide inside her, moving up her canal, slowly, and then gently sucking her clitoris into his mouth. Her thighs moved up and down as the walls of her pussy quivered against his tongue.</p> <p>"Mmmmm, that feels so good." She moaned, lifting her hips to grind it even more against his face. His fingers, his thumb, and his tongue, rubbing in a slow circle around her clit, working their way into her canal. He moved both hands into her to stroke as he circled her canal, pushing her down, lifting her onto his tongue, and then working back up to her clitoris. With each stroke, he took a little more of his tongue in her and she pushed back onto his face. She tasted wetness as she pulled his head hard against her. He could feel her body shuddering as she approached climax. He started sucking on her clitorus, feeling it respond to his touch. His hand went down to massage her mound as he continued his slow caresses, using his thumb for the first time in a couple months to bring her on.</p> <p>"Ohmigod, my pussy is going to come. Yes. Right there on my tongue. Right there in my mouth. Ahhhhhhh. Yes. Oh, that feels good." She was panting and shaking, and her face was flushed and shiny. He slid his right hand into her, stroking her g-spot as he worked his way on her clitoris. He felt her body shaking more as she worked against his mouth, her hips raising off of the futon.</p> <p>"Ohhhhhh. Oh yes, my love.
