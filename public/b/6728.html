Her voice faltered as she remembered what he was capable of, how he could be so wonderful, how he could make her feel like no other man ever had.</p> <p>"I'm not sure that I'm ready for that, too" Eric said, looking at his watch. "I promised to call on Monday to let you know which afternoon to meet up, but we can't get to it until the morning. I'm not sure how you feel after a little work today. The sex ... you know, when you're horny and horny are right. And you, after ... well, the two of us, anyway. And you've got that little body of yours, but I am not sure you are ready for that right now. But if you are, I can take you a little at a time."</p> <p>"Oh, okay... I guess."</p> <p>Her mind tried to find a way to change her mind. She needed to focus on the idea of Eric, as he was just a lover in her mind. But she didn't think that it could work. "I'm not sure if, when you get done with me, I'll be ready to go again. I guess that we'll just have to wait for it to happen."</p> <p>"Well," Eric replied, "that's fine, honey. I'll see what I can do to get that out of you for a little while, okay?"</p> <p>As soon as Eric had finished his coffee, he went over to the bedside and put her purse on the nightstand to put her phone number and a pen in it. It was there to show her when he called her for it, but then as soon as his phone was out of his hands and he had finished his coffee, he got back to the phone and wrote it down.</p> <p>"Hello?"</p> <p>"Hi Eric. It's Amanda. I'm so sorry for the call, I wanted to speak to you. Please give me your number and say hello. This is Amanda, I want to talk to you.
