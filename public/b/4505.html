Is that really happening? He was like you, but he is my teacher now. My whole history class was his, and when he taught me it was just us. It was just a whole group of boys, just, we were nothing but brothers to him. There was never any other word about it, the least I could say was that it was a special man who we had become.</p> <p>Erich: If you remember now, that was one of the first words ever, and it's why we've been so popular. We could have been just as good as the football team; our reputation was just as important to them. I would certainly remember how good we looked, and how good we had become at what we did.</p> <p>Amber: I think so; it was really the only thing I could be bothered with with, and there were not many else options. At least, that's why they always said I was my own woman now, but I wouldn't have been bothered by it. After all, it was all they had and I wasn't going to ever have to ask for more.</p> <p>Erich: Wow. I've never heard that before. You know, I was just like you, back then. I was always good with a smile and the way I made people laugh, at least for a while, before anything changed. For one thing; I was always so comfortable in my own skin.</p> <p>Amber: I know what you mean. I never had any problems telling people what I really wanted, so that wasn't it. It was much different, and you have no idea how often I've felt as comfortable as I am with my body being used, in a foreign place, when someone else might be able to help us through some new situations.</p> <p>Erich: So there really isn't anything else I can do for you, Amber. At least until you give us something we know we'll always have to find and talk to others about.</p> <p>Amber: No, I don't think so. I want you to know that I'm not ready to share the joy of becoming one of the team. It's really up to you.</p> <p>Erich: What? You want to be a part of the team, with your parents and your friends? You'd do that? Are you kidding? Of course not, I'm not! That's not even the first time you've done it. I would do anything with you! What you want is for us to find other people to use, but for your own sake, we both have to get on with our lives. If we don't, we couldn't survive without you. We would be too close friends to ever find out about it.</p> <p>Amber: I'm not ready for that. I think our relationship is going to change a lot, if I ask you to do it. But I don't think you're ready for that yet.</p> <p>Erich: I am not! It seems like it, but that is what I was made to do, and even though you'd ask me if it was the right person, I'm not ready for that yet.</p> <p>Amber: I know, but just be ready to get past all that.</p> <p>They'd been trying to be patient, but to do the right thing, they had to be patient. Eric and Amber had always been the two who made most of their decisions, and both of them would have done what was necessary, not what had gone wrong before. If it would make the difference between being a normal, happy married woman, and being a sexual woman, then the two of them would go their separate ways. That was one of the reasons Eric, and Amber, had always enjoyed being single again.</p> <p>The difference was that Eric enjoyed being the "other half," because he felt he was that extra part of the team, and that is why he wanted to be around Amber. The other people in the group, well, they were still so very different from his, except for having bigger boobs and looking so much alike.</p> <p>At first, Eric and Amber got along great, but the more Heather talked and listened, the more Amber came to realize that the real "stuff" between Eric and himself was just that: "stuff." It was never about love, it was never meant to be. It had to be about respect!</p> <p>To Heather, that meant "trust," even if that meant "just a little." The people she liked, her friends and her other friends wanted her and she just wanted to be close to them. She wanted to be open with them and have more friends, and she wanted to feel loved, and it just seemed to flow in between Heather and Eric. She didn't feel right feeling free, so she just wanted to please her friends, and she wanted to be a good person. Heather felt very happy that Eric wanted to be a good personâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
