"And as for me, I'm hoping that we can keep it quiet a bit, it's a bit of a mess."</p> <p>"Yeah but hey, lets play some more, lets have some rules. I can't imagine what you'll be willing to sacrifice." said Jane.</p> <p>Jack glanced down at his bulge and then back at her, "Are you saying that you wouldn't mind having me for dinner tonight?" he asked. "You know how it is these days, how much of a mess this place is and your husband is gone every night?"</p> <p>Jane laughed at his last remark, "Well I don't suppose we can just sit here drinking, do you have anything for the rest of the night." she said.</p> <p>"Oh, no not really, I suppose we could go up and sort some food out then. Why, do you have any sort of dessert?" asked Jack.</p> <p>"No, well maybe we could have a chocolate malt wine." Jane smiled. Jack took a sip of his beverage then said, "There's no rush. I'll just be waiting for you up at your place, why don't you call my mother and make her come up, I'll go and meet us down at our place. Then we can go out and hit the dance floor for a while."</p> <p>Jane got up and walked over to the waiter, she bent down and pulled his head up by his chin and kissed him. After they broke the kiss, she stood up and walked over to Jack, she put her mouth to his, and for a moment they were locked together in a fierce kiss. He then reached for her, pushed her away and said something in her ear. She laughed then said something in reply and pushed him away roughly.</p> <p>"Don't touch me or I'll have to do it myself and then you will never speak a word of this to your father ever!"</p> <p>Jack stepped back from Jane then, grabbed his drink and sat down on the sofa. He did not wait for her to come back over, he just sat there with his eyes closed. Jane walked over and sat down next to him and took his hands in hers.</p> <p>"You're right, you really are a mess." she said.</p> <p>Jane then kissed his cheek and stood up and went back to her bedroom. Jack thought, "That's how they do it sometimes" he thought. Jane then opened her bedroom door and walked back to where Jack was sitting. She pulled him up towards her and put his hands on her hips, turned and kissed him. At last, Jane broke the kiss, turned to Jack, undid his dress shirt and undid his zip and pulled it off. She stood back and started to feel him up, her fingers trailed down his tanned chest and stomach. Jack put his hands by his sides when Jane ran her hands over his shorts.</p> <p>"Oh!" he said, then reached down and grasped Jane's hand in a 'come-hither' moment of passion.</p> <p>"God, do you have a gorgeous body." said Jane, as she lifted her arms in the air. "And I really did like what I saw in the pictures of you with your mum. I could have stayed a while if I hadn't seen everything in the video."</p> <p>"You know it's very difficult to find a man who is as beautiful as you, but I think one has to have been looking for something." said Jack.</p> <p>"Well, thank you so much." said Jane, "I was actually looking to give this guy a blow job. I really liked it when you licked me. He wasn't all that big."</p> <p>"I like to surprise them by blowing them" said Jack. "It's hard to do if you are not up for it."</p> <p>Jane laughed again. "I know, very hard to do. Sometimes people just stick with what they know."</p> <p>"Now I think that I get it." said Jack as he sat down on the sofa and pulled Jane down onto him. He felt as if he had been tied to it. Jane pulled his tussled up dress up and his shirt off. She then moved her head between his legs and put her lips to his taut belly button. He felt as if this wasn't the first time she had had it done, and he had a bit of a problem, as if he could keep his mind from having sex with one of his girls. Jack looked down at Jane's head between his legs and saw her pink tongue probing the base of his cock. Jane then stopped, looked up at him with a sly smile.</p> <p>"You really seem to enjoy it." she said.</p> <p>Jack looked down into his lap, "I am not sure which makesâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
