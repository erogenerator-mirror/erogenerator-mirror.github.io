It sounds more like what you mean when you say you love me, but not mature," he chuckled?</p> <p>"I don't really care, baby, but you were making it hard for yourself, because I thought you were so hot..."</p> <p>"I'm just saying."</p> <p>"If I had gone to the gym I'd see you every day until you got your hair cut."</p> <p>"You haven't seen it," she smiled. "I like it on you. And as for why I love you, it was the only thing."</p> <p>"What do you mean?"</p> <p>"I love you too," she said. "I'm just not getting over the fact we haven't had sex yet. So, is it because you were just afraid it would scare me?" she smiled?</p> <p>"No, I didn't want you to think I was a slut," he replied. "It's not that way at all. I just need someone to love me."</p> <p>"How come you don't want to try, right now?" she asked, not sure he would have the nerve to ask her that one of all questions.</p> <p>"I want to be with you again as soon as I can," he answered. "I don't care if you try to pick me up or take me back tonight."</p> <p>"I don't, so I'm willing to wait," she smiled.</p> <p>"I love you," he said.</p> <p>"I love you, baby," she said. "There's nothing wrong with how I feel about you. I'm not judging you. I care about you. Do you love me, baby?"</p> <p>"Of course. I love you."</p> <p>"Then let's go to bed, and start planning the next step."</p> <p>"I can't have done a second day without having you in bed with me," he said and began getting undressed. "You are a beautiful vixen, and I hope I never get tired of being with you."</p> <p>He was already laying down on the bed, as she began to work her way down. When she was kneeling beside the bed, she reached out and wrapped her arms around his waist. "I love you," she said when she finally had her arms around him. She kissed his lips, then down to his breasts, which she kissed and licked for almost half of the second. When his cock was hard, it was nearly in her mouth. When she let him out, it was hard again. This time she wanted him in her mouth, but he wanted her to hold him.</p> <p>"What are doing?" he asked her. "This is so wrong, I'm married, I shouldn't be doing this."</p> <p>"It's not wrong," she smiled. "I'm just helping you out, so to speak."</p> <p>"I don't see why, but it sounds like something you would want to try, if you're willing. I mean, if you want to try something," he added. "You can stop me, I'll stop you, ok?"</p> <p>"Ok," she smiled. "I'll stop you, if you can't do something with it," she added. "It's not something I have to do if I don't want to, and I guess I could do that all night long."</p> <p>"Please don't stop," he moaned.</p> <p>She took his cock back into her mouth, and began working it in and out, and began sucking on it as she could. Her hand moved to his ball sack, and as much as he wanted to just go back with her, he couldn't; he wouldn't stop her at this point. He felt her tongue run right over his hard cock, while his hand roamed over her head, grabbing the sheets and pushing her face, toward it, while he groaned.</p> <p>She felt him swell, and knew he was about to cum. She pulled her mouth away from his cock, and got a look at his balls, which had a red mark forming there. She knew if she kept playing with his cock for a few more seconds, she would come without warning. She wanted to give him his orgasm. And she wanted to taste his cum as soon as it got out of his cock.</p> <p>"Ok," he said, lifting her up on the bed. He got between her legs, and as he lifted her legs, he put his cock at the opening of her wet pussy and began to enter her. He kissed her as the feeling, and the idea, became clear to them both. He wanted to start slow, not hurry, but she wanted himâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
