I'm getting off to thinking I might actually be in love.</p> <p>At that thought, I made a beeline to the kitchen and made myself a drink.</p> <p>I hadn't been very excited about the meeting yet, just a small hint of excitement but after my second drink, I realized I was a little bit on the raunchiest side.</p> <p>As I walked into the living room, I saw that there were at least two or three other women in the room, some of them laughing, others watching me through the window, others waiting for their drinks.</p> <p>In the far corner of the room, I saw them standing by one of the pool tables and another couple with him.</p> <p>It's going to be a little uncomfortable, they probably wouldn't have been able to watch me because I'm not a stranger to it and I'm not very drunk either.</p> <p>They're not bad looking.</p> <p>I don't know why I am nervous.</p> <p>I'm not sure who else in the room is watching us.</p> <p>They must have left.</p> <p>My heart is racing.</p> <p>I feel like I want to run to the bathroom and throw up.</p> <p>There are some other women sitting off to the side, obviously not watching us.</p> <p>The man is probably a construction worker.</p> <p>What's he doing there?</p> <p>There's that other woman by the pool and another couple.</p> <p>He's probably taking a swim.</p> <p>Maybe he'd like to join in.</p> <p>The woman at the table looks around at the other couple and smiles at me.</p> <p>Oh god, the sight of both of the woman's naked bodies is turning me on. I'm sure I'm wet and I want to feel that cock of his in me.</p> <p>"Is there anyone else here?" I ask.</p> <p>The two women at the table nod.</p> <p>This time, the woman I'd just seen walking toward me raises her glass.</p> <p>"To new friends," is her first response.</p> <p>"And to new friends."</p> <p>She places her glass on the kitchen counter with a flourish.</p> <p>Oh god, I want to run back to the table but all I can think is that it's going to be some serious fucking in front of this group.</p> <p>I turn back to the woman's face.</p> <p>"Are you sure this is alright with you?" I ask.</p> <p>She looks at me for several seconds as if trying to read my expression.</p> <p>"... yes."</p> <p>"It's not fine at the moment. We're going to leave now, now that we saw what we're waiting for."</p> <p>She's smiling now.</p> <p>I want to be crazy.</p> <p>The first woman at the table finishes off the other drink in her glass and places it down.</p> <p>"Are we going to play cards or something?" One of them asks.</p> <p>"I don't have a deck of playing cards," I tell them. "Just cards," I assure them.</p> <p>One of them smiles at me and nods.</p> <p>The woman at the table says, "I want to do more than just play."</p> <p>"Okay," she says to the other two "let's play cards."</p> <p>I take a sip of my drink.</p> <p>She takes three cards and moves around to where she's sitting.</p> <p>She's already to the far end of the table and the guy next to her is standing behind it.</p> <p>I'm going to be mad but not mad.</p> <p>I'm starting to feel more relaxed.</p> <p>She takes all three cards, puts one in front of the other two and takes them and removes them.</p> <p>I take a drink, but I don't mind it either. When she takes her top off, she stares at me as if asking the most obvious question, "Is this your deck of decks?"</p> <p>"I didn't play them."</p> <p>"It looks good!" she says to me and points to the deck.</p> <p>I look at the deck in front of me and take another drink, but this time I drink the remainder of my drink in one swallow.</p> <p>I look at it, too. I can't tell what it is I'm drinking but I know the color and the type of flavor and the size of the liquor so I don't care.</p> <p>I wonder if her nipples are hard and pointed. I see a dark circle under her bikini top. I take a sip of my drink.</p> <p>I smile to myself and think I'm imagining it.</p> <p>She's sitting next to me again.
