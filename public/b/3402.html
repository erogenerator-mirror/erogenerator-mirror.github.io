It certainly didn't go over well in some circles in some of the other campsites. It had certainly not gone over our heads and I don't think that either one of us really thought that at all. That and I was not one for a drink in the niceties of a local pub. So, we had a drink and a conversation and that was it. We were still at the pub when the evening finally came and we decided to be nice. We had had a few beers when we left the pub and had decided that we would hit the moon tonight and head back to camp.</p> <p>The moon was full, but it didn't stay full for very long. We had walked and drank another couple of beers before we got back to camp. We had sat there and had a few more beers and we were more than just a little drunk. Once again the night wasn't very good but the people at the camp had gone to town as soon as we set up camps so we didn't want things to get out of hand and we weren't worried if we got to do what we wanted with any of our campers either way. It was getting late in the night when we came here and we went ahead to camp and then got into bed. That was my idea and I fell asleep very quickly as a result.</p> <p>I couldn't decide what to do at first. I had been to the tent many times before and as far as I could remember the only person I had laid back on the bed had been Ann. This was a little strange because she'd had a light meal and drinks all night. If I had thought it odd I would say that I was sleeping on all fours and Ann was on her side looking to go to sleep in front of me. However, this didn't bother me at all, so I did it. We were spooning with her head on my right shoulder and both of her hands were going to work my cock as it was hard and waiting for her. I tried to make it last but it just couldn't seem to be happening and I wanted it as much as she did. I began to play with her tits more slowly even moving my hand down to the hem of her skirt.</p> <p>"I don't want to be the only one that is awake now," Ann said sleepily to me and as she whispered I rolled over to go to sleep myself.</p> <p>It was the perfect first night sleeping outside the tent because I woke up a little earlier and the night hadn't really gotten a lot darker. I wasn't sure if Ann heard me as I came in to bed or that I was still snoring as I went to the bathroom. I came out of the bathroom to find Ann in the same outfit as the night before. She had on the top of a short white negligee and a white robe on underneath. I thought she was going to be a little bit silly when I said that she should go get her things and go get ready as I was getting some beer and we were heading to bed.</p> <p>"Here we go again" Ann said as she came over and gently pulled me over to put my hand on her knee while she got up. She took her jacket and put it around me as she did so. She kissed me and then she reached behind me to unhook my robe and pull it off. She looked into my eyes and said "Now what is this," as she moved her hands up between my legs, toying with my cock which was hard and waiting for her.</p> <p>"I think you know what I need right now," was all I could answer as she got to her knees in front of me.</p> <p>I felt her soft hair as she brushed it around my cock and then she put the head in her mouth and began to suck it as she began to suck more firmly on me. It wasn't unusual for her to lick me before but this night was different this time as it was my first one I was sure of. It was the first time having two people do it. She had a good technique and I was enjoying it more and more. I looked over to see her breasts swinging over me and then I saw her hands move down to her crotch and move between her legs. The whole time she continued to lick me she continued to put her hands between her legs and massage her clit. It had been a while, and I didn't get to see the first time in as I was still lying down. Now I could watch her as she was taking me in and out of her mouth.</p> <p>It was at that point that I felt my orgasm start to start. I looked down to see Ann's head move up and down as she took more and more of me in her mouth. I began to get louder which increased the sensations that were coming from her mouth. It didn't takeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
