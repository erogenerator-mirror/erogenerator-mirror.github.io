I can't kill her with a knife! You should see that she didn't have to die."</p> <p>"Maybe I shouldn't have killed her."</p> <p>"I don't think so. She was so beautiful the last time we got together."</p> <p>"But that's just it. I got to have her! I have to have her!"</p> <p>She put her gun down again and I felt the knife slide into my chest. I had no idea she had the knife ready.</p> <p>"Are you sure I can keep it?"</p> <p>"I'll keep it," she said and turned to go back to her place. That's when I heard the door to her house and saw it going up. "Where do the men go when they get home and watch?" I yelled.</p> <p>"Your wife? When I got home this was all for show. They had their own parties and did a lot of drinking. You had to wait. He could have taken care of me and it would not have seemed so."</p> <p>"That just made me want to die. I just had to make love to you or let you see me. What do you say."</p> <p>"Do it or I won't let you ever let you near my woman again." I said as I ran to the bedroom. I couldn't believe the knife was still in my chest.</p> <p>"Maybe you should have killed her."</p> <p>"I don't think so. If she survives you can."</p> <p>"Why her? You didn't kill her."</p> <p>"I don't know. I guess some people don't like living that long. We can come back whenever."</p> <p>I opened the bedroom door again so we could watch the action. I had two of the men in the bedroom with my wife. She lay on her back on the bed. Two of the men had their pants and underwear down around their knees. I watched as my wife sucked two dicks while they alternated between her legs. After a few seconds of watching her I walked out with the knife sticking out of my chest. I watched as the other man stepped forward to have my wife's lips wrapped around him.</p> <p>I came back to the bed and grabbed the knife and pointed it at my wife's heart. What was that all about. She was getting raped and had been. I put the blade down and waited for the men's laughter to get loud. Then I started to get angrier with him. I got on the bed next to her and ran the knife up along her cheek.</p> <p>There was an instant of silence. Then there was a sudden jerk of what felt like a rope, as if a big branch had been thrown at me. I stopped. I heard the man's gasp, as I put the knife down but still couldn't move my arms without trying to get out the knife.</p> <p>"You have to let the other woman fuck you too," the man said.</p> <p>"But she has an audience!"</p> <p>"Yes!"</p> <p>I had to stand up so I would walk across the street with the knife and take them in hand once they were taken away. I turned the knife over and held it to my chest while I tried to calm down from the events of the night. She had killed two men, the only one I had the knife with. And now she had an audience to watch me fuck another woman!</p> <p>They came back. One had a knife in his mouth while the other lay there holding a knife on one of his legs. He pulled the knife away, while I watched. At the same time, my other arm started to move against my chest to try to stop the hands that were holding the knife. I could see what was happening to my wife when she was being raped. She was being pulled away and I could see what was happening. The man must have been holding the knife as well.</p> <p>The man who was holding the knife was trying to say something and didn't have the words. Then he started to laugh as he fell over her. She opened her eyes while lying on the bed. The man on the floor was laughing and she looked over at him. It was hard not to notice his laughter, when it came to my wife. I didn't want to watch all of it. My wife was trying to move her limbs. He must have been having an orgasm while she tried to hold the knife.</p> <p>What could I do? I just stood there in a way that was no excuse, just watching the woman lying on the bed. I didn't think she was going to be ableâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
