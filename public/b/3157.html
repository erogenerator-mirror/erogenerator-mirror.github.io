I thought it was only fair if I got to taste her," I said, blushing.</p> <p>"Honey, please don't be ashamed of yourself. I just found out that you had an extremely beautiful, shapely, woman... beautiful. And it was a gift that I've been trying to share... not just from myself."</p> <p>"You are so gorgeous... I'm surprised it took you to a shrink to help me find it out... I always thought I might be hiding my real life behind this mask. I mean it's a little embarrassing to think that I'm actually a woman that's attracted to you... is it?" I joked, a little bit nervously.</p> <p>"It's a long and complicated story... so don't worry..." he chuckled.</p> <p>This entire conversation had left me in an uncomfortable state, and I felt so awkward... I had started to get warm all over and my nipples were very erect. I looked around for something that would help me with this embarrassing situation. I looked up at Mr. Marcus and saw him standing on the other side of the room. He was looking a little uncertain.</p> <p>'Mr. Marcus, what are you doing here??" I spoke to him, looking him straight in the eye.</p> <p>"I came over to let you know... I think you already know this is Mr. Marcus, right?" I replied him, trying to ease his fears away.</p> <p>"Yes, I guess so," he said.</p> <p>"Why do you still want to come to see me?" I asked him nervously.</p> <p>"Well... thank you for saving my life," Mr. Marcus replied, with a soft laugh on his lips.</p> <p>"Oh, I'm so sorry... I was afraid you wouldn't approve of me." I whispered to him, and he could see the worry in my voice.</p> <p>"We will definitely still be friends, honey," he said, returning to the task at hand.</p> <p>"So... what happens with our next meeting tomorrow?" I asked him, looking up from my work.</p> <p>"After your last appointment... I've just been thinking that he wants to be your first client at my apartment... He's so beautiful... he is very sexy, isn't he... I always wished I were as sexy as my brother," he said, shaking his head.</p> <p>"Wow... You are a sexy man," I cooed, smiling up at him.</p> <p>"I'm not really that sexy... I just don't feel that sexy every time I'm with a man... you know how I'm getting... He's making me feel good today... Oh... look at him... he's getting all worked up for you," he said to me, putting his hand on my thigh...</p> <p>"Is he sexy, too?" I asked him, smiling and putting my head on his shoulder.</p> <p>"Yeah... he's hot... he's so sexy I can't help myself," he said, looking into my eyes again.</p> <p>"Maybe we should just do this the way we normally do it... we've been doing this for years." I said to him, looking into his dark brown eyes again.</p> <p>"Yes, I agree... I just wish we could do it now, but I think we should finish what we've started as soon as possible... do you understand?" he asked me, putting his hands on my lower back.</p> <p>"No... thank you for the offer... that was a lot of work," I replied, feeling a little bit shy with the way that he was being so tender.</p> <p>"I know you are a little shy, but your life would never really change. I know lots of men that would love to get into your pants... and I would be honored to be your first client, if that is what you really want," he said, his hands starting to move slowly...</p> <p>"Well, that just means so many good things for both of us... I guess I could use it," I said with confidence, putting my feet down, and placing my hands on his shoulders.</p> <p>"Oh, that's a good idea. Let's get this meeting started. And as soon as you find a room that I'll be happy to escort that little slut up to my studio... I don't want to get you a little dirty," he said, leaning down to kiss me.</p> <p>It was a kiss full of promise not only from him, but also from me as well. It was a kiss full of promise... one that would be followed many more times and then we would have lots of fun.</p> <p>"I've been anticipating this for a long time, and I can't even begin to imagine what you have up your sleeve for me and for me..." he said back to me as our lips meet.</p> <p>"Wellâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
