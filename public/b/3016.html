There was a bar and we weren't in the living room of the main bedroom. I poured myself another drink, sipped at the water, and returned to the living room, and turned on the lamp. I turned down the lights, then sat down with a drink in my hand and sipped at it thirstily as I gazed across at the couple on the couch. My wife was seated, a large glass of wine in her hand and one arm draped across her husband's leg, the other wrapped loosely around his waist. She looked beautiful, her hair pulled back with just a few curls falling across her brow. She had her fingers caressing and fondling his face as she watched me intently through tear-filled eyes.</p> <p>She leaned forward and kissed him, then leaned back and said, "Thank-you for everything, Tim." A very brief pause, and then she looked at me, "Let's just enjoy the rest of the evening, shall we?"</p> <p>I reached for my glass, then drank deeply and placed the glass next to mine on the coffee table. I watched my wife's lips as she leaned over him, her nipples grazing the fabric of her bikini top. The sight of her tits pressed against her husband's bare chest must have set off his erection. I reached for the glass and drained it, then held it out for a refill. I looked her in the eye as I returned to my chair, my mouth slightly agape and a look of amazement and wonder in her eyes. I knew that the night was drawing to an end, but I couldn't help but think that I would be doing well to keep this at the level I could get from where it had been, regardless of what she or anyone else knew.</p> <p>The next few hours were filled with discussion with the girls and various activities in the bedroom. It was clear that the evening was developing more and more into a night of sexual exploration. After a while, I decided that, after what felt like an hour or more, I should retire for the evening. I stood and slowly stepped out of the room and walked to the door. Turning to the door, I said softly as I reached it, "There's one more thing."</p> <p>My wife's reply surprised me, as she quickly turned on her heel and headed for the other end of the hallway. Once again, she leaned over and kissed him, then said, "I don't think you're going to get any sleep tonight, Tim, let's go into the guest room." My wife stood, walked across to me, turned her back to me and leaned over my shoulder.</p> <p>Breaking away from the hug she wrapped her arms around my neck and pulled me down to her lips. She kissed me long and passionately as she slid her tongue between my lips and brushed her fingertips against my body, then she broke the kiss again as she stood up and walked towards the door. Her arm went around my waist as she said, "Let's go to bed. I feel like a new person." She stepped out of the hallway and locked the door, then turned on the light as she walked towards her bedroom. Once in the bedroom, she sat at the dressing table, poured herself some wine, and then lay back against the headboard and closed her eyes. "Oh, honey, you do know that what you like so much, you just have to ask me how I feel. It's like I live in a dream."</p> <p>I stood and poured myself one more shot of Scotch before getting in the shower and getting out of bed while she remained at the other end of the bed, listening to me showering. After I finished, I opened the bathroom door to see that my bride was dressed in a matching skimpy one-piece swimsuit. As my eyes adjusted to the daylight, I realized that my wife looked fabulous, so I got dressed. I don't really know what to make of this, but I felt a tingle in my groin, as I realized that it probably took an arm or two for me to get fully erect. I stepped to the shower door and turned it on. It was quite a surprise, as my eyes closed slowly, until I heard her begin to moan.</p> <p>I turned off the water, then reached down and gently pulled my cock toward the glass door. As I held it to the air, my wife began to rub the sides of her breasts. She turned her head to look at me over her shoulder, then pulled her legs out to the side and placed her hands on the glass door. Turning to the left, I opened the shower door enough to reach for the door handle. She stopped me as I stepped out first, then quickly walked back under the showerheadâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
