I grabbed the towel from the floor and wiped my face and body. I could hear his breathing quicken. Just then he said, "My turn now." He turned around and sat on the edge of the tub, facing me. As he finished and climbed out, my eyes went back to the front door. The door was open, but the lights were off. He walked towards me, stood in front of me, and lowered his pants. His cock was hard and thick again. He walked in front of me, and without warning I put his cock in my mouth. His cock was warm and hard. I felt him push in to the back of my throat. He held me to it until he came. I didn't want to stop until the sun woke me up. He took his cock out of my mouth and started to kiss me. I kissed back and we started to feel each others tongues. I kept kissing him.</p> <p>He pulled back and said, "I want to see your ass." I had been so caught up in kissing him. I reached back and spread my cheeks. He smiled and said, "Let me see that ass."</p> <p>I turned around and put my hands on my thighs. I spread my ass cheeks wide. I held my cheeks together and looked back at him. He walked over to his bag and opened it. I saw the vibrator, already coated with lube. "Do you want to lube it up for me?"</p> <p>He pulled a tube of lube and handed it to me. He walked around me. I watched in wonder as he put lube in his hands and started to rub his hands up and down my ass. I spread my legs as far apart as I could without him seeing. When he turned around and sat beside me, his cock was back up inside me. I bent in back and rested my head on his thigh. I was still in the water. He lifted my legs above my head. I was sitting on the tile. He took his cock out and pressed it against my ass hole. I gasped as he pushed in further than he had before. He pulled back and then pushed in again. I pushed back to meet him. His hands were on my stomach. "You are so fucking tight. You are so beautiful." I let his arms rest on my hips and watched him slowly fuck me. We fucked each other for a few minutes more. As he pulled out, he took off the head of the vibrator, and put it in my ass. He pushed it in and I felt something. My body jerked as another orgasm exploded through me. His cock wasn't in me at all. The head of his cock was inside me. I moaned louder. The vibrations of the vibrating and his cock filling my ass made me cum again. His cum was still in me. He pushed back in and began to fuck me again. I knew when I felt his cock pushing me open.</p> <p>"You have such a nice sexy ass," he said as he continued to fuck me. The feel of my ass had me so turned on I could cum again. I screamed and I could feel his hand on my ass pushing me back into him. I knew he would cum again.</p> <p>He pushed me back against the tile. He pulled his cock out after he was done. He turned around and we kissed. When he was done kissing me, he looked into my eyes and said, "Now it is your turn. We do it again next week." They were in my bathroomâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
