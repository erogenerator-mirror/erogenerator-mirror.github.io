She began to disrobe, tossing her bag to the side.</p> <p>"I don't know about that, I am afraid I may never get those images out of my head."</p> <p>"My goodness," I said softly, "you look so exquisite in those pictures."</p> <p>She slid the robe up her body, revealing her smooth, dark pubic hair. I took in her beautiful skin, her full breasts, the hard, erect pink nipples poking out, her stomach just below her navel, her hips curved slightly towards her thighs. Her pussy was neatly trimmed, her outer labia not a speck of hair but nicely trimmed.</p> <p>She stood in front of me, her skin a light, almost golden-brown/golden, with a little pink to it, giving it a glossy, sexy look. Her body was slim but toned, her hips narrow and fit her body well, her stomach taut and flat, her breasts full and firm, topped by a small pink areola.</p> <p>Her face was sweet without being arrogant. She stepped closer to me, our fingers entwined, our lips meeting softly; I could taste a hint of her lipstick on her lips. She pressed her body towards me, our legs intertwined. Our lips met, our tongues seeking out each other. Our mouths molded and probed each other, our tongues and saliva moving together. Tongues explored, our mouths opened and wet. She broke the kiss, smiling. We held each other's hands, our legs moving together, our breasts rubbing against each other and we broke our contact.</p> <p>"You have beautiful breasts. I would love to kiss it."</p> <p>She leaned back, spreading her thighs wide, her pussy already glistening with wetness, her inner lips glistening in the light. "You like?" she asked</p> <p>"Mmm," I replied, licking my lips, still looking at her and wondering what to do.</p> <p>"That's the thing," She said as her hand trailed down her tummy to her pubic mound, her fingers parting her labia, exposing the soft flesh. They dipped inside, her index and middle finger sliding over her soft folds. Her eyes closed and her mouth fell open. "Is that a finger," she asked. "Yes," I replied, "you are making me so wet."</p> <p>"Oh, it's soo nice," She replied, her legs parting wider and pulling her lips apart. "Soo beautiful."</p> <p>"It's not going to stop there," I said, "and you're soaking right now. Do you like what you see?"</p> <p>"Oh, yes, it's beautiful."</p> <p>"Is this what you want?" She asked, her voice husky.</p> <p>"Oh yes." My voice sounded too deep. "God, it's so beautiful." I slid my fingers in and out of her vagina, pushing them in up against my stomach, her outer labia spreading to meet them, my thumbs caressing her inner lips, pulling on them, my tongue licking her pussy and my fingers fucking her.</p> <p>"My god," I said, "you're so wet."</p> <p>"Is that when you want this?" She asked as she pushed my chest towards her face.</p> <p>I nodded, pressing my fingers inside her, pushing my thumb in and out, stroking her clitoris and then rubbing her G spot.</p> <p>"Tell me," She said, opening her eyes to look at me, "tell me how much you want this."</p> <p>"I want this," I said, "I want you to put that thing in me right now."</p> <p>She reached over and squeezed her right breast then her left, her nipple still hard and pointed at me. Her breasts were large and full, her right breast the size of a ripe grape. The areola was dark reddish brown, her nipple swollen and protruding, the size of a large pencil eraser.</p> <p>She placed her hands on her thighs, pulling her pubes back and down across her abdomen, her labia still stretched, her outer lips spread in anticipation.</p> <p>"I want you in me," I said, "I want to feel you. I want to taste you."</p> <p>"Don't you dare," She said, her body moving closer, her thighs brushing mine.</p> <p>My thumb rubbed her nipples, rubbing between them, moving slowly over them. I moved my hand up her stomach and over her clit, stroking her, rubbing her as she ground her hips, pushing back at me. My fingers pressed against her clitoris, pressing the hood back, exposing the tiny bud. She opened her legs wider and I rubbed her slowly, rubbing her everywhere I could reachâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
