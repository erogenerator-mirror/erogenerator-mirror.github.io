I put that on the album of your birthday."</p> <p>"But why?"</p> <p>"Because at times I don't feel as close to you as I did from the beginning, and I think it would be very difficult for us to meet on another day when you are so much older."</p> <p>I hugged him again, this time to let him know the good thing about me was that it didn't hurt what we had, but that in return if I got on his boat, it was more than that. The memory of our kiss in the parking lot didn't seem to hurt either.</p> <p>As the evening came to an end and we left to head towards home, he said that he would like to bring a swimsuit for our last day in Sydney, but as he'd only asked, I didn't mind.</p> <p>I had had a couple of weeks' worth of swimming, and I didn't need a swimsuit just to have a chance to unwind the following week. I'd just decided I could go out with Peter, and for the next couple of days we would just go to the same pub, have a meal and a drink and then watch television together, but until then I'd like to go home with him before dinner.</p> <p>I was determined to see if there was anything that I could say that would help put a positive spin on our relationship, and when he came to work with something that looked and sounded really good. For some reason I didn't expect to find anything that he was, but it didn't seem too far away, and my own fears were not easily ignored, as he did all very well.</p> <p>We spent some time on the couch and sat around looking at each other a bit. He asked a question about me, and when I answered and said that I had met a guy, he asked what a good looking guy was like. He asked about my interests. This seemed to ease my worries so I explained a bit more about myself.</p> <p>He looked me straight in the eye as he said that I was not a young beauty like some of the women I had previously dated, but I was obviously very attractive. He asked whether I would go out with him, and I hesitated. Then he said that I would just have to go and put on a suit, and then he would come for me. He asked if I was really sure about it, and when I said that I really wouldn't even consider doing that, he said I really needed to be ready to do some shopping if I was going to go out with him, and so I replied that I was, and he continued.</p> <p>"And what about other people we might meet in a similar way?"</p> <p>I paused only to see how he thought I would react. "I don't want to take advantage of you," was all I could think of to say. "But you are so special,"</p> <p>he said, "and I must be at least eight inches taller than you."</p> <p>I didn't say anything. I thought he was going to take my words to heart, that is exactly what I felt, but then I thought he was just playing it to show me his appreciation of my beauty.</p> <p>His face looked very happy as he asked me which clothes I had, I said yes, and we got dressed in his BMW, and headed back down to the city. Just after lunch I saw him at the same place he had been the day before. We stood up without a word, we went through to his BMW, and he put his hand inside my jacket as we were closing the door. I told him that I hoped we would see each other again when we were here again.</p> <p>"Not so soon," as he kissed me on the lips.</p> <p>"I'm afraid not, but I also want to spend some time with you, to thank you for a wonderful afternoon. Can we?" And as he said that, he took my hand and kissed it.</p> <p>"I'm sure that will be OK, you are very beautiful, and the wine is excellent."</p> <p>"It's not wine, it is your body, and I'm sure you are not the only person with whom you should be having pleasant thoughts."</p> <p>It might have been a lie, but we were, and we were having a good time.</p> <p>One evening I had taken off my jacket to go get my suit which contained a white blouse and a black skirt. He came up to me as I was fixing up my make-up and said that he would like to go to a nightclub in the evening.</p> <p>"I would like that"</p> <p>"Good, because it could be a very interesting evening. We could sit talking and have a few drinks, and maybeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
