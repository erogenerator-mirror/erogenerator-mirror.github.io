Sam asked, "Am I interrupting anything?" he added grinning. Sam couldn't help but notice that he was in a really good mood, though he wasn't as good looking as the woman. In fact, she had a reputation around the neighborhood as one of the prettiest, most beautiful and beautiful of all. It was a shame she'd turned up at all these men's doors looking so sexy.</p> <p>"I'm a married woman," she said with a blush, "and I'm not even going to be able to leave my husband, Mr B..." she stopped, realizing she was talking about herself, "...Mr B. If I don't take my man home..." she looked at her watch, "he'll be worried for himself," she started.</p> <p>The door burst open and two guys walked in with the first guy standing there looking concerned. The one next to him was very thin, maybe even taller, and black. If Sam had ever had a black dick, she wondered why they would have gone with it. The other two guys just stood there with their mouths hanging open but not saying a word. Both were about six feet tall and built like they used to run. Sam almost wished she had two of those hips, a perfect hourglass, as they all did.</p> <p>"So, what did you expect, Mr B?" A guy in the front of the room asked him, "I guess you didn't mind what you thought you were going to watch."</p> <p>"No. He's fine, really. But how can..." He didn't even get to finish.</p> <p>"Now, now, Mr B," a voice said in his ear, "I know what you're really worried about." The other guy took up a defensive stance, and Sam was shocked as the door closed, with two steps.</p> <p>"What am I going to do?"</p> <p>"You go home; I will take care of everything for you," the voice said, "That's it," the voice said again. Sam didn't move, not yet, he just stood for a moment. He looked at her, and her eyes were almost pleading with him, "Please tell me what to do," he said. Sam just said that, with her eyes staring down at him. That's all he needed. Sam took his hand, looking deep in his eyes, "I beg you, please tell me what to do," he said.</p> <p>Sam wasn't able to answer him at first, just dropped to her knees.</p> <p>Sam's mind was reeling. This felt wrong, but she knew she had to do it, she had to do it for herself, for the guy standing up. If she went home and did it, all the better, because she wasn't going to cheat on her husband. She reached up with the back of her head, trying to reach to touch it, but as always, the fabric didn't seem to be working.</p> <p>Sam knew he had a bigger dick than the other guy, so she had to do it, just to try. She closed her eyes a moment, not even thinking about it. She could feel the pressure of the hands on her head, moving her face down his cock, and he was moving it up and down in his mind, guiding it, sliding it past her pursed lips, into her mouth. The thought made Sam hot all over. She could feel the head press into her throat as it slid down until she almost gagged, and when she opened her eyes, she saw him looking down at her.</p> <p>"That's it, baby. You suck that big cock good," he whispered, "and you'll love it. God, you're such an innocent, innocent little wife." Sam felt that horrible guilt again, her mouth full of cock, but she didn't care anymore, she wanted him to give her the ride of her life. Sam took his cock out of her mouth and looked back at the guy standing there, looking at her. Sam had to look at the guy again, and he was pointing at her, and she realized that he was looking at her in her own eyes. Then she saw what he was looking at and she looked back at him and felt her stomach drop, her heart begin to pound.</p> <p>Sam saw the guy moving his cock to her lips and heard him say, "Oh my God," as he stared. What was Sam thinking, she was going to kiss this guy? He was staring down at her in shock, she was so nervous. It turned her on a little, knowing that, as she always did, she could have this kind of control over men. Sam couldn't help thinking about doing it, as she reached for his cock and began to stroke it, she pulled him in with her hands and looked up at him as she did, "Oh, oh, I love it," she gasped, and then licked her lips and grinnedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
