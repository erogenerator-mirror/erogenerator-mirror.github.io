Her eyes snapped in and out as she brought him down, holding him close to her. She held him while he cried against her neck.</p> <p>"I'm not giving up." He said softly after pulling away after several minutes.</p> <p>"That hurts." She whispered in his ear, looking up into his face for a response. "There are ways to go about hurting someone."</p> <p>"How?" He wanted her to see him so wrong, but she hadn't asked, so she had no right asking for that.</p> <p>"Well," she kissed him, "that's up to you, but I'm pretty sure going to take care of you. I really need to do something for you, too."</p> <p>"I don't need you any more." He said softly, "I really can get used to it." "That's ok." Then she laughed as she leaned back on the couch, leaving him holding his head to the side. "That was nice."</p> <p>"It was?"</p> <p>"Yes." She was still smiling, "I'm not sure it's that I'm ready for sex right now. I was hoping and hoping..."</p> <p>"Maybe." His lips brushed against hers, "I'm glad we can... get together."</p> <p>"I don't think it's for that." She kissed him for a few moments. "I want you to be there for me."</p> <p>"I've thought about it a lot." he smiled, "And I want us to get together."</p> <p>She smiled, "I think it's a great idea."</p> <p>"So you're okay with this?" he grinned a little too eager.</p> <p>"I'm not done yet." She giggled once more.</p> <p>"This is a lot more than I dreamed it would be. Hell, I'm more willing to have another man in me."</p> <p>"You're pretty crazy." She smiled again. She didn't really have the heart to say it in a way, but it was true. It was how they fit in and there was something she couldn't have a moment later. He wasn't really sure if what she said, or if it was the best thing he'd ever heard, so he decided to play his cards as best as he could.</p> <p>"So am I?" he kissed her temple, "if you don't mind?"</p> <p>She giggled again and he didn't know if that was a good or bad thing. "If I'm good, do you mind?"</p> <p>"I'd like that."</p> <p>"Good."</p> <p>He sat up and walked over to the mantle and reached into the box to pull out two red cards he'd already been using. When he finished them, he set the cards down on the coffee table and held his arms open.</p> <p>It was a beautiful morning, not even a fog had arrived with the sun beating down on them, the sky was sparkling in the early light. His eyes widened when they looked to the right, she stood by the windows again to let some shade out, although no one really had anything on. And the wind was still warm, even though it wasn't really cold right now. He couldn't say for sure if she had been wearing a jacket, but she probably didn't feel that wind. The sun was high in the sky which meant she was either wearing it or not.</p> <p>He was about to say something when she said, "Are you ready for another round?"</p> <p>"Yup."</p> <p>"Then let's start. When I'm good and ready, you don't have to worry about anything." She giggled again and he knew that she was probably right. There was no way he thought she would ever consider having another man there, as long as she didn't think she'd ever consider using those words again. He looked out the window and she was grinning again.</p> <p>"Maybe I will." He sighed, "I'm ready, but, I'll still have to do some last minute maintenance."</p> <p>"Don't I have a say in the matter?"</p> <p>"Oh yeah, but before we go, I need to ask you if you're ready for something. And, if you are, then I'm ready." He smiled.</p> <p>"Ok." She stood up on her toes and kissed him.</p> <p>She had never kissed him like that before, not yet, although he'd enjoyed her. There was something else about the way she was holding him, just as he always had, and she did it with no reservations. His hands were on her hips as they met to kiss, but as she leaned back, their lips came together in a long, slow, full-bodied kiss.</p> <p>She pulled away whenâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
