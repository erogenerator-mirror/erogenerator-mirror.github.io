"We're not taking you down to the parking lot."</p> <p>Mason looked a bit crestfallen. He was still trying to figure it all out. Of course he would be the last to admit it. He was just as much a stranger to her in the flesh as he was to him in the back of the limo. She was far too young and fragile to be taken seriously like that in a vehicle or in the company of someone like him.</p> <p>Not anymore, in a sense. Mason thought back to all the times she'd tried to convince herself that this was the way it was going to be. She'd said that he couldn't really tell the difference between being inside the vehicle and being outside the vehicle. But it was the truth. He supposed that's what happened between them, the sort of thing that really hurt, maybe even broke, though it would certainly make it better if he had just been there to give her her chance.</p> <p>But he wasn't taking her down to the restaurant, just as they wanted to.</p> <p>"Mason," she said. "I'm sorry. I'm not sure how this can possibly feel like a good relationship."</p> <p>He didn't have to be concerned, not if she was trying to start the conversation he might say no.</p> <p>"Well..." he said. "I'm in your debt, right?"</p> <p>He didn't know how to start with that. He couldn't help himself. "I don't know what I'm thinking," he said. "You're not the type of girl that comes up to me and says that I'm an asshole or something. It would be really, really hard not to think about that. But, you have to get that on the date."</p> <p>"I...uh...would have to think about it some time."</p> <p>This sounded ridiculous to him. But why not take matters into his own hands? And he hadn't even considered that he could possibly say this to her. "No, I think it's time for me to get out of here," Mason said with a chuckle. "There's a lot of things you're not going to like here. And I have a feeling that most of them are the product of what you thought of me. But I just couldn't take you to the other side of the coin."</p> <p>He smiled and walked away from her.</p> <p>"You know what, man, I think it's time I got out of here too. Or should I just stay and think it over." He thought it over for a few seconds. "I guess I'd better get back. I don't want to be involved in any of that conversation."</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>Mason got back to the limo and sat down in a recliner seat. He sat there for a moment and then got out of his seat and left it unplugged. He grabbed his suit case and his suitcase and was going to walk out and get his passport and to his personal security. He would come to a hotel as soon as he was sure that he was not going to run into any of his clients. He was sure that they would ask about the time stamp on that particular envelope. He wouldn't even mention it if he was not sure that he would ever look it up. It would be a lie that he didn't plan to look any of these things up any time soon...and he didn't want that to happen with his clients now.</p> <p>He looked at the clock. 1/2 an hour. That way I can go back to where my life started and go on another date and see what unfolds.</p> <p>"Mason," a deep voice called out from the driver's seat. He looked up at the driver's window for a moment, then nodded.</p> <p>"Yes?"</p> <p>"I think I'm going to like you there."</p> <p>Mason turned around. He was still looking out at the dark parking lot where the other driver was still in his car. That wouldn't be an inconvenience to him. He'd have to sit a bit by the window and be sure to turn as soon as he was. After all of that was going on in his mind. He hadn't expected anything to happen today. He had been feeling a little apprehensive about what to do, about this meeting, about any sort of commitment that he would have with this woman. He could still feel how nervous she had been. He could still feel the pain in her eyes as he had.</p> <p>His shoulders were still shaking as he reached back and pulled on his seat belt. He had an almost painful look on his face again. He turned his head and looked at the other driver, wondering what he was going to say to her. He hadn't even realized that someone had done it to him. Hadn't she already seen him that way?</p> <p>"Whatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
