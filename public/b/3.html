Maybe tomorrow morning to meet him."</p> <p>"I'm sure he'll show you what a big one he is and it'll be wonderful."</p> <p>"Well you never know. I'll have to look him over some day and work out some ways to get your cock down. I'm sure you have better equipment now."</p> <p>It was all I could do to suppress a chuckle as I walked back to the desk.</p> <p>I found Bob, "Are you ready," I said, looking over at the clock on the desk.</p> <p>"Yup, I'm ready," he said. He was sitting on the sofa and I went to sit next to him.</p> <p>"Well, maybe you better get up and get something to eat, while I go get some paper and some glasses," I said.</p> <p>"No really, you have the room all to yourself, I can do that. Do you mind if I take a shower while I work?"</p> <p>"No of course not, you can do as you're told," I said.</p> <p>I got a shower, put on some clothes, packed everything, and got to work.</p> <p>As I walked into the front lobby, I saw a tall guy who had just come from the coffee shop. I took my time getting off the elevator and as I walked up to meet him, the room next to mine opened just a crack on one wall.</p> <p>He shook my hand and said, "Gentleman, welcome to the apartment!"</p> <p>"Yup, I'm Dave" I said, shaking hands.</p> <p>"You seem to be looking around all day, if you'd like to join me, I'd be happy," he said with a big smile.</p> <p>"I've got nothing, I was just on my way back here, to give Jim a call," he said. "What say we finish lunch first, since I don't seem interested in talking," he said with a smile.</p> <p>"Let's go," I said. We walked out to my car and took off.</p> <p>"I would love to," he said, "My car is a little better, so don't worry. I'll call you tomorrow morning."</p> <p>"No problem. See you tomorrow," I said, as I closed the door.</p> <p>"Thanks for everything," he said. "Next time, please come hang out with me some more."</p> <p>"I will," I said as I got in my car and drove off. I got home and saw that Jim and I had a late breakfast.</p> <p>When I got to the apartment that night, Jim was sitting on the couch watching TV when I walked in.</p> <p>"Hey girl, what do you think?" I said, kissing him lightly on the cheek and looking over at the television. He didn't stir or say a word. But I knew from earlier that he liked how I looked.</p> <p>"Wow, you look amazing," he said softly.</p> <p>"You know that I can't wait until tomorrow," I said.</p> <p>"So, when did you get home from the office?" he asked.</p> <p>"About an hour ago. I just got up and came by to say hi. You have one more place to go," I said.</p> <p>"And did you see how excited you brought me?" he said.</p> <p>"Oh yes, I did. You can say that I wanted to meet you for lunch. Would you like to go out?" I asked.</p> <p>He agreed, "Sure, lets go now."</p> <p>When I got into the apartment, I was shocked. On the back wall was a poster that was just showing all of my body. I could see my breasts and my hips, but you couldn't see even through the fabric of my robe.</p> <p>"Oh my, this is what I look like naked and in a robe," I said, while getting myself ready.</p> <p>"Yup, I could make you feel wonderful for hours," he said, "You might even think that you're beautiful."</p> <p>After we finished lunch, I went to find Mr. and Mrs. Stiles.</p> <p>When I came back, Mr. Stiles was staring at me as I walked into the room. He didn't say anything, and the second I entered the room, he said, "Good morning, Miss Lassie, you look stunning tonight."</p> <p>He came over and kissed me softly and passionately on the lips. He leaned over me and whispered, "I've been wondering how much I couldâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
