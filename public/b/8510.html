The three of them lay back on the small bench, but then, they'd just lie there without a word. It was one of the best memories of his life.</p> <p>After they'd fallen asleep, with only a few light touches of each other, they awakened to find their hosts still there. There, sitting, dressed in silk robes, was Jack, his body glistening with sweat, and his erection pushing against the fabric. "Come to the bed," he said. "You've done a wonderful job. Now it's my turn."</p> <p>"How do I get to the bed, Jack?" the redhead asked.</p> <p>His hand caressed the soft curves of her thighs, running his fingers across the thin, soft fabric covering her sex. She smiled, looking at him. "Just come to the bed."</p> <p>For a long, long time they had watched as he climbed up on the bench, kneeling between her legs as he leaned back on his elbows. She stared at his rock-hard cock, wondering what his magic trick might hold out. He was no ordinary cock, she thought. He was beautiful. The sight of his body before her made her eyes narrow.</p> <p>She reached down, caressing the base of his cock. "Just take me," she purred. "This is your magic," and, after another moment, she slipped her hand underneath.</p> <p>The touch of his hand on her sex sent a shiver through her. She moved aside, and, without giving him time to move, lowered herself on him. His cock speared her and then she sat still, enveloped in the pleasure, while they both stared at each other, his eyes twinkling with mischief as he looked down through her sex to meet hers.</p> <p>"I'm not going to last much longer." He laughed. "Do you want to have it all, baby?"</p> <p>She laughed and nodded. He laughed again.</p> <p>"Just go easy, sweetheart," he said. "We'll give this the old school, won't we?"</p> <p>She nodded.</p> <p>He started with just the tip, and she could feel the heat in his hips start to rise. "No, Jack," she said. "We don't fuck right, we need this." She lifted herself a little and his cock sank into her as if there was nothing more intimate than that. "Don't forget," she told him, and he responded with another push forward.</p> <p>She moved her hips and helped him, urging him to do it, but his eyes showed nothing. She watched as they began to move and the sight made her feel wetter and wetter with each thrust. She felt his teeth graze her inner thigh.</p> <p>"Just enjoy," she told him.</p> <p>He moved a little more, and the look on her face told her that was exactly what he was doing. She felt his other hand sliding up, over her belly, and she closed her eyes, enjoying the attention, hoping he would not stop.</p> <p>"Now fuck me, Jack," she said in a soft, breathy voice. "I want it now – it's all I've been good for – please." To encourage him some more, she lifted herself off him, sitting back on her haunches, her breasts heaving with long, hard nipples. He took his time, holding himself inside her as he rubbed her breasts. She reached between her thighs and stroked his, feeling the hardness of him between her legs; she felt him tremble, and then she felt a wave of electricity course through her.</p> <p>Before he could begin thrusting, she lifted herself up, holding his rigid cock firmly in her hand and guiding it to the entrance of her pussy just beneath her clit.</p> <p>"No, wait!" she told him, and he stopped thrusting so quickly she thought he might come again. He did.</p> <p>"Stop," she whispered. "Keep going with that thing. No more."</p> <p>He continued to stroke, slowly at first and then faster, pushing her against the bench with each one until finally she could take no more. She wrapped her arms around his neck to kiss him as her inner muscles squeezed his cock.</p> <p>"Oh, Jack," she gasped. "Jack," she sighed as she moved off him and onto her feet. She took off her robe and then stepped onto the bench, laying on her back as Jack moved behind her.</p> <p>"Now do it," she directed him. "I want it."</p> <p>In a moment, she'd already stripped and lay on her back. The movement brought him with her, so slowly that she gasped. He came to her and pushed into her in one long, deep stroke.
