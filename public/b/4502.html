I really want to get you out so I can use it to take care of myself."</p> <p>"I'll be happy to give it to you."</p> <p>She gave it a little squeeze and replied with a smile. "Well, it's been a while, but that'll do." She winked and added, "I need to go clean off before I come too close, though. But, I've got to go and see Dr. Stapleton though." She walked out the room and went right to the front door where she stopped and turned back towards me.</p> <p>"I can't wait to see you. I really need to see you."</p> <p>She was clearly nervous, but she had done her best for me, so I let her go. I closed up and made my way to the restroom. When I got there I turned right to Dr. Stapleton.</p> <p>"Hey, Ms. M.?"</p> <p>"Nice to see you again." She smiled brightly and gave me her biggest, sexiest smile that had never left her face. "Thanks for the offer Dr. Stapleton."</p> <p>"No problem, Ms. M." I was instantly thankful that she had decided not to give me a second interview. "How's life in the gym?"</p> <p>"Uhh, I don't think I want to say it, but it's really not that much fun. I get a little nervous sometimes."</p> <p>I felt sorry for her, but I had no intention of bringing anything on this visit. "Well, okay. I guess it's no big deal."</p> <p>"Oh, don't worry my dear. There's no risk of that. And believe me, it's not a big deal."</p> <p>"Well, what did you do, Dr. Stapleton?"</p> <p>"Well, I started out in my room when I had the chance, but then I changed the sheets and changed my bedding just in case. I got really comfortable that Saturday night, and started getting better. I also really wanted to be able to put my foot up when I walked in the door, and I decided to take a nap. I didn't feel like going out, but it was a good time to get rid of your mind. Since I didn't have a good memory at the time, I don't really remember what you did, exactly. But, I figured as long as you didn't forget you can do what you want. If you're up to it, I would be happy to give you a few hours of therapy time."</p> <p>"Thanks, that would be really nice." I was so happy for her so much that my shoulders visibly dropped and my face turned bright red. Her face was so beautiful, I felt like I had just won a million dollars or something. "I'm really glad that you liked it. I've never done anything like that before."</p> <p>She smiled then, and said, "It was really nice." I was so happy and happy to hear that. She actually seemed a little hurt that I had to have it, but overall, it wasn't that bad. After all, the only thing she did the day before was ask me a million questions.</p> <p>We got to the clinic and got a shot of the morning, and headed out to the waiting area. It was definitely different from our usual routine, but no one seemed to mind. After a few rounds of shots Dr. Stapleton got the nerve to just ask me, "Well, how do you feel after your last appointment, Ms. M?"</p> <p>"Well, kind of tired." My mind wandered as I said it, but after thinking about it for a few seconds I realized that, maybe, I just wasn't feeling good after all. Even as I said it I felt like there was nothing I could do to change my situation... not that I had any plans of doing that.</p> <p>"Oh, I was hoping you weren't tired after all."</p> <p>"I'm just having a little bit of fun. I'm not really feeling very optimistic right now."</p> <p>"I don't think you can tell anyone anyway. I've got just enough to keep me busy. You can tell me anything you want. Maybe I'll do something for you."</p> <p>What the heck? I decided to play this in game to see how she would react. "Well, um, yeah."</p> <p>"Just remember that." She smiled sweetly. "You've really done a lot for me tonight. Besides, I feel really good about myself. And I really like what you are doing to me too. I hope you wouldn't do anything you wouldâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
