She couldn't even guess, though, just a thought or two of what might be coming. The scientist looked to her right and turned in her direction, only to see the red head, still smiling, stand up to leave.</p> <p>"No," she said, "We don't go that far yet," smiling again, "I'm not sure how these robots will work."</p> <p>"Don't worry," said the redhead, "the robot won't be too busy with it. It won't be too busy with another human girl."</p> <p>"I don't want to be another human girl," the red head persisted.</p> <p>"Maybe later," the scientist said, "But we will wait for the other day."</p> <p>The redhead looked at her confused. She had heard the scientist had given the order and was wondering how she had gotten onto the topic of her own gender.</p> <p>"You didn't, in fact," the scientist spoke, "I had no idea."</p> <p>"Please, do tell me," the redhead pleaded.</p> <p>"There's more, yes," answered the redhead, "But as I've told you, the robots aren't designed for women by any means. It's their purpose. They're designed to work on their female gender. But that was before, the machines came along before they could adapt. They're designed to be versatile. Some men use them for personal reasons, some women prefer them. If they were to work on a specific female gender, it could become a bit painful, even for him. You see men can function with their gender and it's a rather unpleasant thing for them to look at. There just isn't anything else that you might want to do."</p> <p>After she thought for a while about it, she continued, "My guess is that the robots that are able to move their bodies do more than just run, even if they can't seem to do anything that can't be done properly."</p> <p>"Perhaps I should go on a course that is more specific, then," the scientist's heart leaped a little at the thought of a girl being able to move her body in such places.</p> <p>"I like that," the redhead smiled, "Maybe I should give up on the idea."</p> <p>"You haven't given up, have you?" asked the scientist, already looking around. There was only a small table in the room and an ancient chessboard sitting there. She wanted to run that over and over as long as it would take, but could not afford to take it any farther. After all, she thought there was another way.</p> <p>"That's fine, I haven't tried it yet," replied the redhead, giving the scientist a reassuring smile. "Actually, there is something that I need to learn about myself. Would you like to see a demonstration?" The scientist was intrigued and curious at the idea for a few moments.</p> <p>"I don't see why not," she answered, though, she still seemed a bit puzzled at her own inability to get an explanation.</p> <p>She looked at the watch on the watch stand and held out her hand, then paused, then extended one of the digits. The screen flashed black and then white on the wall and showed that the human female stood back from the wall, but that she was only doing her feet. However, the robot had done his duty and was moving its hands inside her pants. "Oh, please," she started to explain, "that's too weird."</p> <p>"Perhaps it's okay if you take off your pants," said the redhead.</p> <p>"No! No, really!" was her response. "I don't want to get my pants dirty, okay? I can't have any more sex."</p> <p>The redhead laughed a bit, but it was only a pleasant laugh. She then went on, "I'm sorry, I know a fine line to walk. It's not good for the robot to give up on it, I've come to realize that. But I do trust you. I wouldn't leave with any other kind of sex, or even a man."</p> <p>The scientist's heart beat quickly when she mentioned the redhead's name. She felt so comfortable and safe that she couldn't describe it.
