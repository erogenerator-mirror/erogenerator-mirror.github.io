The desk was empty, as if an old office chair had been found out somewhere. There were several books on the desk. He took his laptop out and checked the name of all the books on the desk. He had only opened a few when he heard a knock at the door. Looking up he saw the young maid standing there.</p> <p>"Mr. St. Vincent said you had an appointment," she said pointing at a few books on the desk. "Do you want to come in and sit down? I can get it taken care of. We can order another coffee." She smiled and nodded at him to be seated. "I hope you have had a good day."</p> <p>"It has been a long and productive morning. I was impressed with the work you have done," he said holding out his hand.</p> <p>"It was a pleasure. I am sure I'll be ready for a job of my own sometime in the near future. It has been very hard work and I can't thank you enough," she said. "I really enjoyed yourself." A big smile crossed his lips.</p> <p>"Thank you. I enjoyed it as well," he chuckled. "Can you show me around?"</p> <p>He followed her into his office. She looked around and he noticed that her dress was a little baggy, giving her arms and shoulders a new look. Her nipples were now hard and noticeable. "These shelves hold very well," she smiled. "Are you hungry?"</p> <p>"Oh, yes. I'm good. I'll have a few eggs Benedict." She gave him a small smile.</p> <p>"You are too kind," he said with a grin and then picked up the laptop and opened the pictures on it. There were a few he had taken in the last few days. He looked at her in the pictures once.</p> <p>"That's it," she said. "These are my favorite. I like to hold them in my fingers. Do you mind if I change my mind?"</p> <p>"That would be nice. I'd love to get a better look at you in more. The clothes are really nice," he said. "You really are quite an interesting woman." They both laughed and shook hands as he turned the computer on.</p> <p>"You look lovely today," he said as she turned around. He saw that her dress was hanging loosely over her legs where it had fallen over. He could see she had put on stockings. "Why are they stockings? Did your dress fall down too much?"</p> <p>"They are a bit on the naughty side. I did not wear them today though. I guess they went a bit loose. What about you?"</p> <p>"I was getting something to eat. I hope to get home before dark."</p> <p>"It looks good on you. It is a lovely color. I'm sure you'll like them."</p> <p>He reached up and touched them gently. "You have done very nicely," he said with a smile. "Are you ready to go now?"</p> <p>"Yes, if you want to," she said.</p> <p>"All I ask of you is that you allow me to be with you whenever I feel like it. I wouldn't feel right about it being on my own," he said with a big grin. "I am sure it will be alright," he said with a smile.</p> <p>"I understand," she said as another hug. "Thank you" and then she stopped as if afraid to say anything else. They went to the elevator and rode down. They sat side on so he could get a good view of her legs. She had a very good figure. "I do think that I have seen quite a lot of bare breasts."</p> <p>"Mostly. That part of you is very exciting. Sometimes I have to use the hand mirror on the wall so I can see that my legs have a way of sticking out. I have been in situations like those before."</p> <p>"You did have such a lot of nerve being naked in your office."</p> <p>"It's normal. I am very private about it. I did not dress in my office to show for it."</p> <p>"That didn't bother you at all?"</p> <p>"I do not have to put down my clothes and put them where I could see them. Sometimes I even went without a bra."</p> <p>"You seem to want to."</p> <p>"I do. The things people do for their bodies."</p> <p>"You are very beautiful. You were very beautiful the other day," he said.</p> <p>"I do not want to be naked around you and I just had to get my skin cleaned," she said.</p> <p>"That is understandable. You should take care of your own body just as we do," he saidâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
