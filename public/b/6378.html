You better get your hands off of me! If it bothers you I’ll tell you and I don’t want to share your bed!”</p> <p>I rolled off the bed and tried to put a shirt on to cover my exposed skin. When I did my shirt was at my ass and around my waist.</p> <p>“Oh I’m sorry! Don’t worry about it, okay?”</p> <p>“I’m sure I can find it.” I laughed and went to get more beer. I had been drinking, not very long of a drink, but a lot.</p> <p>“You’re going to be a very tight ass, that is.” He commented as he sat me back on the bed.</p> <p>“Don’t you worry about it. We’re going to have a good time after the show.” I told him as I started to get up.</p> <p>He shook his head.</p> <p>“I like the way you’ve got me. I’ll bet I’ll get the same.” He mused.</p> <p>“Come here.” I told him as I got on the bed. He crawled up between my legs as I laid there. I reached down and grabbed the bottom of his boxers and pulled them down. He’d kicked off those underwear, so the rest of his clothes were in the same line. I pulled his boxers down as well. His erect penis was already sticking out. I looked down at his penis.</p> <p>“No.” I told him.</p> <p>He looked at me.</p> <p>“You don’t get to decide that. This is just the first.”</p> <p>I laughed.</p> <p>“I can just make the next one” I told him.</p> <p>He gave me a sexy look as I put my hand to his penis and started to slowly stroke it up and down.</p> <p>“Are you going to let me,” I asked him.</p> <p>He looked down at me. He smiled.</p> <p>“You should, I guess. It’s really not fair on you, but on me it’s more than fair!” He told me.</p> <p>I shook my head.</p> <p>“I don’t need to be cruel. You look so damn good, don’t you?”</p> <p>He let go of his penis.</p> <p>“Do you still want this? Oh yea, take it!”</p> <p>“I still want, so don’t let me down, baby!”</p> <p>He leaned forward and kissed my on the lips as I continued stroking his hard penis.</p> <p>He slowly lowered his body onto mine. I could feel his manhood touching my lips. He started kissing my lips. We kissed. First he kissed my nose then my mouth. I could feel his dick touch my lips. I reached down and grabbed his balls again. He broke the kiss.</p> <p>“You sure about this?” he asked.</p> <p>“Yeah! Really! Now tell me what you want.” I told him as my hands continued rubbing and stroking his penis.</p> <p>“I want this inside me! Please!” He moaned.</p> <p>“Oh yes, I will!” I heard myself saying before he began to slowly push his penis inside my vagina. Our bodies met again as his dick reached a new home into my vagina. I could feel him all the way up inside me. He slowly started to move his body around, rubbing my penis. I could feel his hardness inside me.</p> <p>I started to stroke his dick a little faster. Now he was going in and out of me quickly and rhythmically. My hand was massaging his penis as he got faster with every stroke. We were both breathing hard, both moaning.</p> <p>He then started to pound my vagina harder. His hands were now on my body. He was hitting the right spot and the other spots just made it feel so good. I could feel his body moving up and down. My hand was also moving the rest of my body. I was doing a little finger-fuck of the same thing. This went on for a long time. I could really feel him moving his hips with his feet. I could also feel his dick hitting my vagina every time his body started to thrust up.</p> <p>He started panting now and was moaning very hard. We were both moaning loudly as loudly as possible. I could feel the orgasm coming up in me too. It was coming on and on with all of us. I could feel my body—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
