"He fucked me!"</p> <p>"No," I said, "he fucked you."</p> <p>"No, I didn't give him oral. I gave him a hand job."</p> <p>"And you gave him oral?"</p> <p>"Yes." Tears began streaming down my cheeks. "You fucked me, you bastard!"</p> <p>"If you would have told me what kind of a slut you were, or what way, I would have told you everything."</p> <p>"It was wrong! We were married! And yet, you couldn't do much about it. How could you tell me? You were so damn beautiful, I couldn't stop staring at you. You looked even sexier when you were on your knees, sucking his cock. Even if he was a real man, he wasn't as big, you know, like Michael. I've never seen a guy as big as him."</p> <p>"No you haven't. What kind of girl doesn't like getting her husband to eat her pussy after he fucks her?"</p> <p>"No, I don't want you to be jealous anymore," I said, "I want to be your fuck buddy, so that you never want to do something."</p> <p>"I wouldn't want to. You'd have me do the same thing, I don't care that I'm married. My husband doesn't even know that I know."</p> <p>"But how would I know that he likes girls, if he never sees me with them? What if he thought I was cheating on you?"</p> <p>"I don't care, what I would rather do is have you with him when he gets to know some other woman."</p> <p>"I doubt it." I felt the room begin to spin faster. If someone had told me the day before about the fact that I had fucked her and another man, I would have said no. The only thing I was positive was that I couldn't think of the last time I had ever been a part of anything that happened. But that was all a long time ago with me. Even though I knew that the next two times would be special for me, it was never a pleasant experience.</p> <p>"I'm sorry," I said as a tear rolled down my cheek. "I should have done something before then, I had no reason to do it. I thought that I wouldn't have any problems if you had had to have your husbands cock inside you just to keep from breaking down."</p> <p>"No, I didn't break it," she said, "it was okay. If you don't mind me saying so, you'll never have to know, okay?"</p> <p>I didn't respond to her, but I did turn to face her. Looking into those beautiful green eyes, I saw the love in them.</p> <p>"Let's have dinner," I said. "We could go to the movies or somewhere."</p> <p>"How about we just go to dinner, and then we can stay out late and fuck," she said. "I'm so horny, I can't see straight."</p> <p>"Okay," I said, and put my hands on her legs. Then I rubbed them softly from back to front. She loved it when I used the "I don't know about being sore" hand. The thing was I loved it when she would ask me to fuck her as hard and as many times as she wanted to.</p> <p>"When are we going to do it?" she asked.</p> <p>"We've known each other for years, and we decided on what to bring. This is what I meant: I want to taste her pussy."</p> <p>"That's disgusting," she laughed. "I don't mind. I want to taste. I want to suck your cock and feel every inch of you inside me."</p> <p>I laughed as she spread her legs and lowered herself on the end of the table, and I moved in between her legs. I kissed her stomach and she pushed her cunt towards me, inviting me to lick it.</p> <p>After a lot of kisses along her thighs, I started kissing up her belly. I kissed the inside of her thighs until she started pushing them open and showing me the sweet pinkness. I was surprised that so was her pussy. There was no pubic hair or anything there. It was a beautiful view.</p> <p>I got on the end of the table and started licking her cunt. By now, her legs were rubbing against my ears. I loved to do that. She had already told me that she didn't find oral and didn't like to have her cunt eaten that way by other guys. Not only did it turn me on, but it also turned her on to know that another man was licking her cunt.</p> <p>I think we both knew we were in for a long afternoon, but neither of us felt like we were about to end that first dayâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
