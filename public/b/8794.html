He had thought about what a great body he had, what he would do to give to it, what would she think of it, what would he make her do for him. He figured he had better go ahead and ask to see the photos. It wasn't that he didn't want to know. And what do you do when it comes to women? It's just his imagination.</p> <p>A little later on, the conversation was getting more and more sexual, and the topic of sex came back to what had happened to him. He sat there in his chair and felt a little dizzy, but couldn't bring himself to respond. He wasn't really sure what to think about the photos. He knew he wanted to ask. But it didn't feel right to him to look at them without asking. And that led to the reason why he was sitting there. In his imagination he thought he could see his wife's ass in the window by the pool in her underwear.</p> <p>He tried to look out the window to look around, but could only see the side of the pool. It was getting late, so he decided to go ahead and ask her, see if she would like to come over and join him. He told her he wanted to see it. She said it sounded great to him. He took off his shirt and sat back down looking up a woman's leg and looking over her panties again. It made him very happy, as he loved to have that effect. Just as he was about to ask her to come look at it she started to run her hand down her panties, looking down at the crotch of them, with a smile. She reached her hand up under her panties and into her top to play with her tit. She pulled the front of her top down, giving him a glimpse of her bra. She was very aroused, but didn't feel like letting him look.</p> <p>He looked back up at the window, again focusing on the fact that no one else was around. He wanted to see them. So he got up and put the blanket over himself, leaving the chair completely empty. He had his feet under the water. He turned to face her sitting on the edge of the pool. He could almost see out her top, but now he didn't want her to see him. He didn't want to just look at her, see those panties. He knew she could see he was looking at her, but he also knew it was mostly for him, to see that she actually did this, it was her first time at the experience.</p> <p>He could hear a woman beside him in the conversation that said it was sexy not to feel, feel sexy looking. He hoped the young woman's voice would make her feel good. "Well, it is kind of sexy just seeing you looking at them. And besides, I feel kinda giddy at the idea of seeing you and a naked woman, especially one that I'm so into right now."</p> <p>"That is good, is it too much for you to be looking at my panties?" he asked. She didn't say much. It's just that if she looked hard enough she could see right down his shirt. She also seemed to feel a little embarrassed. Maybe she's just thinking too fast. They both paused for a moment before she spoke again in a whisper. "Well, we both know. I felt my nipples get hard and I was embarrassed by my nipples, but I felt them getting bigger. I'm so glad you were able to see out my top. Please look, yes. We both know your eyes were looking at me."</p> <p>She was looking pretty damn hot, and he was getting that hard-on, a feeling that he normally felt when seeing her naked. He couldn't hold himself back, he closed his eyes, and just felt his penis begin to tingle.</p> <p>"Oh, wow, that makes you feel better. I love looking at your tits and I'm sure we both would like to see more of your body, too. Now where were we? Oh, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that. I just wanted to make sure not to embarrass you, but it wasn't very good. I don't mean to embarrass you. Please can we keep it a little secret?" He was surprised by the question. He hadn't thought she would want to do that, but it seemed as though they both knew.</p> <p>"Yes, we can keep it a little secret. I don't want to embarrass you. Now, would you like to see more? Do you think you might like to see more of what I'm wearing."</p> <p>"Yes, I'm sure I want to see more," he replied.</p> <p>"I'm still wet down there so I think we might want to see some more tooâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
