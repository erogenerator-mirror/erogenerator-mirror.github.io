They sat down on the bed and had coffee.</p> <p>“What’s up, babe?” Steve asked her.</p> <p>“Nothing much.”</p> <p>“We were so hot the whole night we had sex.”</p> <p>“Yeah, I agree. We fucked like crazy!”</p> <p>“So we’ve had sex all night?” they asked in unison</p> <p>“Yeah, but we all wanted to know when it was over. Now we know why.”</p> <p>“What happened?” they asked in unison, not believing they had just shared a great sex fantasy, a beautiful woman with a gorgeous, young wife.</p> <p>“We have to say we both liked it. We just need to cool off, so this may have been our final night on vacation!”</p> <p>“Oh good. I think I’ll have to call you tomorrow, too. You guys have to come in and we can plan the rest of the day!”</p> <p>“Yeah, I guess we’ll just have to take our chances on getting back to the house.”</p> <p>They kissed their husbands one more time before they dressed, then went to the kitchen to prepare for dinner. Before they left the room they took their shirts off then walked naked down the hall to their bedroom.</p> <p>“Come on in with me, honey!” Steve and Jen asked each other in unison, wanting to play their role so they could hear their sexy voices as they got on the bed.</p> <p>Steve looked around the bedroom, trying the air conditioner in his bedroom, trying to see the time so he could see the TV, but couldn’t. His mind was racing, his body feeling as horny as ever.</p> <p>“You guys got it all right then!” he exclaimed aloud with happiness.</p> <p>Together, they stripped off their shirts and socks while kissing each other passionately, taking off the rest of their clothes and climbing on the bed.</p> <p>They began French kissing while fingering each other’s cunt with their other hand. While they did their thing, Jen’s and Steve’s hands were all over each other, touching, and feeling, caressing and groping.</p> <p>Their mouths were soon joined by Jen’s hands on Steve’s butt, sliding up over his thighs, feeling the muscles there. He was soon kneading Jen’s firm ass cheeks and fingering her cunt. Jen felt Steve’s penis growing against her hand, and opened her legs for him and pulled him inside with a little pressure.</p> <p>He began to pump in and out of her, getting close to his own orgasm. Jen kept rubbing herself off against his cock and getting him closer and closer to orgasm, then let up and reached over his shoulder to kiss him hard and long. Steve couldn’t take much more. He moved his hands to her hips and flipped her onto her back, sliding his cock back inside her cunt, then pulling her down to the hilt so they could kiss.</p> <p>He fucked her long and hard while she rubbed herself on his body. Eventually he felt his balls tighten up and his cock begin to swell up as he approached his own climax. He began to fuck Jen for all he was worth and she seemed to like it.</p> <p>She had a sexy little voice that filled the room with sultry tones, but there was no denying how good it was when she whispered what they were doing to each other. The vibrations on his penis were like sexual electricity, and the feel of Jen’s lips on his as they kissed and fondled each other was a perfect combination.</p> <p>Steve’s orgasm was about to set in. The head of his cock was swelling and getting smaller. It looked like an oversized pencil. Jen could feel the preion of the big head making his cock swell more and more, then it stiffened and finally released the sperm it had been waiting for. It shot a thick, thick film of spunk deep into her pussy with more force than any other male had ever released into her.</p> <p>They lay there, panting, kissing and cuddling each other as they recovered from the most erotic night of them’s lives. The sounds of birdsong, the sounds of dishes and voices drifted down the hallway so they could quietly let each other know that they loved each other as well as they loved each other and had been planning this night for weeks now—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
