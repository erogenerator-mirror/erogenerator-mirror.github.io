My first time."</p> <p>As we reached the front door of her house she looked at me and said in a very demanding voice "No don't let go, come in."</p> <p>"Wait. This is all a huge coincidence because I had all the clothes in a laundry hamper."</p> <p>She grabbed a hold of my arms and turned to walk off.</p> <p>"Look I've been looking forward to you all evening," she said softly, leaning forward to kiss me. "Now let me go and I'll buy you some breakfast. You can shower here and change clothes. It's getting late and you have to get back to work."</p> <p>"Oh no, no my dear it isn't so late."</p> <p>She looked over her shoulder at me a little to give me a look about her outfit.</p> <p>"Here is my card," she said handing it to me. "See you about 7!"</p> <p>With that she turned and walked away from me as she headed towards the front door.</p> <p></p> <p>I went in the house and went to my room. The shower was still running and I pulled out some clothes and changed. My eyes scanned the clothes in the hamper for what seemed like half-a-hour. Finally I decided to pick up those clothes and get dressed. First I put on my slacks and loafers and then slipped into my shirt and loafers. I put on the first shirt and then got my jacket on. A little later I noticed my phone blinking in the mirror.</p> <p>I went back to my room to put on my sweater and put it on. I looked in my closet to find all the clothing I would need for work. When the door opened I saw what I was looking for. It was a beautiful floral print dress that I chose because it was the most comfortable garment on the planet right out of any fashion magazine. It was a beautiful thing with very sheer material, not a stitch of panty on it. After some hesitation I slipped into the dress and fastened the hem at the back. It was a little long but not so short as to interfere with my standing in front of my mirror. I turned sideways and I could see all of my legs in the mirror. The dress showed a lot of my legs and the effect was very sensual.</p> <p>All the same I did not bother with panties because then I saw myself getting out of the dress. I slipped my sandals into my shoes and I walked back to my closet. My heart was racing as I entered the bathroom to put on my underwear. I went out to my bed and sat down with them on my lap. I picked up my cellphone and hit speed dial, going to another number.</p> <p>"Hey honey," I heard her say. The phone was on my left ear now.</p> <p>"Hello," I replied.</p> <p>"Where is it?" she responded.</p> <p>"I'm in town and can't leave town for a couple days. I have a meeting with my business partners on Monday."</p> <p>And with that I got up and got dressed. I had to do something as I had no clue what was expected of me. After all the outfits I had picked out, I decided I just wanted to get dressed as much as possible. So after putting my hair up in a pony tail, I put the dresser top and a dress that I had gotten the night before into a dresser drawer. There was a box of clothes hanging in there.</p> <p>I put on my coat as my mind was wandering a lot. Why couldn't I just forget all of my clothes when it turned out that this was the most sensual weekend I was ever going to encounter together. When I got out of the bathroom, I headed straight for the kitchen and got the box of clothes from the laundry hamper. The day had been a real blast. I had a lot to think about later. I would start the day off just thinking about our upcoming trip. I got the dresser top out and put it into my closet.</p> <p>I went back into the spare bedroom to finish getting dressed. At my study table I grabbed my laptop and plugged it in. Then I went back to her house to get some more work. I sat down the second to last project and spent the next hour doing all of the hard work of making it a solid product. I did everything I could to make this weekend as memorable as possible. I left the rest of the afternoon just so I had enough time to catch up on myself and start planning my life. And my life started getting more and more interesting.</p> <p>"I've got to go," I told myself. "I'll be meeting with some business partners about the weekend."</p> <p>That night I laid in my bed thinking about how much my weekend with Julie brought back to my life. It wasn't like when we were dating or dating friends. I had known Julie for a whileâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
