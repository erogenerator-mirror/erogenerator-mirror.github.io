I asked her if she wanted to hear, and she nodded.</p> <p>"OK, then. It's about something we've been trying to figure out for years. Well, I like you a lot and I thought we might go in the mountains for a while, but I think a trip up here is about the things we have been missing out on for a long time. So I thought... you know, if you guys could do it in the mountains... you'll see, I think," said Laura holding her head in her hands, as she continued. Now here was something that actually made me start to get hot. So, I tried to put it out of my mind so I wouldn't think about it too much, and I told her so... I meant it, I felt comfortable in her presence and I wanted to have a relationship with her... with everything that's happening... "</p> <p>"I know it sounds strange... but I'm OK," said Jenny. I was really surprised that we were still talking about it at all. I mean, if you did something like say something like that to my best friend, it would just blow my mind. "</p> <p>"Yeah, it probably has... so, do you think you'd still want to go back? We could maybe go for a ride in the snow again, or do something we haven't done in a long time," I said with a smile. She nodded, and told her that yes, she would definitely do that, because she felt it would be fun to ride some bears again. "I bet you could have fun with some bears if I could be a little more adventurous. But right now, I just want to be with a man, right?" she said with a smile. I couldn't believe what she was saying to me... It was, so... perceptive.</p> <p>"Well, maybe if we go someplace, we might find a good place to go... I mean, it's not exactly a new idea, is it?" I said getting serious. She nodded. So, that's where I was going, I thought... I told her about my own thoughts at first, because while I had been thinking it would be fun, I didn't imagine what would be in store for me when we did it. She told me how nervous we were about it before we started, and that was probably because she didn't want to have to explain it any other way. I was just grateful that we were not going to have to talk any more - that wasn't important at all.</p> <p>So, here we were, the winter months ahead, and the winter sun was high with clouds in the sky. Well, we'd never gone in high weather before. I figured once we got comfortable, we could get in a decent mood and maybe even have a decent time before we left, as it was becoming rather warm. Maybe we could even sit in her car for a while. But we didn't want to. I guess... I never really had the chance to think about it before. Now, after all these days, I was ready for this. I had even more confidence for the next time. "So when you guys get there, is that OK?" I asked with a knowing smile, knowing that it was for both of us. "Yes, I guess it'll be, 'cause I'll just drive." Jenny looked a little worried, as she was feeling a bit of excitement, to be honest. I could feel the same way, just in my mind. "Hey," I said sweetly. "Look... we're not sure this is a good idea, but as long as you two are cool with it - let's go, I think we're more than OK with it." I said cheerfully and we jumped in the car, the lights flashing in my face.</p> <p>I could feel the heat of her body as we drove down to the hotel in silence. We reached the hotel shortly after 10PM. I saw that the restaurant we were checking out was a short way down the street, and we could see that quite a few people were there. I also had a feeling there wouldn't be much to go on since everyone had already gone out, or that it was just the nightlife of London, as we were in London, and I guess nobody was paying any attention to us. We got back to the hotel, just as the lights went down all the way to the ground - this was a first. She pulled her car on the ramp, and I got in with her. We got our drinks and we headed over to the hotel, just like that, I just knew what was going to happen...</p> <p>The waiter had set us up for dinner, but he was a lot gentler than us, and had obviously been waiting to make sure that everything was ok with the both of us. We went back to the room in our room, I had a feeling weâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
