There's nothing wrong with that," he laughed, his eyes sparkling.</p> <p>I stood and helped him to his feet.</p> <p>"You should try the coffee. I'm so relaxed," I said with a smile.</p> <p>"Great," Brian said, looking out the window. "How about you, Brian?"</p> <p>"I'm good for the rest," he said with a smile.</p> <p>"Well, there's only too much walking," I added. "We can try the walk-in and get your clothes back."</p> <p>"That would be great, sweetheart," he said, hugging me. "Let me get some things and I'll grab something to drink."</p> <p>"Thanks," I smiled back. "I like that shirt."</p> <p>"Oh, it's okay, darling. Come on in and have a drink. You're going to need it later," Brian said with a wink.</p> <p>After we had our drinks a few minutes later, Brian sat back down in his chair and started to type away. This was going well.</p> <p>"You've been out for a while. You need to get back in to your own room," I said.</p> <p>"Yeah, I'm pretty tired," he said with a smile. "You can grab a towel and get a change of clothes."</p> <p>"I'm glad you're still here," I said, sitting down in the next chair.</p> <p>Brian gave me a big hug. This time it was his body against mine for a while, and then he started to kiss me. His lips pressed firmly over mine, and my cock stiffened immediately in his tight shorts. Brian's hands were still at his waist, and he was rubbing his crotch through the thin material of his shorts.</p> <p>"I'm sure you're horny, hon," he said.</p> <p>"You're bad, Brian," I replied with a smile. "I'll show you how bad." After another long kiss, Brian picked up the phone.</p> <p>"Where ever do you want me to? Can I get my clothes in the bathroom?" Brian asked.</p> <p>"Why not go ahead and get them. We'll go take them back," I said.</p> <p>"Okay," Brian said, and handed me the clothes. When I closed the bathroom door, the sound of the shower running filled my ears as I got into the shower. The combination of the sound and the heat had me horny as hell, and I didn't need the air to get me off. In no time at all I was getting really wet, and it was only a matter of time before I had to pull my shirt over my head and dry off. Then I pulled on my shorts and got out of there, heading back to the bathroom when Brian heard me start to make myself busy. When I came out, Brian had finished and was sitting back on the steps of his little apartment. I looked at him.</p> <p>"So, am I going to watch a movie or something, Brian? Do you mind if I watch it with you?" I asked, hoping he would accept the offer first.</p> <p>"Oh, nothing for me. Let's watch the movie and I'll have a beer."</p> <p>"Good. We won't be a minute," I said, getting into the recliner and sliding over to the couch.</p> <p>When Brian got into position, he picked up my remote and started the movie with an old dance on the dance floor. It wasn't an old number, but it was a classic of the type of dances that was popular in the late twenties by the way that Johnny Williams could dance at one point in time. Brian turned the volume up and it was hard to focus on the movie, but the sound of the dance beat in my ears was something that I loved to listen to. After three and a half hours, Brian had a hard-on that needed relieving of whatever pleasure time was left available to him.</p> <p>"Looks like we finished up here," Brian said to me.</p> <p>"You better," I said back. "I don't want to be the only one with an inflated cock to get me all hot."</p> <p>"I'll be happy to help you," Brian said, turning the volume down to low. "It's going to be a while."</p> <p>I got the bottle of Kool-Aid out of the refrigerator and sat down on the sofa with Brian. Brian sat a little closer to me, and put both of his hands over my face.</p> <p>"I'm so horny, sweetheart," he said. "I need some release."</p> <p>Before I could respond in kind, Brian grabbed my hand and pulled me toward him. There was a flash of a moment before our lips touched and our bodies started to melt together. When I didn't resist, Brian's arms wrapped around my body as he slid his lips down to my cheekâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
