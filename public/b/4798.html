I guess it's not a big deal when you're with the two you are with but they'll make you run the rest of the day's events."</p> <p>"You're right dad."</p> <p>"Good, then I'll get started."</p> <p>He was going in a little after three and getting ready to leave. He said he would tell me how to do the arrangements but he had to leave for a client to pick up and we would have time later. He said he was going out of town then and that he would be in town early on Monday morning.</p> <p>My dad had to work on Tuesday morning, so we'd have plenty of time to talk. I went in to the bedroom and got changed before I left. I walked across the hall into the bathroom, opened the door and looked at myself. I liked it and liked the look of myself. I wasn't fat and I was nice looking. I felt a bit of belly to look at. The only one to make me feel better about my appearance than the other men I knew was David. I put on a white tank top and some skinny shorts that showed off a lot of my nice tanning lotion. I also put my hair up in a pony tail. I just left it down my back. My dad had an old Army uniform that was worn a while and the colors were probably from his service in Iraq. My dad always got all the attention and when I first saw my dad dressed that way it seemed like I was wearing a uniform.</p> <p>I found my car and headed off to the local coffee house. I had just come in and sat down when I was startled by a familiar voice.</p> <p>"How are you doing, sweetie?"</p> <p>I turned to see who it was. It was David. My dad had called me and told me David had gotten a job working in his hotel room that he had to go back to before he could go to school to be able to live here again. David's mom had said the day David's mother and her boyfriend moved out she couldn't have him living in the old house. She had always made sure he stayed in a motel room and didn't stay in the same room all morning.</p> <p>"I'm doing great. Just need to do some grocery shopping."</p> <p>"That makes sense. Why don't you have a nightcap and I'll meet you in the morning?"</p> <p>He was a little drunk and I thought he'd fall in the pool for a while. We sat down and I told him I hadn't slept well because I'd been out with a friend so I wasn't too tired any more. He was trying to be lighthearted and not look like he was in some sort of drunken party. We sat and talked for a few minutes and he asked if I'd ever been in an elevator or a public bathroom. He said he'd never been in a hot tub but he would be in it if he were in one and I was in a place to do just that. He said he'd be there. We sat in the elevator for a while and he had just gotten out of the elevator when a very pretty blonde woman got out and started to rub her hands on his shoulders.</p> <p>She asked him to turn around so she could feel his ass and he did while he leaned back slightly and told her she looked great in that outfit. I got out of the elevator and walked over and said hi.</p> <p>"Hi, I'd like to sit if you don't mind."</p> <p>"Not at all hun, I think I made myself comfortable."</p> <p>I walked to the ladies room then and I could get my towel off if I wanted to. I got into the shower and started to wash the wash cloth in there. I started with his chest muscles where I've known he worked since elementary school. I really love my mom and she makes sure I get to her breasts. He has nice pecs and was well built for his age. His upper torso worked well as I worked my way down. My hand got lower and I ran the cloth over him down to his balls. There wasn't anywhere else to go but back up his legs.</p> <p>He spread his legs a bit to make him easier to wash. He really liked going down on me.</p> <p>I knew I wasn't going to wash the rest of him but I got out a cloth to wash up and put the cloth down on the counter. The washcloth I picked up from the counter had two very large soft wash cloths and the third one had two soapy fingers. I slid the wash down the washcloth and started to clean him up. I was getting good at it.</p> <p>I washed over his balls and started to wash his assholeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
