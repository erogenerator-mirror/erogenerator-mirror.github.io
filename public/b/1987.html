He opened the door, giving me more of his warm smile.</p> <p>"It's nothing," I said, as he put his hand over mine as we continued walking towards the lobby.</p> <p>"I was just joking...." his lips teased mine. "And thank you."</p> <p>His hand was warm on my side, my heart was beating so much harder than it ever has in my life. There was very little contact, only us getting in the elevator, and the only one that felt like a safe embrace. Just as we got to the room, I heard the "goodbye" before the door clicked closed behind us.</p> <p>As soon as I opened the door he took me in his arms and kissed me. It was wonderful. I had never been kissed before. It was like my first kiss with another woman. He took his tongue and licked just the tip of it, all the way down my throat and just over my breasts and my erect nipples. I was so surprised when my body shuddered into him. My heart raced.</p> <p>He took me by the hand and practically dragged me back towards the bed, where I fell onto it, still feeling his lips on mine. As he moved his body towards me, he pulled my skirt roughly from my thighs and my breasts hung down slightly, begging for his lips and tongue.</p> <p>His hands were everywhere at the same time. His mouth began to attack them as a hard hot wetness touched my skin.</p> <p>I wanted more. I wanted his mouth on my breasts. I had always craved nipples, they were the most sensitive part of my breasts, and he was making me feel every inch that he could touch. He moved from the left breast, then down my flat stomach, and between my legs, his fingers barely touching me as he moved from the outer lips to the inner lips.</p> <p>I wanted him to lick all of me. I wanted to feel him tongue on me, making me feel like my clit was being rubbed against his mouth with every moment on my body. I wanted everything he wanted. I wanted him inside me, I wanted to feel him explode in me, I wanted to taste him again. We stopped kissing at once, he stood, taking me with him. With my mouth was open, he slipped the tip inside and I felt him hard in me. He pulled my hair back and we stayed like that without moving. His lips moved against my neck, his tongue in my ear. He moved his free hand between us, massaging the inside of my thigh. I felt his hand move, opening my pussy lips so I could feel his fingers entering, stretching my pussy as he was moving inside of me. I moaned his name. I felt his fingers move, opening my lips so they could stroke where there wasn't any space left between my clit and my stomach, feeling my muscles move on them as I cried out over and over again.</p> <p>We stayed like that for long moments, my body trying to arch against his fingers. He stopped moving him, withdrawing his hand and moving towards my breasts, which he began to tease with his mouth, one hand caressing my breasts, feeling the fullness. His hand moved again, this time slipping down my body, parting my legs. His mouth, his hands, the head of his cock pressed against my pussy, I was so wet to him. He pressed against me, I felt the head of his dick slide between my pussy lips and move slowly towards my clit. He was very gentle pushing against my clit as his lips grazed it, his mouth and hands moved at the same intensity as before. I couldn't believe how he would touch me. His fingers moved down my stomach and his lips and tongue explored, I felt my muscles move. I reached up and grabbed his shoulders, holding on as if I was holding on to a cliff, his arms moved over mine, moving them up and down my body. His lips and hands moved back to my breasts - this time I couldn't hold back the moans that were going to escape from me. He pulled back a little, allowing me to arch my back in order to let all of what I needed to be touched.</p> <p>I screamed out once, and this time he couldn't help but move his lips and tongue in a circle around my swollen clit causing me to gasp and cryâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
