"I'm going to cum. Please, don't stop!"</p> <p>"Don't you dare stop, lover," she smiled as her fingers stroked the last little bit of his semen out of his cock. "I want to hear you say it each time."</p> <p>With that, she leaned forward and took the end of his penis into her mouth. She closed her eyes, savoring the taste of his cum as her tongue explored the soft underside of his prick head with its flat, sensitive underside.</p> <p>It was not long before his legs started to stiffen and suddenly his cock began to jerk and throb inside her mouth. After all the teasing and caressing that had happened on the road, it seemed like he was about to cum really hard.</p> <p>"Oh, yessss, dammit!" he growled. "Oh, fuck, yes!" he groaned, then started ejaculating. With her hand still locked on his shaft, she began stroking him in time with his spurts, milking him with her tongue. When it seemed he would come back to Earth, she slowed. He sighed and moaned and suddenly he was back to normal.</p> <p>He was still spurting and she could feel his semen in the way that ran from her pussy and up its crack to her anus. She felt it on her thighs and the head of her penis. That's the only thing that got her off that way.</p> <p>As suddenly as it was done, she rolled him onto his back, his cock still erect, and climbed on top of him. The feeling of her nipples through the fabric of her dress made the whole thing feel different. She felt like she would be cumming herself right then and there.</p> <p>I'm going to take a long time having sex with you, she thought. As she rose up slightly and looked down at his glistening shaft before sinking herself down onto him, she could feel his semen seeping onto her labia and her thighs and her fingers. But she was already feeling so much pleasure and desire, she almost thought she would faint from sheer bliss.</p> <p>"Yes, lover," she said. "I will pleasure you. Right now. But please take your time. Take me slow."</p> <p>"I've come to enjoy this, sweetheart," he said. "I wish I could do this forever. And when it gets to last, I'll do whatever feels good to you."</p> <p>He leaned his head back. "I'm glad we are doing this for your pleasure," he said, and then he was kissing her and caressing her. "Let's get naked so that we do something we're better suited for," he added, rolling himself off of her. "After your long visit, I wouldn't want to rush the process."</p> <p>As she stood, she felt so good that she could barely stand. What is happening to me? Is this some sort of weird dream? she wondered. I know what I'm doing but it's just so wonderful for me. How can it be wrong?</p> <p>As he started getting dressed, she was pleased to see that for once the old lady was gone. The only thing that changed was that the guy that she was with got to the door and opened it, leaving her still in his arms from behind as she leaned on the door. She leaned into him and kissed him again.</p> <p>"If it's such a bad dream, I wouldn't do that for so long," he said. "Your first and only time with me. I'll make sure I spend most of our time enjoying what I'm receiving at the time. I don't want to spoil the experience for you or yourself."</p> <p>"If it isn't like this, I don't care anymore," she smiled. "It's not wrong at all. I like it. And I want to keep doing this for you. If you'd like to be my lover, I'd be more than happy to make it a regular thing.</p> <p>"If it isn't too hard, you can always stop off when I'm ready to go."</p> <p>Before he could answer, she stepped over the railing and began dressing to leaveâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
