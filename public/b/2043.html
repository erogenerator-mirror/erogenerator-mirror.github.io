When they got to the house they were both exhausted, and the next thing they knew, they were in a cab heading around campus to campus. They got to the school's sports field and as he turned off the street, the two of them were both suddenly at a dead run. The two of them were laughing and joking and they found themselves giggling uncontrollably.</p> <p>"You'll have to do what I say!"</p> <p>"I think I'm in love with 'you'."</p> <p>"I want to try for that in your class?"</p> <p>"I think you're the only one for me. It was hard for me to tell from the looks of others who saw the three of us. I think I would have done that on my lunch break, if I knew people were watching us."</p> <p>"Hmmm..."</p> <p>"What do you think about all this, and how we fit in together better?"</p> <p>"That's so sweet of you! I'm still a stranger! I can't believe how you and Momma have always been so close."</p> <p>"Don't act like you don't love them."</p> <p>"I never had to take Momma's words to heart. If I have done anything, I loved her and would do anything to be with her. But you're the only one that I have loved."</p> <p>"I know, and I want to be with her all the time."</p> <p>"Then you've made a new friend!"</p> <p>"You're right! She was so sweet and nice. We have gone through it together and I love having the opportunity to have a sister's time with her. It feels like we are two different people. I wish we had been with one another. I wish my sisters would take me in their strong arms and take me on."</p> <p>"I can't believe that I'm saying this just to get you back together. You really are the only one here that you've got to worry about. I have a plan to get you out of my head as quickly as possible and back into the good life you've been missing since moving in. I hope that you don't feel the same way about me."</p> <p>"Okay, I have no idea if you're the only one."</p> <p>"No, I've definitely got to get you back in the game. We both have to know that you have more than a good life ahead of us."</p> <p>"I do. So, are you going shopping this weekend or leaving campus with Momma this Friday?"</p> <p>"You can help me get ready for your trip."</p> <p>"You would go shopping with me if it meant that you wouldn't have to go home and be with me."</p> <p>"If that's what I wanted to do, you know I would be very happy to help. Why would you think I would not want to take you shopping?"</p> <p>"Because I love you."</p> <p>"Okay, I think I'll do it."</p> <p>"I do love you, honey."</p> <p>They exchanged phone numbers and agreed to meet at a nearby store to pick up some other pieces for Momma's next project.</p> <p>On Friday afternoon, Momma called me and told me about her plans for the weekend. She asked that I go shopping with her on Friday and help her start her research. Momma then gave me a quick and passionate kiss and said, "I love you!" After we hung up, we continued to spend the weekends in each other's arms. Friday evening, I picked her up at her parent's house while she spent the first two nights of the week at home with her husband.</p> <p>"So, what happened with you guys this Friday?"</p> <p>"That was great, Mom. I guess you probably think we didn't get to have some fun with each other, right? I haven't had sex so much in a while."</p> <p>"Well, let the teasing start. I have wanted to show you off to my sisters all this time, so it was a real treat getting all that attention."</p> <p>"I'm surprised you didn't make me do that," she asked.</p> <p>"No, that was my decision. I really want to show you off to my friends this weekend."</p> <p>"Thank you, Momma. You're the best!"</p> <p>"You're welcome. I have so much to teach you, sweetie!"</p> <p>As we drove to Momma's house, Momma told my father all about what had happened to her. When she finished, my father asked her what she had done, if she had been with anyone, before he decided to buy her a gun.</p> <p>"Do you know where she was?"</p> <p>"You and her were in the library, studyingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
