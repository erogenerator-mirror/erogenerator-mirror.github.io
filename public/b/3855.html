We can't," she said, patting her daughter on the knee.</p> <p>"But, we are. You're my little girl," said her father.</p> <p>"But, I'm afraid," she added, patting her daddy's knee a little deeper this time. "I'm your little girl and I want to get out of here so I can relax and be with you, Daddy."</p> <p>Her father nodded and leaned forward as they walked home.</p> <p>"I've got to get to work then. Have fun," he said, taking her into his arms. "See you soon."</p> <p>On the way home, he told her he loved her and gave her a kiss on her cheek. He couldn't believe it, but she was such a good person. He knew she would need to come visit him again, but it was just a chance to talk to her and try and make it easier on her. There was nothing to do now, so they just carried on as if nothing had ever happened.</p> <p>Once again he tried to reassure his daughter. She didn't seem the type of girl who would ever go on some kind of date with no ulterior motive. It was always nice to have someone in your life. Maybe it was time he let her go and get some rest. He knew if mom or dad found out what was going on between his little girl and her father, it would likely make him the victim of a tragedy that might not even occur until he was even more of the same.</p> <p>But he couldn't. There was something so terribly wrong in his relationship with his daughter. Something he tried to hide, but he couldn't. She was so young. She was so beautiful. As they drove home, he could feel his dick hardening as he thought of her.</p> <p>The next afternoon, David drove into the local grocery store and got a bag and some shopping clothes. After the groceries he headed straight to his mother's house. He had to get home before anyone thought he was a pervert.</p> <p>As he was ringing the bell at his mother's front door, he couldn't believe what he saw. His little girl had finally gotten herself into a situation that no man was going to believe she would ever be able to handle herself. What she wasn't ready to admit, or even dare to admit, was that she wanted more than just "normal," there was more of... There was, and was, something else out there that she was not quite ready to confront.</p> <p>He stepped inside the door and saw her sitting up in a chair next to the bed, her face blushing scarlet. The look on her face was priceless.</p> <p>"Oh, fuck! My daughter. You're so young again," he said, trying desperately to calm the growing panic in his son's mind.</p> <p>"I'm sorry," she said, rubbing her hand on her face. "I just woke up, and didn't know where I was. Please, please tell me where I am."</p> <p>"Shit," he said, trying to catch his breath.</p> <p>"Shit," she said again, holding her hands up. When had he become such a jerk? "There, now you know how it felt like to wake up every night. Sorry, I needed to be up early," she said, putting the shopping bag on the small table next to the bed.</p> <p>"It's okay," David said, shaking his head. "It wasn't anything you were supposed to do."</p> <p>"Mommy, no. Please, don't call me that," she said, putting her arms around him and giving him a warm, tight hug. She just held him for at least a minute before she pulled away. "How long until you're ready to get out of here?"</p> <p>"I'm not ready to get out of here."</p> <p>"What happened? Are you sure about getting out. I'm sure we can be together again, if we want to. We're here, aren't we?"</p> <p>"This is your decision, Mom."</p> <p>"Then I guess we should go get something to eat," she said.</p> <p>David was almost relieved to hear her say that, before he knew it, they were on their way out. Once they were out of the store he tried to calm down, but he just couldn't. He was too frightened to do anything other than lie there in her arms holding him in her arms.</p> <p>David walked back to his house, with a few of his clothes on. He felt so helpless, lying there with his mother just holding him in her arms. He had never, ever, felt so...so vulnerable in his life. It just made him feel even more helpless.</p> <p>When he got home for lunch, he went straight to his room. He stripped down to the most boring pair of boxâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
