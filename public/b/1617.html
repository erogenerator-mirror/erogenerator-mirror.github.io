I don't want to interrupt the fun that we're having."</p> <p>"Oh well, then lets go and have our good time. I can't wait to hang out with you this weekend!"</p> <p>"Thanks, Honey. I'll take my time getting ready." We kissed briefly, and then she got to go to the bathroom.</p> <p>After about five minutes I had a wicked idea. "Hey, baby? Do you need a quick shower while I'm at the bathroom?"</p> <p>"No. I just need to be sure everything's OK!"</p> <p>I put in a clean pair of boxers and a tee shirt. As I finished pulling one on I heard, "Hey Baby, you still up?"</p> <p>"Yeah, got to run. I'm going to go get some sleep. Make sure everything's OK." She was standing naked in our bathroom, with my arms around her, her head buried in my shoulder. As I looked at her I could clearly see her pink nipples pointing straight towards me, and her lips were covered with a slightly darker shade of pink across the whole, but the rest of her lips were slightly parted and slightly parted. I slipped my arms around her and hugged her tight, feeling her nipples pressing up against my chest.</p> <p>"You feel soo good," I said into her ear.</p> <p>"I'm glad you made an effort and took your time deciding if you want to take me back to our hotel." I lifted her and carried her into the bedroom. She sat down on the bed, turned on the sheets, and spread her legs.</p> <p>"Go get a glass of wine, and bring it back here, and I'll get you a glass, too." I went into the kitchen, put on the wine in the fridge, and came back with an old fashioned bottle opener. "Go get us both a glass, too, and bring back the opener." I got her a glass and set the bottle and it on the table. She brought us our wine, and we sat in the sofa, my arm wrapped around her, and her head resting in the crook of my arm.</p> <p>"Good night, baby," I whispered to her, and she leaned over and kissed me on the mouth.</p> <p>"Good night, too, Honey. I'll see you in the morning." I was feeling very comfortable with her in my arms, and I couldn't imagine my life without her.</p> <p>I walked her to the door, turned it softly and walked her to the passenger side of the car, then opened the door for her. "Come on, let's get you in the seat and we shall, shall be back on the road!"</p> <p>As I took her out into the parking lot, I was amazed at how pretty she felt, and I thought, "This is the way to life, isn't it? This is the way life should be, isn't it?" I had a good feeling about the future.</p> <p>We got in the car and I started the truck. She reached over and put her finger into my mouth, and said, "I can't wait to see what happens after we get going."</p> <p>"And you can't wait to see me, as well. If anything happens, we'll have to leave right away, or you can just drive us home if you want."</p> <p>"I think I can do both. I'm feeling pretty nervous about tonight, and I'm afraid our night of fun just got away from us." We were quiet for a moment. "I feel a little bad about leaving you hanging like that, Baby. I'm not sure how long I'm going to be able to hold off from making you cum on my tongue before we get home."</p> <p>"No, Baby, everything is fine. Maybe some of my anxiety just is you seeing me differently. I'm not sure if I'm ready to be with you again."</p> <p>"Well, there is that little part of me that you're afraid of," she said with a chuckle, and kissed me with more passion. I felt myself getting incredibly turned on.</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"My pussy is soaking just thinking about going back to the hotel, in between that long plane ride home."</p> <p>"Oh! That is so hot! It's like a wet dream come true."</p> <p>"No, it's not," she said, "I was scared to tell you, but I'm happy you're enjoying it. I'm happy you're making me feel special."</p> <p>"I'm not feeling like you're doing me, Baby, I'm doing you!" My hands found one of her hands and pulled it gently to my face. I leaned towards her, our lips touching softly, our tongues exploring each other. I took her face in my hands and kissed her lightly, and then I pulled back andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
