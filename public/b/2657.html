She was in her pajamas and her hair was down. “How do you doin?” She asked.</p> <p>“Just good,” he said with a big grin. He reached out and grabbed a blanket for her, covering her as the smoke cleared and stopped.</p> <p>“You sure know how to use that thing,” she whispered. “You know, I wish you could put it into my pussy, but right now, at least, it’s just you.” She took another hit, starting to smoke.</p> <p>“I know,” he said seriously. “I want to lick you all over, but the fire is a nice, soft spot.” He wrapped his arms around her to hold her tight. She felt his fingers run over her face.</p> <p>“I’m sorry,” she said, looking at him. “I forgot. Don’t think I’m a slut. I just didn’t know you were there until now.” She let his arms hold her down as he felt the warmth of her cheek.</p> <p>“I’m sorry, little dove. That’s your problem.” He tried to calm her down, so he could get dressed and get out of here. “I’ll call you later, I have a surprise for you.” He left her standing in front of the fire for awhile. He ran to the back of her yard and grabbed a few things to cover the flames as she started to get up. “Hurry,” he called to her. He took off running to the end of the yard towards the cabin. He was about to grab the rope when his mom grabbed him.</p> <p>“Hold it!” She pulled him forward. She turned and ran into the cabin.</p> <p>“What is wrong?” he asked.</p> <p>“Nothing. Go on in,” she smiled.</p> <p>“I can’t believe I had no idea where she could be.” He walked into the middle of the cabin. He stopped short when he saw her. A woman, maybe 30 must have been standing by the fire. She held his hand for a moment and turned to face him.</p> <p>“What?”</p> <p>“I’m sorry. It was me. I was wondering why she was standing there while my boy was gone that morning.” He smiled. “Do you have someplace to go?” She looked at him as if he was insane. “Can we call for help?”</p> <p>“No, I’m fine. Let’s get some stuff from there,” she replied.</p> <p>He pulled back and turned towards the house. He grabbed his cell phone where he left it. He dialed the number off. When the answer was answered, she sat quietly.</p> <p>“Hello?” She asked as she answered.</p> <p>“Kev?” the number said.</p> <p>“Hi. I’m going to be late. Did something happen?” he started to speak again.</p> <p>“You’re late.” She answered honestly. “I think you should get to your room before I run out.” She heard him chuckle. She smiled.</p> <p>“Okay,” he started. He walked into the house and grabbed his things to get them out of the trunk. About half way to the door, he heard her say something else.</p> <p>“Wait!” He heard her shout. He opened it quickly. Her skirt was hiked up around her waist as she turned back to him with a smile on her lips.</p> <p>“Did you…?” she asked. He stood up and walked towards her. He felt his pulse racing as he placed his hands on her hips.</p> <p>“Did what happened?” He ran his lips across her neck. “Did you find anything on that box?” He felt her shudder. “No,” she breathed. “I was just thinking out loud, I hope you don’t mind—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
