He had given them the keys when he said they were to leave his property, even though they had to be eighteen or older. He had told them that he couldn't just leave the property. He didn't want to leave a young, cute boy at school at home and there was only so much the school could endure. He was sure the school would be upset if he even made a suggestion and had even sent out a complaint to the principal.</p> <p>The three kids got to the school the fastest. The two older girls walked into the school from the bus as far away from the parents as they could. The younger kids did a double take and realized that they had to stand in front of the teacher.</p> <p>"Um," Jared muttered, thinking that the two girls would be easier to spot if all of them were standing on the street. His father hadn't been home the whole time. Jared would have walked up to the teacher if he had just got there. He took a risk and said, "Mrs. Martin, I want to thank you very much for letting me have lunch with you."</p> <p>Mrs. Martin smiled at him, "Oh thank you," she said. Even from a distance she couldn't remember when they had seen her. "It would also be rude of me to not let you be alone with Jared without a warning that he is going to start yelling or something. The kids, your dad has called and told me that his boys have been in trouble over last night so he has sent out a warning. I can't do anything with my children that is going to lead to them getting thrown out of school. Jared would hate that." She finished her sentence out loud with a small quiver that seemed to be amplified just in the wrong way, making the words seem like a challenge. Jared saw that Mrs. Martin was in her late twenties. She looked just as attractive as she had the night before. She had a pretty face and her hair was a color of her grandmother's and he knew that the color was inherited.</p> <p>Mrs. Martin was dressed in her most elegant dress, an expensive but stylish black cocktail dress that had a slit that went halfway up her thigh. The dress showed a sexy expanse of her thigh where the material flowed over it and when she turned, he knew that if she bent over to bend over, her breasts would be on display.</p> <p>Mrs. Martin took them both at their word. The two eighteen year olds ran up to her as they tried to stop their parents from going out. She kissed Jared on both cheeks and then held out her arms for him to come over to her as they hugged.</p> <p>"Hi, my name is Mrs. Martin," she cooed.</p> <p>They took up residence on the bench so the older kids had a better view of them. Mrs. Martin pulled him up and they sat down to their lunch.</p> <p>Jared's mom sat down on his other side, her skirt riding up as she sat and he could see right up her skirt. "So, Jared," his mom said. "We wondered if you would like to try out one of these special day courses. Your mom has recommended several classes that I think are very special to your grade."</p> <p>"Mom!" Jared's mom yelled. He was shocked at her. Jared had seen Mrs. Martin dressed up in a suit and a skirt from now on in her classroom, but now his mom was going with him. "You can't go out wearing this school dress without my permission."</p> <p>Mrs. Martin glared at her son. Mrs. Martin's skirt flew up again and her breasts were bared like the rest of her.</p> <p>Jared's mom was a sweet old lady. She had given him a good grade, but he had only been trying to help Jared. He was glad that he had asked her to go with him, to see how good he could see her. He wouldn't change that anytime soon. He had just found out that his dad had told his mom that Mrs. Martin couldn't go without her approval, but that Mrs. Martin never wore her school dress at home. Jared would have loved to have had a look at those big round tits. When he was a teenager he couldn't help wishing that they were more than a handful. He hoped that there was more to his mom than just a handful to hold or her big heavy breasts.</p> <p>"Jared is very cute," Mrs. Martin said as a matter of fact. "Mrs. Martin is very lucky that she was able to stay in shape." Jared shook his head at his mom. She was still pretty in a girl-next-door sort of way. They had always been just as different as two little boys. Her breasts were smaller, but not as heavy as Mrs. Martin's. She had always been a little too thin.
