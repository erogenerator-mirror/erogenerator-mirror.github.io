He had never experienced such a level of intimacy with any of the other girls, not even Lucy, so he simply grabbed her ass and made the most of his new found ability to pleasure her. He would try to remember it later this evening when she had her first orgasm.</p> <p>She broke the kiss and kissed her way down his neck as he continued to kiss her. Her lips touched his as he moved down her body and it felt like someone had poured more passion into kiss after kiss on top of her head.</p> <p>His kiss had longed there and it had never stopped. He could not believe how much he loved it. He was glad that he had been so bold and this whole seduction session had been such an exercise in seducing his new sister. He let himself enjoy the moment, savoring every second, and knew that soon it would be time to explore her body as he wanted her to experience this incredible sensation of being penetrated.</p> <p>She gasped when he took her nipple between his teeth and then slowly took the other into his mouth, sucking it as he did so. She had never had sex before, but in the meantime it was like nothing else she had ever had. Her breath quickened and she felt her orgasm building. She reached between them and took him in her hand.</p> <p>He knew what she wanted and in no time he had moved between her legs, and in a second his cock had joined her in her orgasm. He had never felt anything like it. It was so electric and he could still taste the sweetness of her pussy on his tongue, but it was far more intense than anything he had ever known. He did not even realize until he felt her body shivering under his efforts.</p> <p>She collapsed onto the back of the couch and took a deep breath. She had not yet cum, but it had been a real orgasm and she had to know how badly she wanted to feel his cock inside of her. He had moved over towards her face and she immediately leaned down to take his cock into her mouth. She tasted the mix of her juices and his cum and it was a wonderful combination. She was lost in this moment, and the moment she would remember later when she had the time and inclination to do a lot more than just lick his cock. She sucked at him greedily as she continued to pleasure herself with his member.</p> <p>"I think I'm going to cum now." He panted. She felt his hand gently caressing her hair and neck and then his fingers moved to her tits and began to pull and massage them.</p> <p>'I want this to last, please let me cum!' she thought wildly. 'I want to feel everything you have to offer.' She felt her juices flowing even faster. He just continued to knead her tits and tweak her nipples.</p> <p>"Oh God...Oh God, you're going to make me cum!" She was going from one intense orgasm to the next. "I want you...do me...do me!" She had never been used by such a wonderful man before. Her own orgasm approached and she felt him start to push her head to one side, but she stopped him. "Not yet." She told him. "My legs need a rest and I want to feel you inside."</p> <p>Her words only intensified his excitement. He did not care because right then she had found a place that she had only dreamed about for so long. She reached between her legs and grabbed his cock and pulled it towards her and then in one motion began to guide it into her waiting sex. She took it in to the hilt and stopped at the depth of her penetration and then let him stay in there until she could tell him he would not withdraw.</p> <p>She had wanted him to, for him to get his cock as far in her as possible. It had felt huge. But he did nothing but give her a big hug and a soft kiss and then slowly begin to move in and out with long, deep strokes. She was getting wetter and wetter and she could feel every ridge and vein on him. He was as tall as she was and he was thrusting hard into her very wanting position. He was making love to the woman he intended to marry.</p> <p>He knew he would not be able to cum this way, even if it was necessary and he had to wait until the very end. He did not think it would be long before he came when she was about to climax. The way she was holding him, that slow and steady rhythm that she knew so well, was amazing and she felt the building pressure in her groin even stronger than before. When she felt herself getting there she began to move again.</p> <p>She felt the urgency build deep inside and when she explodedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
