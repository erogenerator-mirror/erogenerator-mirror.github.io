I ask him and we both smile. "It's been hard for me to be away."</p> <p>"No." He looks at me. "I have a feeling that I am staying just because there are girls who want me." There is something in his eyes that I cannot explain. That's why I'm surprised to be telling him.</p> <p>"What do you mean?" I ask him as I sit up slowly. He does too. I reach out for him but he just moves back, his eyes down to the bulge in my pants which I was about to tear into when I heard him gasp.</p> <p>"Just watch me." I say to him and start to stroke myself thinking maybe we could have a few moments and get some release. He watches for a moment, his hand moving up and down on his cock and gets up and sits beside me on the couch. When he does so I turn my body around so that my mouth is inches from his and I can feel the pressure in me building. I grab his hand and place it between my legs. He touches me there then slides it in to my warmth. We were both so wet that it didn't take much. We both began moaning for each other. I leaned my head over to his cock and he began kissing me the way his cock is kissing me. I didn't think I could do this but for the first time in my life he made me do it. His tongue began to lick me like it was a lollipop.</p> <p>"I am going to fuck you." he says as he leans forward to kiss me.</p> <p>"Please." I am almost incoherent when my body is on fire for him. His tongue is inside me and moving it around. I know that it will be good. I cannot wait.</p> <p>"I never told you that you could cum with me." He says as he moves his hand to my pussy. "Your pussy can do more than just a girl can."</p> <p>"I am good." I tell him as he brings his finger to the hole. He touches it and looks at how wet all my juices are. He moves his fingers in and out of me then inserts another. I can feel it pushing against my walls and my whole body is on fire. I feel so relaxed and wanted this whole night. I think that I could have had this for years. He continues pumping between my legs while my body is on fire for him.</p> <p>When he touches my clit, I feel myself start to come. I open my eyes and look at the ceiling then back up to the faces of the two men beside us.</p> <p>"Oh!"</p> <p>"Cum for us." One of them says. I look between their eyes as his fingers penetrate me but doesn't move. "Cum now." The two men say together. I feel like I am on a roller coaster or something being lifted. Just as a car stops I am there. I feel as though I am flying out of control.</p> <p>When my body stops it releases all of its tension on me. My legs are weak and my breathing is so heavy they both begin to laugh. I can hear my heartbeat too. They say that I am so lucky to have someone willing to share me with them. All the men begin to stand up to go to the women.</p> <p>"I want to show you what a woman should do when she is with a man."</p> <p>I stand up and look at the men and they look back at me and smile. I smile back and look at my body to see if they are still ready to go. But they are, but only for a moment. The women pull me back by my arm. I notice that my body is dripping with excitement. They walk me hand in hand and begin walking me to the back.</p> <p>"No one is going to go with us and put all of these clothes on." I see a grin on their faces.</p> <p>"Let me get the clothes, I have an idea." I say and reach out for the men. "But if we take them off you can still get a better look at my pussy." I say with a giggle to them. They are laughing again when I put on the white silk dress.</p> <p>"It's like this."</p> <p>"Let us help you find the room."</p> <p>I smile and ask them to open the door and pull the curtains. I look at the men then at them until they are on me. Then I feel something hard as though they are standing beside me. They take off the rest of my clothes then I feel the hardness on my skin. I can only imagine how it feels for both of them.</p> <p>I feel them take each one of my arms and lift me up by them to where the bed is. I feel that it will be aâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
