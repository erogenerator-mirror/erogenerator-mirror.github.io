Well, at least the next guy has your attention, or at least a little."</p> <p>"You're right. I was just being friendly, that's all."</p> <p>He held out his hand for Julie to shake; she shook his hand awkwardly. "I'm Pete. Julie, nice to meet you."</p> <p>She held out her hand then gave him a smile, "Pete. That's Julie from next door, we used to go to school together." She held out her other hand.</p> <p>"Yeah, I knew him from our past, and well, guess how we never got around to getting around to dating, though he's still around."</p> <p>Julie said, "We can get dressed again. It's going to be a nice evening, and I've been looking forward to it. I'm having dinner tonight."</p> <p>He said, "Well, I guess we can take care of our food then, maybe get a decent movie for later tonight, or maybe we should call it a night." He chuckled, "This is going to be a pretty good dinner, I know a whole lot of places we can go."</p> <p>She smiled and nodded, "That would be nice."</p> <p>They finished their drinks, and he asked if she would like to come to his house for the night. She took a sip and said, "Let's go have a nice night out, you know how they make it out in the desert."</p> <p>He took her hand and kissed it softly, "Come tonight, Julie."</p> <p>She stood up and he took her hand and they walked arm in arm to the entrance of his house; he opened the door for her and then said, "That was quite an evening."</p> <p>"It sure was, Pete."</p> <p>"The fun doesn't stop at my kitchen, right? When I get back here, I'm going back in with you to do some sight-seeing." He pulled her into his arms again, and kissed her softly on the lips, "You've got a lovely home; I love living in it."</p> <p>She squeezed him tight against her, and kissed him again, "Oh, Pete."</p> <p>"Julie. I love your home."</p> <p>"You do too, Pete. I really do."</p> <p>He hugged her, he could feel her breathing was quick, and she was looking him over, her hands sliding down his bare chest and her fingers brushing his hairy chest.</p> <p>"We're going to need to do this again, sometime," he said, holding out his hand for her, "Come on then, Julie, let's go take a short walk, then we'll head back to my place and catch a movie."</p> <p>They kissed lightly again as he led her to his car, taking her hand again, and they kissed again at the car window.</p> <p>"It's not too far now, is it?"</p> <p>"Of course it's not," he replied.</p> <p>They walked across the lawn to the main road just a little ways. There were a variety of houses along the way, each one had a different style of house. In one of the houses, there was the classic 'V' shape which emphasized the importance of tall hedges around the house. It also served the purpose of keeping things somewhat private, so they wouldn't bother anyone, not the neighbors that lived in the house.</p> <p>They reached Peters' house, and they kissed again, then both stepped inside, kissed again, and he held out his hand for her to take it. She accepted, and walked to her house.</p> <p>As they walked to his living room, he looked at her, and raised an eyebrow. She turned her head and smiled, holding out her hand for him to kiss. His eyes were already gluing to the profile of her body, and he grinned when he saw her eyes glancing at his groin.</p> <p>He stepped towards her, kissed her cheek, then held out his hand to her as he moved back. They kissed again, and his arms went around her waist. He cupped her ass, and she gave an appreciative sigh. He lifted her and kissed her gently on her lips.</p> <p>She returned his kiss, and he held her against his chest while they kissed. Their tongues probed their mouths as they enjoyed the kiss; his hands roamed over her body, fondling her breasts while his tongue caressed hers. They broke from the kiss long enough to take off their sweaters and he pulled each of her arms around his neck. She loved it when he did that, knowing that this man in the arms of a sexy stranger, not a stranger, had no idea who she was, but she didn't care, all of her worries about being watched went out the window.</p> <p>He ran his fingers through her short hair, and he pulled her toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
