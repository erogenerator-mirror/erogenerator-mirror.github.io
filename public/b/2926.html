Here's the best present ever on you."</p> <p>When she brought back to face me I was completely blown away. She reached up and grabbed my hair making it stuck up in tangles. "I'm gonna give you the best fucking you ever had. You've been a very bad boy. This is what happens when you're not properly motivated. When you're ready to give this woman the ultimate pleasure, you're gonna give her what she wants." She took my face to her and planted a huge kiss on my lips. "It seems that you love to eat pussy." My cheeks flushed as my heart raced.</p> <p>"I don't know if I could do it right. We're both married and...."</p> <p>"I'm not the one on the couch and you're a stripper, not a little stripper at all. No, I like to lick her pussy every second of the day before you."</p> <p>"But..."</p> <p>"Oh, sweetie, it's not that. It's not just for me. The best part of it is when she comes, you get that special treat." Her tongue was back to work, licking with increasing intensity. After a few minutes of this I realized that a little orgasm was in order. "Let's go to her bedroom and I'll teach you how." She was now kissing my lips, her hand sliding through my hair and down to my stomach. Her fingers slid slowly down, caressing across my stomach toward my pussy as she slipped a finger in with all her might. Instantly I squirmed.</p> <p>"Relax, let this one go. Just enjoy the sensation. You'll get there when you're ready. Now, I'm going to stand up and we'll have sex."</p> <p>Even as she spoke, the sex had been good. Her fingers teased the opening to my pussy, sliding deeply inside me as she stroked my G-spot. Her tongue licked from bottom to top, making every stroke slick. When she reached the top she lapped at my clit slowly, letting my body react. When I thought I couldn't take any more, she pulled away from the pleasure. "How about some foreplay. I'm all yours." Her voice was a gentle caress, her voice dripping with heat.</p> <p>Once again I was on the couch. My arms and legs were now in a tight ball. I was watching the action on the screen, and my heart was beating so fast I feared I might explode any second. She was kneeling on the floor, her heels barely touching my thighs. Her shoulders were against the wood of the couch, knees and elbows pointing toward me. Her hands were spreading her own pussy lips to expose the inner pink flesh, making her lips glisten in the moonlight. In the middle of her, she moved her hands to her pussy, rubbing and pulling on it, spreading wetness and pleasure along her gash. I was mesmerized. I kept my mouth shut. It took all I had to keep from staring. The fact that her eyes showed the same excitement as mine did was a turn on.</p> <p>"Watch the video," she said.</p> <p>We watched the girl on screen begin to pleasure herself. After a little over two minutes of teasing, she began to come. I heard the squishy sounds of her flowing juices and thought she was actually trying to pull my juices into her mouth. She swallowed, allowing a small trail of fluid to escape, making a drop drop sound. She kept sucking for awhile as she calmed down, then pulled away. It took several moments for me to regain control of myself. With her eyes on the screen she turned her back to me and spread her cheeks apart. She pointed toward the TV. "Come on, you little slut," she commanded.</p> <p>I obeyed. I climbed on the couch so that my head was next to her neck, my body leaning backward as I leaned forward. She reached out with her hands, grabbing my head, pulling my mouth to her shoulder. Our lips met, softly yet quickly. She had an incredible tongue, soft and gentle. Our tongues danced as I explored her neck. My hands rested on her cheeks, pulling them toward me. I could feel her chest, rising and falling with her breaths. She pulled me closer. I could practically feel the warmth of her pussy on my stomach. "Now, let's see you." She pushed my head down toward her, pressing my face into her shoulder. "Masturbate for me," she commanded.</p> <p>I was so shocked by the first touch I had not been aware of myself until I felt a tongue licking and flicking across I pussy, her hand playing with my breast, her fingers on my breasts. I was close to heaven and could not wait any longer. I was shaking. She pulled me to her and let me kiss her lips. The soft kiss I had always received from her wasâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
