The same morning sunlight had flashed through the window, then I felt my arms being drawn above my head and my legs tied to the crossbeam, by the wrists. My thighs had been spread, my legs and ankles were tied to the leg rests tightly as far as they could go, then my ass was held apart by the rope above and I could, only, feel what the rope was for. I'd already been fucked twice this morning, and it was the first time in such a way ever.</p> <p>I heard a groan coming from somewhere in the cabin, and I realized it was coming from her. She must have been sound asleep.</p> <p>But I didn't know where I was or what she was seeing. My first thought was that she was waking me. But I didn't really hear her anymore. In fact, her moans seemed to have got a little louder, as well as more guttural. I think I could have probably heard her breathing or something else, but I wasn't really in the cabin.</p> <p>I felt my nipples being pulled up and then something cold and hard being applied to my right nipple, which still had not gone numb because of the shock. I could also hear someone getting out of a back door. The sound, while definitely distinct, was muffled, not unpleasant, not at all. When the hands came back and held my left one, I felt a sharp bite on the other one, and I gasped in both pain and pleasure.</p> <p>She released my head and I realized she was holding something on my left nipple. I could tell what it was, but I couldn't tell what it was. She pulled my right nipple hard, like pulling teeth. I felt a pair of lips kissing my collar bone and then a hand moving on it. The hands moved to my stomach and then down and grabbed my thighs hard and lifted them back on my thighs and started spreading them. My knees were forced back and then I realized I was spread wide!</p> <p>Then I felt something cold, hard, and a lot bigger than the object on my tit. Then again, and again I felt something cold, hard, and the pressure on my pussy began moving in a lot of different directions. I could feel the tip of what felt like a long, slender object, like a knife, slowly move up and down my slit, rubbing the top of the object against my clit, then my clit and a few more inches in, until I could feel that it was pressing against my inner lips. My hips moved to meet it. "NO!" I thought, "That will not go in!" This was just torture, but it was arousing beyond words.</p> <p>The pressure continued moving up and down my pussy and against my clit until I felt the head of the object press against my vagina. It was small and thin but I felt the pressure against my soft inner lips and then slide in a little. I tried to spread myself wider, but the pressure on my inner lips kept me still. "No, no, no! Don't do that!" I pleaded, but couldn't see a thing.</p> <p>The pressure in my pussy suddenly stopped, and I felt the hard object slide in a little farther, stretching me open. I started begging again, even though this was no game.</p> <p>"Stop! Oh, please stop, please!" And when I felt the tip of the object, it was as slender as my first one, slide in, the pressure stopped and then it went back out and the pressure on my opening went back in a little further. I was sobbing by then and then I felt the very tip of the object move out from between my inner lips, and slide back into its position inside my pussy. I could feel the hard object slide inside me.</p> <p>I thought I was going to cum, yet the pressure insideâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
