I see," I teased. "Let's go back to my room."</p> <p>As I walked with me, both of my hips continued to sway. I felt my skirt ride up and expose more of my hip.</p> <p>"Wait," I whispered. "It feels like my skirt is going up a little bit."</p> <p>I pulled my skirt back down. "You'll have to go a bit further," I joked.</p> <p>"What?" he said suspiciously. That seemed kind of unusual.</p> <p>I took a few steps forward and began to unbutton his shirt.</p> <p>"What are you doing?" he asked.</p> <p>"I'm going to unbutton your shirt," I said. "Do you like what happens when someone unbuttons their shirt?" I asked as I slid his shirt off his shoulders.</p> <p>He laughed as he reached around me to unsnap my bra. "Mhmmm."</p> <p>I moved back into his arms and unclasped his shirt. We made our way back towards the sofa. His hands rubbed up and down my arms, along the straps of my bra. I ran my fingernails through his hair. He put his arms around me and my hands found his body.</p> <p>Once our bra unhooked, he placed his hands on my shoulders, slowly moving them down my arms. I moved my hands under the straps. He undid them and brought them up. I stepped out of my skirt before he removed it. His left hand cupped my right breast.</p> <p>"No bra, huh," he teased. He cupped it, sliding his hand along the length of it, before bringing it back to my nipple. I could feel him pinching it. I closed my eyes and enjoyed it.</p> <p>His tongue ran up the inside of my neck. I ran my fingers through both our hair.</p> <p>"Mhmm." He started kissing his way down my neck. He ran his lips over my collar bone, then the underside of my breasts. He took my nipple between his teeth.</p> <p>"Oh, yeah, yeah," I moaned. He kissed down over my stomach and down the outside of my right leg.</p> <p>He pulled my thigh toward his, then stopped. "Not yet," he said. "You still not allowed."</p> <p>"That's okay," I answered. "I'm getting excited."</p> <p>"You're sure," he responded. He reached around and unclasped my thong. He pulled it off and tossed it on the bed behind me. I stepped out of my skirt and took my shoes and socks off. I put them back on.</p> <p>"Wait," I asked as his hands moved to my stomach.</p> <p>"What are you waiting for?" he asked. He lowered me onto the bed. His right hand continued its movements down my stomach to the top of my mound. I could feel the top of his finger pressing inside my pussy.</p> <p>"No," I said. "Not yet."</p> <p>He moved up to the top of my bush and began to gently run his finger around it. I felt it enter me and I almost came, but didn't. He pulled his finger out and replaced it with his tongue. His tongue ran around my clit. His left hand continued the massage until I could feel the head of his dick press against my body.</p> <p>"Come here," I said. He pushed me down to the side of the bed. I rolled onto my back. My legs were still on the bed. I beckoned for him to join me. He moved toward me and I moved up to put my head on the pillow.</p> <p>He crawled between my legs. I felt the head of his dick press against me. I reached down and slid it in.</p> <p>"Ohmygod," I said. His dick felt bigger than the first time. It was longer. It made my pussy tingle.</p> <p>His hand found my breast and he gently began to play with the nipple. I brought my hands down to the side of my chest and slowly caressed it against my body. I placed my hand on his chest and gently pushed against him. Then I pulled him on top of me. He slipped his dick inside me.</p> <p>"Ohhhh," I cooed.</p> <p>He gently fucked me with his dick every few strokes. He kept teasing me with the tip of his dick while his mouth pleasured my body with his lips and tongue. His fingers teased my clit.</p> <p>I raised my hips with each stroke on his dick. He began to drive inside me faster each time. His right hand began its work on my breasts.
