"Suck. Yes, that's nice, but I can't. I'm not ready, and we'll go in the others bathroom later. You can't."</p> <p>She wasn't moving, "Yes, sir," and standing in front of me, I began sucking her breasts. Oh, the feel of them, her nipple, and the silken touch of her skin against mine. She was so smooth in my mouth, and I could hear and smell her breathing. Her breast, so full, and the scent of her perfume. I loved it. It really seemed to be her.</p> <p>"Do you like having your tits played with, sir?"</p> <p>"Yes," I was breathing so hard, it was all a struggle. I was very near to coming, and she was moving, moving very close.</p> <p>"My, you have a big, hard big penis. What does a girl like a girl like that like? But you don't have any idea yet. Your penis, sir?"</p> <p>My mind was like a flash. I'd come before, just on my own skin, in the shower, but she had me on the point of no return.</p> <p>"What do I like about you, sir, like the way you eat, and suck me," she said, her voice soft and sexy, "and then make my pussy so tight, I can't stand for long. Make your wife be so well trained. I've had more practice. You like to see it, sir, you like to see a new woman, a lot better, sir? Do you like the way my pussy got so wet when I had you there in the hallway. Have you ever thought what a pussy looks like when all wet, sir?"</p> <p>I had never thought about my wife's pussy, nor had I ever been very interested, but in the room, the girl, and I, we made love, as he had never done, and she kept me hard all the time.</p> <p>"Yes, I like it, and you like it, and it's all yours, sir." I was starting to feel dizzy from my lust, and the feeling of arousal.</p> <p>"Tell me, sir. Tell me if I'm going to do to you what I had to, and do now," she said. She had lifted one breast and was kissing, lapping at the stiffened nipple, and licking it hard with her tongue.</p> <p>"What? Don't stop. Don't you know what a woman likes?"</p> <p>She smiled at me and took the hard nipple between her fingers and lightly bit it. "Yes, sir, and I like it. Just keep going. See, it likes my mouth, sir. Use your mouth, sir. Do to me what you like, what you like. "</p> <p>Yes, yes.</p> <p>"How about it?" She leaned a little closer, and I could now see the fullness of her breasts, the fullness of her breast, like two ripe strawberries in my palm. I was about to take one of those into my mouth, and suck on it, for real, and feel it grow and grow into my hands. As I did, I saw her legs fall open and she moved closer into my arms, and her leg began to rub against my erection. She was smiling at me.</p> <p>"Do to me, how you like, sir? Tell me how you like, sir." She held me there, as I felt her breath on my cheek: the scent of her perfume. Then she moved to the bed where I had laid down; I saw on the pillow where I had left my pillow. In it, on her flat tummy, was a big, blue rose petal, with a red cap, and the stems in each on it, and two of them standing in the middle of the rose petal, each side of the stem were a wide red rose, in a tiny rosette; it had a large, very deep red thatch surrounding it's center on the stem. The petals were round, and were pink from the heat of the sun, and the inside of the petals were a deep purple from the temperature. "Tell me," she said, "do you like the petals on my breasts?" I just stared at them, at the rose petals, at their dark purple around the petals. She turned first towards me and kissed me on the mouth. "Do you like them, sir?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>She looked at me, "Take off your robeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
