The party was finally about to begin so he walked over to it, sat in the center of it, waited several moments until the sound of the clinking of chains and the clinking of chains began to fill the room. Then he picked up his phone, rang the doorbell, and waited.</p> <p>A soft voice answered the door. It was Gwen. "Hi Gwen, I thought I would let you in but I was worried something might happen."</p> <p>"A lot can happen when you get older. I'm afraid it's because you're so beautiful." Gwen giggled. "My name is Gwen, meet my friend, Ann."</p> <p>The doorbell rang again. Gwen went and opened it. Ann took her time letting everyone in before she walked in. Then she looked at the clock.</p> <p>"Wow I thought I was going to be there all night. I wish mine had a lot more time. I was going to be late, but since you're here I guess I can just keep going." He held his hands up to say it.</p> <p>Gwen came into the room. "I'm sorry you couldn't come. I had to go to the doctor last week. He got back early. He's an old man and he said he was pretty sure we're going to be able to help one another."</p> <p>"Well you don't have to wait. I'm pretty sure we can do all kinds of things. We have everything you need. Now get out. Ann can I help with something?" They headed out the door.</p> <p>"I'm so nervous, but I'm going to go with you. We have so much to do."</p> <p>They took their time talking. Before long, Gwen saw the chair they were in was made for someone, and she wondered if they had been there already. She made her way out to the back where it was. The man waiting to greet them was the man who had told her she could come. There were others waiting in other places around the room. They stood at the back of the room.</p> <p>As soon as she was sure the man was at the front of the room, she felt an arm touch her leg. She knew who it was that ran up her left leg and down her thigh. His hand ran along her leg, and she shivered slightly, but no one else came. His hand slid up to her thigh and her skirt fell down. His hand gently pulled her skirt up, exposing she panties. He pulled down his jacket.</p> <p>"Come with me," Gwen said.</p> <p>The first thing he did was open her eyes. She had seen them before.</p> <p>When she was alone, a hand reached in and pulled her panties down and stepped back.</p> <p>They stood with her skirt on a chair that was almost right, with her still sitting on the chair. The man held her hand out and her foot went to step out of it. Her legs parted as she did and he pulled the skirt even further down. He pulled her panties out of the way and put them on a chair beside her clothes.</p> <p>She saw a couple of men standing there watching her but they weren't interested in her. Her eyes were closed as she leaned back against her arm, and her arms crossed her chest.</p> <p>She realized that this wasn't very professional, but the man was looking at her from behind. He took one of her hands and put it on the chair. It was warm in there and he rubbed her fingers along the thin fabric, causing her to squirm.</p> <p>"What's wrong Gwen? You're not the only one who's getting pretty excited. I think we should just get out of here."</p> <p>"No, don't get too carried away. I'm a married woman, you're just old, and someone's going to notice."</p> <p>Gwen stepped away from him and opened the door. As she stepped out, she noticed that the man had taken off his pants and was holding them in his hand. He had an enormous erection, and was stroking it.</p> <p>"Gwen, what's happening here? Is someone touching me?"</p> <p>"Yes it's me, and I don't want to scare you." She looked around the room, and saw several men watching her. "Gwen, what's going on in here?"</p> <p>She couldn't see them. She knew they were looking at her, but she couldn't move. "What do you think you're doing here?"</p> <p>"Gwen, I'm only human. There's no one here to see it, and I'm afraid that if you tell anyone that I'm here you'll put a stop to it."</p> <p>Gwenâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
