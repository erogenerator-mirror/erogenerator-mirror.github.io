But she just hung on to his neck, never moving. The two could talk and talk, without breaking eye contact. When she began to bob her head in his lap, and he knew that she sensed his excitement, he gave a little nod. Her mouth was going up and down harder than before and, as her head went from his knee to his crotch, she felt his pubic hair tickle her nose, then her teeth, and then her throat.</p> <p>He could feel his cock throb and swell as she did this for him and he wanted desperately to be near and feel her mouth on him. He pulled her a few inches off and watched as her cheeks bulged over the length of him, then he felt her nose press against his hip bone. She held her head like that long enough and moved back and up his cock while moving all of him with her hand and face. He reached out and took her cheeks in his hands and pulled them to open her up a little more. Their lips met in a passionless kiss. They didn't speak, they just held each other, and their breathing came out in long slow ragged kisses as he slid his cock between her soft, moist lips and gently pressed against them.</p> <p>"Fuck me." She murmured. Her voice was a whisper, but he could tell by her movements that she was responding. He knew what she wanted. He took those hips up off the bench and pulled her close again. Her arms went around his neck and she arched her upper body for him. He felt his cock slide up her slit so that her clit just touched his waist.</p> <p>"Yes." She whispered. "Fuck me."</p> <p>Their lips came apart again, and she said, "Is that better?"</p> <p>"Yes." He answered, his whole body pulsing.</p> <p>A warm feeling radiated from between them and ran up his shaft, and down his ball sack. As he moved into position between her legs, he watched his cock sliding up and down the pink, swollen lips.</p> <p>"Do you ever go this far?" She asked.</p> <p>"Do you?" He asked. They began to slowly fuck, moving slowly.</p> <p>"Not to this." She said, as her hands came up and placed one on his chest, feeling the muscles. Her other hand reached forward and slid in his chest and across to cover his. She wanted to play like this, to be in control of him and to control what they did. He knew that she wanted him to cum again; he wanted to cum in her, in hers. But he wanted to be in control. And he wanted her, too. But not just this time. Tonight was for him to take control, because he wanted to get her off.</p> <p>In this final movement, he was buried in her, feeling the smooth, tight walls of her slit envelope his flesh on every stroke and every move of his body. Her thighs wrapped around him, lifting her pelvis off the bench so that her pussy pushed against him and began to slide against him in a rhythmic motion. He could feel her pussy heat and wetness, and it only made him more determined to make her cum, to fuck her until he couldn't tell if she was cumming in his arms or out in her arms. He was sure, too, that her climax was coming just inches from being released into the space between them—but it wasn't enough to make her cum and make her happy. As soon as the word left his lips there, she was screaming and sobbing, and it had no effect on him. It was a release in itself that was more wonderful than anything else that he'd ever felt.</p> <p>Even though he was still hard, he knew that he couldn't cum until he was hard again. He knew that the time wasn't right, but he just wanted to be close. And he wanted to do it again.</p> <p>"You're still hard, though." She said when they finally came together. "Good."</p> <p>"I hope you didn't feel that." He said.</p> <p>"No."</p> <p>He leaned down and pressed his lips against her cheek. "And it was better than good, wasn't it?" There was no need to ask permission. He did feel better than that. And he was going to fuck her again. If she were ready to let him. He knew that she was, but he was afraid that it might make it too intense for her and she wouldn't want another man. He wanted her to feel good, to be in control of their sex life and to be happy in it.</p> <p>She looked up at him and smiled.</p> <p>"I think that's an excellent idea."</p> <p>"Yeah—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
