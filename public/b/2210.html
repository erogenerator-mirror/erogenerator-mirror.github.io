Then she started laughing.</p> <p>After saying that a number of times, Karyn finished her sentence and said, "Well now I get the idea! I will have to find a way to teach you both how to use your toys!"</p> <p>When Karyn finished laughing, she said, "But, I still have one thing to do first."</p> <p>"Ok, but first I need to have you take a bath."</p> <p>"I thought you said I could use one!"</p> <p>"Well, well, well! Well, what are you waiting for. Take your bath and have one of them ready before you go to work!"</p> <p>"Well, I don't want to start any fights with you. I know I'm your cousin, but I need to pee." Karyn said as she looked at the toilet. It wasn't going to be long before she had her pee all over that stupid, dirty, evil-fungus toilet.</p> <p>She sat there wondering what the heck she was going to do. She had to decide whether to start now with her bath instead. If she waited for awhile, it would be because something wasn't right. She got out of her clothes to take the bath and started to relieve herself. She wondered if she could ever pee with a toilet until she got back to her room. The thought of peeing in front of Karyn was starting to drive her crazy with lust.</p> <p>She started with her hands and feet and worked her way up to her boobs. She was just about to go to heaven when Karyn came out of the bathroom.</p> <p>"Well, well, you're finally getting back to normalcy Karyn! I still don't believe what we just did."</p> <p>"What happened to 'normalcy'?"</p> <p>"Well, I'm an exhibitionist and have been for a few years now. So I started to fantasize about what might be done next."</p> <p>"Well, how did we do that?"</p> <p>"Well, we did something really naughty on our first day at the beach. The second week we were on the ship, I had my top off and was letting my roommate rub my breasts. I asked my roommate to take the top off so we were totally alone. I think I actually blushed when my roommate started rubbing my nipples."</p> <p>"Well, at that point, my roommate started really rubbing my breasts. It didn't seem like she was really being intimate with me."</p> <p>"Well, one day we were on our way back to my room and the other roommate came and stood over me. I was sitting on her bed facing her roommate. She was wearing that little tank top I bought her the week before. I was rubbing her nipples when she started to rub down into the crotch of my bikini. She rubbed a lot of the panties that she got me because I was rubbing her crotch. I felt her pussy get even juicier when I started to rub her bare pussy. She was really getting herself going." Karyn said.</p> <p>"She just sat on the bed right next to me, her breasts pressed against my arm. My roommate started rubbing her pussy all over my thigh right next to me."</p> <p>"How were you dressed?"</p> <p>"I was still wearing my skirt. I guess I went commando. We had a lot of fun, but we're definitely not going to go any further with our little fantasy," Karyn responded. "My roommate is standing right next to me. We looked pretty happy with each other for a few seconds."</p> <p>"Why didn't you just go for the bikini?"</p> <p>"Well, you had a skirt on," Karyn said looking puzzled.</p> <p>"No, I thought we would go au naturel today."</p> <p>"Well, if you'd just go for the bikini, we would have gone out without a bra or panties. You did a fantastic job in the pool."</p> <p>"You mean you're not kidding when you say you have a bikini ready?"</p> <p>"No, not really. Since you're still not wearing panties, we're going to just go for the nude beach."</p> <p>"Nude beach?"</p> <p>"Right now. Right now we are at the water's edge."</p> <p>Karyn reached out and took the water's edge and pulled it. She turned to face Karyn and said. "Come on! You're on!"</p> <p>Karyn quickly slid her bathing suit bottom off and her panties followed in just a couple of seconds. They left both topless with a little water in between. Karyn put a towel on the edge of her desk to catch their wet, naked bodies.</p> <p>Karyn said, "We don't have much time to sit there, but since we're not sure where we want to go when we're doneâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
