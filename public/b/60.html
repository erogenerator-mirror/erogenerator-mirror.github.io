Maybe you could be a little more aggressive."</p> <p>"I will just have to be quiet." She leaned forward and hugged me and her lips met mine. "Thank you, it just felt so good." My hands reached up and cupped her breast, and I could feel the soft flesh. She responded by opening her mouth and our tongues touched. It was unlike any kiss I had ever experienced. Our tongues began to stroke each other's. I began to caress down her front, letting my hand slip away to her navel. My hand lingered there, slowly tracing a soft trail down her belly. Her breathing came in short little gasps and her breasts seemed to rise and fall with each breath.</p> <p>I felt my cock stir, and I pulled back from her. Her eyes were closed, and she was breathing deeply.</p> <p>"Are you sure you do not want to do this with a stranger in the same apartment?"</p> <p>"No. I don't care if you do anything. I want this." She took my hand and brought it to her other breast.</p> <p>"Would that be so bad, if I did not want to?" She looked directly at me, as if asking my permission.</p> <p>"That might be bad."</p> <p>"Yes. I guess you know that that is not true. We just don't want to take things too far."</p> <p>"It's up to you."</p> <p>I slowly removed my clothes slowly and deliberately so that she followed suit. When I stepped out of my shorts, she stopped me and placed her hands on my thighs.</p> <p>"This is not exactly the first time anything like this has happened to you. You know that I love your body." She ran her hands up my legs, slowly pushing my erection into me. "Would you like me to continue this in a more romantic setting?"</p> <p>"I need that, right here, right now." I lifted her up as my hands explored her curves.</p> <p>"Let's move to the bedroom."</p> <p>We sat on the bed on the other side of the room from where I sat. Her breasts were pushed up proudly. Her hands gently cupped mine, but I did not feel the same urgency as before.</p> <p>We pulled up her blouse and removed it. She reached up, undid my shirt at the top, and slid the straps to my shoulders. She leaned forward, her lips kissing my chest, her hands caressing my arms. After a long time, she took a nipple into her mouth, and bit gently. The pain was still apparent, but when its sensitivity rose, it was pleasant. Her tongue licked around my pink nub and then she sucked it deep into her mouth. I arched my back and tried to reach for her, as my hands grasped her head.</p> <p>"You are a wonderful kisser," I whispered.</p> <p>"Yes my sweet."</p> <p>Her hand slid between my thighs, and her fingers stroked up my belly and touched the head of my cock. I raised my hips off the bed, trying to reach her hand. She gently brushed my fingertip away from my head.</p> <p>"Don't think about it."</p> <p>"Sorry, it's just that it took you so long to say anything."</p> <p>"It wasn't that long to say something."</p> <p>"It was much more than that. I want to see what you think. You have such nice legs." She smiled at me and placed her palms on my inner thighs. "You are beautiful."</p> <p>"I really am yours." I watched her breasts rise and fall as she spoke. "You have the most beautiful legs."</p> <p>I reached out towards her. I slipped my hands under her skirt and lifted it as she stepped out of it. For a moment, I was speechless, just watching her undress in front of me.</p> <p>"I can't believe I just did that." I took a step forward, stopping in front of her.</p> <p>She reached for my hard cock and moved closer. I had trouble breathing, "I don't believe this is happening." I was barely breathing hard myself.</p> <p>She reached out and ran her fingers over my body. She took my hands in hers, and placed them on her stomach. I slid them slowly downwards, my hands exploring up her body. She was not disappointed.</p> <p>My fingers ran across her abdomen and lightly brushed the underside of her breasts. I could feel both of her fingers in my hands. I felt their soft flesh. Her breasts were rising on her chest as my thumbs stroked the nipples.</p> <p>She lifted herself and pressed me down. I felt her hot body on mine, pressing her full breasts against me as my hands moved down.
