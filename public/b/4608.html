It's quite uncomfortable and you're not comfortable in your present state." He turned back to me. "What's with you, missy? Do you not know what to call you?"</p> <p>"It's all right," I replied with a weak smile and a small shake of my head.</p> <p>"What do you do when you have to go, sweetie?" he asked while he slid a hand down to cup my ass, gently kneading my cheeks and working them up and down, making me squirm with excitement. "Why don't you go for a swim, sweetie? You'll see how comfortable you are with this. It makes your first experience as a young man. Besides, it's not a long one."</p> <p>I nodded my consent. It would make too much sense, and I had to be careful with my language. As I made my way to the poolside, I glanced at my watch and it was after one. I figured I'd be spending some time in there with my new lover. My lover. I needed to shower and change before I went home. That was only a few blocks away.</p> <p>I pulled off my sunglasses and climbed into the pool feeling much younger than old. I swam for a bit before climbing out and sitting on the edge of the pool. I glanced around for my suit, which I'd pulled on, and settled on one of the lounge chairs, which gave me a great view of my long lean form. I could just make out the outline of my cock as I began to undress. When I took my own shorts off, I did so without looking back. I quickly slipped the bikini underthings I'd put on earlier, the fabric barely covering the area between my cock and balls. I was a little embarrassed about what I wore, but at the same time, a big part of me couldn't believe that I was taking off my swim trunks and exposing my hard-on.</p> <p>My mind went back to that first time with my girlfriend, Amanda. It wasn't that she was my first and her girlfriend was the one who introduced me to my sexual desires. She was a very attractive woman, with full, firm, curvy, woman-beast skin and sparkling green eyes. Her skin was flawless. As I looked closer at her, I realized that my cock was straining against the fabric of my trunks and that it was beginning to come out. I turned around, a smile on my face. I was now facing her, enjoying her beauty, with great confidence. I'd never felt so bold as I did now.</p> <p>A warm, wet sensation began to trail down my inner thigh as my cock began to stiffen up. I felt the coolness of the water hit my shaft as it stiffened, and I turned my body so that I could put one knee on the seat. I could feel the water on my cock, which felt smooth and refreshing. The warm water felt wonderful against my skin.</p> <p>"Do you always keep your man waiting?" she said with a lilt to her voice. "Do you have to be so fucking shy?"</p> <p>I looked down into the pool, unable to believe that we were even talking. "I just don't..."</p> <p>"Well, maybe the boy will get a little..." she said with a coy smile.</p> <p>I nodded and we both giggled. "Now, you better take it easy on this. The first time a girl you meet goes in there and you're all alone?" I laughed with my girlfriend. "I promise I'll try to be more than that, okay. And besides, you're such a gentleman. The girls at the other side of the pool are all hot, too." I assured her that I really didn't mind that the girls at this resort got the attention and that this resort really enjoyed that.</p> <p>"Oh thank you," she replied with a kiss and a mischievous twinkle in her eyes. Her eyes glimmered and sparkled with her lovely blue eyes. "We really need to get you into your shorts, though. No wonder you're so hard." As she said this, she gave my cock a squeeze. "We don't have time to get you down to your shorts." I reached down and helped her out of the pool while still trying to cover myself. She grabbed my t-shirt from the side of the pool and we stepped into the hot tub.</p> <p>"Let's go inside and change," she suggested taking her own clothes off. We got out of the hot tub, each of us in our towels and I was taking my own while she grabbed the robe she'd worn earlier. On the way to her bedroom, she stopped and turned on the light. I couldn't fathom why she was doing this but then I wondered the same about herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
