I rubbed her cheek and ran my hand up to her shoulder. We kissed. I ran my fingers down her arm.</p> <p>"I like that."</p> <p>"Do you, too? I want to feel you bare and beautiful."</p> <p>"Absolutely," Rachel said. "I'm yours, Mike. You will feel good in my body, in your mouth."</p> <p>Her eyes were still on me. The smile in them sent a charge across my heart. She reached between us and caressed me. I wanted to take the rest of her clothes off. I wanted to feel her skin against mine, feel her breasts and her belly. We broke for air. I was ready to say something, anything, but I thought better of it than to say anything. I put a finger on her lips and gently pulled her on top of me. She straddled my chest and grabbed my cock through my pants. I could have come there too.</p> <p>"You're hard for me," she told me in a low voice. Her legs opened wide for me and I felt the heat coming from her sex. Her pussy pressed against my cock. I lifted my hips to try to fit it in. She reached down and pulled me out. I felt a twinge of frustration at the delay. Rachel was hot. She was all mine. I was going to need a lot of practice. She lay down and rubbed her clitoris. I lay and stared. She moved down, rubbing her nipples from top to bottom. I felt myself sliding into her, my cock filling her. Rachel moaned. I stopped.</p> <p>"That was nice," I told her. "I want my cock in you."</p> <p>"Me too," she said. I was tempted to just lie with her for a long time. But I didn't. I rolled onto my side and put my arms around her. She cuddled up to me. We lay together as we were falling asleep in minutes. It didn't matter that time had come. I didn't want to spend every minute thinking about it. We both fell asleep.</p> <p>-----</p> <p>I woke when I heard the beeping of my bed. Rachel was still asleep, but it was far gone. My cock was rock hard while my hand massaged it. Maybe I was dreaming, but I couldn't be sure. I slid my fingers down to Rachel's pussy and felt her wetness. I didn't think I'd need another toy though. I climbed on over her and went back to work. Rachel opened her eyes and smiled that sexy smile. I ran my hand up and down her breast while massaging her nipple with my thumb. Rachel opened her eyes again, looked at me, and gave me a dreamy smile. I started off slow. First, I slid down and kissed, then licked, then kissed and licked my way down her belly.</p> <p>"I woke up a minute ago," Rachel said softly. I looked at her, her head turned. She had dreamt of me, dreamt of me tasting her. I licked at her belly, then took a break from licking, to kiss my way around. Her hands were on my head, my arms, my hands. I lifted my head up and kissed her again before going back down. I kissed her stomach, her chest, her sides, all the way to her breasts. I kissed them, gently, licks, and suckles. I kissed her nipples and sucked them into my mouth. I licked under them with my tongue. I licked down across her stomach, along her thighs to her pussy. She spread her pussy, I licked her, and she had a look of lust. I licked her again, up and down, over and over, until she was crying out again. I teased her clit, and she was begging me to put my cock in her. I spread her lips and ran the head up and down. I loved the look on her face and the way she was holding herself up. I slid my cock slowly inside. It hurt, but it was pleasure at the same time. Her legs wrapped around me and pulled me, until I was completely inserted. I started kissing her, and working my way down to her tits. I kissed her as I went, pulling back as she pushed back with each stroke. She was loving it, her hips were moving in time with me. When I was halfway there, she was going off again. I kept going until she went over the top again. I kept going until we were both coming. I felt her pussy tighten around my cock. She let go of my head and I put mine in her pussy while we both cried out.</p> <p>Afterwards, we laid around before I put my clothes on. My cock still in her. We cuddled, holding each other as we went to sleep.</p> <p>-----â€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
