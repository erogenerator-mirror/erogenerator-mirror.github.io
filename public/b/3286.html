I held up the hem of my dress. I looked, with my eyes, at my penis.</p> <p>"I could tell from his breathing," I offered.</p> <p>"Maybe he's just taking it in stride," she answered matter-of-factly.</p> <p>I felt my pulse pound in my ears and blood rushed from within my head. My heart raced and my stomach crinkled at what I had just experienced. It was the moment of truth, the moment of love, the moment of commitment. The point of no return.</p> <p>"That's amazing, Honey," she gushed, "and so beautiful as well."</p> <p>"I've never had love come true," I said truthfully, feeling more than I wanted to in my state of euphoria.</p> <p>My girlfriend looked up at me and pulled me toward her. Our lips met in a series of soft and delicate kisses, while my hands slipped down her back to her ass. As the kiss ended, she pulled away and raised her finger to my mouth. "It's time for us to go to bed," she whispered seductively.</p> <p>"We can't," I whispered back, confused by the fact that I felt the need to return the closeness of our kiss.</p> <p>"It's time, baby."</p> <p>The thought of getting naked together with my girlfriend in a bed filled me with anticipation of the day ahead. We were alone in an elevator and I knew it was time. My mind told me to push it further and to go all out. I didn't. All I could do was watch her and imagine us. A tear began to form in the corner of my eye, but I managed to contain it.</p> <p>She led me gently by the hand to her bedroom. We stepped inside the door, and she shut it behind us.</p> <p>"I didn't mean to say that," she said softly with her fingertips running up my arm.</p> <p>"It's okay, Honey, you're so beautiful, I could kiss you long and hard." I looked in the mirror and saw us both staring into one. We were both amazed at ourselves; at how we had met. We had embraced and been loved. We were truly in love. We had made our way to where the universe held us and where there was more of us. I felt good there, too. Even now, in the arms of my lover, I felt good too. What we had just shared, we had made together and loved at the same time.</p> <p>As we sat down on the bed and put our hands around each other, I felt a calmness wash over me, as if we had been born in a fairy tale. We were both at peace with what the world knew of the other, with what was not there.</p> <p>I kissed her ear and whispered, "We never did say goodbye, but I don't think it's something we can just forget."</p> <p>"I don't think either of us could forget, lover," my girlfriend said as sensually as she could. "There's no one you could regret for ever. You're mine, and I'm yours, and you're safe as well as loved. Nobody in my life can ever lose you."</p> <p>"That's true," I said, pulling her to me.</p> <p>We kissed and cuddled. I caressed my fingers through her hair as we kissed, and she sighed contentedly against my lips. I felt as if I was going to explode.</p> <p>The passion on the bed was so beautiful and so perfect, that we soon fell into a soft, contented slumber. Our bodies touched as we lay together, holding each other in our arms.</p> <p>"Where are you going to sleep?" I asked, "I don't want to leave you here tonight - alone?"</p> <p>"Don't worry about it," she agreed, "I just need to get some more rest."</p> <p>We spooned together again, and I held her in my arms. The smell of rose petals filled the room. In a dream, I knew this was where we were going to go to sleep. I drifted off.</p> <p>Sometime later in the morning, we arose early and went to bed. I was a bit unsure about sleeping, as I had never done it before, but I enjoyed the company of an otherwise perfect girlfriend.</p> <p>I opened the closet and removed a thin blanket from the closet, covering our nude bodies. I put down the blanket for modesty, and sat down on the bed with my back turned toward where I had dropped the blanket.</p> <p>My girlfriend turned on all fours and I could see her lovely curvy ass cheeks just barely above the covers. She turned back and we stared at each other.
