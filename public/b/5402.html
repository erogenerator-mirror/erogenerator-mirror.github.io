I said, trying to keep the fear out of my voice.</p> <p>"Just a little excited. How many times have you looked back and seen that smile," she said with a giggle.</p> <p>"I...well...I don't know...like...well...maybe three?"</p> <p>"You are so cute. I'm glad it is you."</p> <p>"Yeah...you...you are always a good boy. You got to keep me safe or I could die."</p> <p>She ran her hand over her face with a sly grin. "My fault, I knew if I did that to you in the car or anywhere I could have gotten my hand in your pants."</p> <p>I was starting to get scared, but I knew better than to say anything to break her mind-blowing mood. With another smile, she grabbed my hand and led me to her house.</p> <p>She didn't tell me where we went, and I didn't get a chance to ask. "Shit, this place is a mess" I thought as she ran up the winding steps. She was so beautiful.</p> <p>"You ready?" she asked as she grabbed a bottle of alcohol.</p> <p>"Yeah...it's a big house. Can I...can I get it ready?" I asked.</p> <p>I think she saw how scared I was, but smiled anyway and nodded as she reached to her coat and grabbed a pen. "Okay, get the fucking place ready."</p> <p>She nodded and took two steps. "Don't worry, it will be clean in no time."</p> <p>"Thanks. What are you drinking? What kind?"</p> <p>Denny smiled and picked up a bottle of white wine. "I don't know, it's...um...I didn't mean..." She frowned as she looked at me.</p> <p>"What if me," she asked, and I nodded.</p> <p>She took another glass and raised it to him.</p> <p>"What are you drinking?"</p> <p>"Rum and coke mixed with some juice."</p> <p>"Rum and coke? You want me to have some?" She had always known as I did, but this seemed a little forward. Now, she was being honest.</p> <p>"Yeah, I guess this will help."</p> <p>"Thanks. I don't usually drink this," she said, holding up a glass.</p> <p>"So I did," I laughed.</p> <p>"No, it's no fun and no fun" she laughed. "Drink wine," she said as she held up another glass.</p> <p>"So... where do you want me?"</p> <p>"I think right here." She smiled and turned around, putting the glass back on the table. "You want some wine?" When she smiled at me, I smiled back and nodded yes.</p> <p>"Right here, drink it, then get some wine!"</p> <p>She took a sip and held the glass out to him. He did the same.</p> <p>"Here, take it for yourself." She handed him her glass then stood.</p> <p>He took it and set it down. I looked at her. She took another sip and held out her hand. "Come on."</p> <p>"Are you sure?" he asked.</p> <p>"Absolutely!"</p> <p>"We aren't drunk yet." She smiled at him and sat down on the couch. "Help yourself" she said, and took the wine glass from him.</p> <p>He poured her wine, and leaned over and picked it up. He handed her glass to her, then poured another. I moved to them and sat down at the table, but she didn't take it the first time. He sat down next to her. They both took another sip of wine, then she leaned over and kissed me. Her kiss was amazing. She took another sip before reaching to my lips, pulling me up and breaking away.</p> <p>"I love how you kiss me." She said with a grin.</p> <p>"It's a very beautiful kiss!"</p> <p>"And so romantic in a very, very, very sexual way," she said as she took another sip.</p> <p>Now we were both getting a kick out of this.</p> <p>I was feeling a little better after our kiss, and it wasn't because of all the wine.</p> <p>She kissed me again and smiled. "Now, we have to dance" she said as she took her purse from her arms and opened it.</p> <p>"Are you sure?" I said as she took out the bottle of wine that I had already opened and set it down beside us. I took a second sip and handed the wine to her. I could feel her lips brushing against my as she took a drink from the glassâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
