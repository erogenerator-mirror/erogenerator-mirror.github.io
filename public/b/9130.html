She unbuttoned her blouse and revealed her bra.</p> <p>He walked up to her and embraced her. They kissed, deeply, lovingly, passionately, until both knew where their lives would lead and where their relationship ended.</p> <p>"I had no idea it would be this good," she said softly. "I've never been this happy. I just love the fact that you're still living as a single college student with a new roommate. It was like a dream come true. How would I have felt if I didn't have you in my life?</p> <p>"That's how I've been feeling ever since I first saw you, and the last two weeks I've tried to tell myself that the sex was the best thing since I started college in the first place."</p> <p>"The sex is always the best way of making you happy," he continued. "It's a part of your life that you could always make a change in. You've changed many things in your life. But until you can find a partner in this crazy new world that you can't even begin to feel happy with anymore - now that you've met that new love and being free of those who had your heart."</p> <p>He lifted his hands up to the back of her head and caressed it a bit more.</p> <p>"So, you're a woman now; you can start doing everything you want."</p> <p>"I'm not sure I can do everything," she responded.</p> <p>He moved her head towards his crotch. She slowly lowered it until the tip of his penis was inches within reach, and she kissed it.</p> <p>He guided hers onto his cock, feeling her warmth as it brushed itself off his shaft.</p> <p>"Wow."</p> <p>"This is unbelievable," she breathed, "I can't believe how amazing it feels."</p> <p>Without thinking, she unbuttoned her pants and slid them off her hips. She lifted her ass and pulled them off. She lay on top of him, facing his feet, while he ran his hands down her long, lovely legs and feet and finally over her calves and knees.</p> <p>It seemed like forever before he made his way upward. His hands began their ascent to her thighs. His hands made it all the way up her smooth legs to her mound. He rubbed his fingers up and down, all the way to her mound and then back down again. His fingers dipped in and back out of her vagina, then up again.</p> <p>He found the hooded ridge of her clitoris and started with light touches of the tips. Her nipples reacted to the sensations.</p> <p>He slid his hand up her body to the waistline of her undies, which were only held up by two thin threads of fabric. He reached around the sides of an undies band, which clung to her belly just below her breasts, and slid it through the band. She let out a small gasp as he pulled it slowly over her breast. He pulled it up, and she let it drop.</p> <p>He kissed her thighs as he took the fabric of her undies between his teeth and drew it back slowly, revealing more and more of her skin. Finally, as he felt the softness of her pubic hair, he slid it over the tip of his penis until the tip of the head was exposed, which he caressed with his thumb.</p> <p>"You're such a slut," she remarked.</p> <p>"You're so sexy," he cooed into her skin-tightening panties. She didn't say anything. He leaned forward and slid them off, then kissed her thighs as he continued to gently tease the soft folds of her vagina. Her legs opened wider and her pussy glistened in front of him. He had never felt the feel of an orgasm like that before.</p> <p>"You're really going to get it tonight, you know," he said to her after removing the panties.</p> <p>"That feels great," she cooed.</p> <p>She leaned her head back and brought her hands to her breasts and touched and squeezed them as he continued to gently massage her clit. He could tell she was on the verge for release.</p> <p>"You wanna come?" he asked, softly, his breath washing over her.</p> <p>She shook her head.</p> <p>"I wanna come, too," she explained.</p> <p>"I wanna come too," he replied.</p> <p>* * * *</p> <p>He pushed aside her legs and slid her legs to her stomach. His erection slid out of her body as he did soâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
