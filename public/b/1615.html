I also didn't want to put any of the stress of the last few days in my head.</p> <p>We got dressed and I said good night, we kissed and I left.</p> <p>I couldn't believe that I was still attracted to that little hottie, and I was determined not to let her think that she was my problem.</p> <p>****</p> <p>It was a little after 3am by the time I got home. I tried to keep my mind on the job, but it was a long and grueling long day. I had to admit that I liked seeing Michelle in her lingerie. It gave me a good thrill to think that all those things could have been on any guy's mind.</p> <p>Later that day when Michelle knocked on my door I answered it, I stood there in front of her trying to get her to give up her work. She was nervous. I waited until she looked at me and with a half-smile said, "I need to see you again." It seemed like seconds before "I'm so sorry for getting too carried away, "I told her, "Let's make supper together. I need to get to work." She stood there until I escorted her to the door.</p> <p>When we got inside she gave me a confused look; "We didn't even say 'hi'?" she didn't understand what she just said.</p> <p>I smiled at her, "I thought I told you how my business is going." She finally saw that it was more of a statement. "It's getting late. My boss is leaving for a meeting in a few minutes. If you would care to join him and maybe join us for supper? I know some of these restaurants up in the mountains." I really wanted her to say something nice to him. "Maybe we could all go take a walk down to the town and see what our favorite place is, "I'm sure that there is a pub just a minute up the road. It seems like you were hoping to find someone you really liked. I'm sure your mind wasn't on that. I would love to go with you up there anyway." She knew what I meant and she agreed.</p> <p>As we went up the stairs to the dining room, I told her that I was feeling a little tired. I was almost glad for the drink but we did need to get a little dinner prepared. The supper was very enjoyable and I would have been glad to oblige if she had asked me to.</p> <p>When we got out of the dining room I asked her if maybe we would go out to the park to play a game. When she thought that I was joking, she said, "Maybe." She would give me a few minutes or an hour. If she did not want to come, it was not a problem. I did have plans so I decided that I would enjoy her company a little more.</p> <p>We had a wonderful supper. It was a romantic and relaxing evening and I couldn't believe that I was still attracted to a sexy babe. After we had finished eating we went into the living room and I started a movie. She looked like she was going to say something, but instead looked at the TV and said,</p> <p>"I need to work a little longer this evening, "I didn't know what she wanted to do so I asked her if she wanted to go to bed but she didn't. She walked into my room and closed the door.</p> <p>I wanted to tell her that she was great. It made me feel good knowing that she was enjoying herself so much, and I also wanted her to do to me what I had just done to her.</p> <p>I told her that she was just doing so well with the role she was developing in her body that she was enjoying herself so much. This was her first time doing something so kinky. I really loved it.</p> <p>I had her lay on the center of my king sized bed in the middle of my bedroom. I got behind her, my lips found hers and then I licked her lips and her neck. My hands went around and under her top, pulling up her bra so that her breast could be exposed, my hands went to her sides and I pushed up her skirt.</p> <p>I wanted to be able to touch her pussy. I want to feel the silken softness of it, like the softness of my lips in the snow. I started pulling down her little panties while I tried to keep kissing her neck and ear, while my hands went down and found her breasts. I wanted to suck her and make her feel good. I wanted to let her go when she really wanted to have her pussy felt good.</p> <p>Then I went back down on her neck, my tongue finding her erect nipple and flicking it.
