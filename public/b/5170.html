"I think we should move back to the party and celebrate something."</p> <p>The two of them laughed and continued their exploration of each others bodies once again. She leaned forward for a kiss, taking his cockhead into her mouth. Licking along its length and teasing by tongue against him causing him to groan. She sat back admiring his cock, his face flushed. The heat from his body, the smoothness of her skin, the thickness of his body between her legs...it was all so erotic. She slid her left hand down to her crotch and began rubbing her clit as she looked him in the eyes. It was so good to watch him.</p> <p>The pair of them stood and began walking around the house gathering their things, making their way back to the bedroom. They sat on the bed and slowly began kissing again. He laid next to her and he caressed her breasts, pulling her body into his. She began to roll over on to her front and let herself fall onto him. Their legs intertwined as he rolled to his side as his throbbing cock slid between them. She reached her hand to caress his face and hair as he cupped her breast in his hand and began massaging them with his fingers. She moaned with pleasure.</p> <p>Her hand slipped down to play with his cock in response to him rolling onto his back. Her fingers found her way to his ass and she began to probe the hole, making it moist with her juices. She moved her hand underneath him and began to caress his balls through his pants. He moaned with passion as she caressed him. Feeling him respond to her hand on his balls... she was really getting into the feeling.</p> <p>"I think you like to play with me baby." He moved down so he was lying on his back once again. She got on top of him, positioning herself above him, her breasts swinging in time to her own movements. She took his hands and placed them on her hips, slowly guiding him along the inside of her thighs. He could not touch her directly but just gently at first so that his fingers could explore her, sliding up and down her crack and her soft lips. Her hand moved to her own clit, sliding his fingers back and forth in her slick opening.</p> <p>"Mmm baby, where should we put this?" He asked.</p> <p>"In my pussy." She replied as she turned around so that her butt was facing him, her legs on his shoulders.</p> <p>She slipped down and he slid up his body to enter her once again. It was so exciting watching her. He could smell her excitement, her own muskiness. He reached his tongue out to lick her outer lips as she began to rock back and forth... He slid his hand along her folds to run his finger down the crack of her pussy. Her hand went to her clit, circling his finger as she rocked her pelvis back against his finger, driving him to greater heights of pleasure. She had her hand down on his cock and began stroking him as he gently fingered her...she was so hot and wet, so tight and hot...so inviting...but he didn't know how to tell her of his desire for her, so they continued to have a slow fuck as they both rode out the waves of passion and pleasure. She slowed down and asked again.</p> <p>"I want you to ride me with your hand. I need to cum with you on top!"</p> <p>He smiled with delight and she slowly lifted herself enough to position the tip of his cock between her lips before slowly lowering herself down on him. They both let out moans and enjoyed the feeling of the warm flesh of his shaft against her body. Slowly she started to ride him, teasing him with the lips of her pussy before sliding her body off just enough to bring them back together. They continued to fuck slow and deep, his fingers rubbing her clitoris and her breasts as they moved together. After several minutes of this, she pushed herself up straight, letting his cock slide from her pussy. She leaned down and kissed him again and again as his cock slid up and down the length of her pussy. She reached between their bodies, resting his cock on her belly as she moved back towards him. She guided it backwards slowly as her hand slid off his cock and over the tip of his cock, lubricating the cock, the head of which was coated with his pre-cum. She reached back and positioned his cock at the entrance to her slit. He slid forward just a bit as she raised herself up a bit more, taking his cock in one hand and guiding it to her opening again.</p> <p>She held him tight as she sat back down, sliding more of him into her. It was not a long hard ride but the sensation of being inside of her, the wonderful warmth of her body as it caressed him, theâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
