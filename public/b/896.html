He pushed deeper.</p> <p>"Not now?" she asked incredulously. "Not now. Just like today?" Her body pressed tightly against his as she continued the motion of his cock buried inside her.</p> <p>"Yes," he answered, pulling up and pressing her body against his.</p> <p>"Tell me how you came," and the pressure of his cock in her body built. Her breathing became more rapid.</p> <p>"I came because I love you," and he felt her body stiffen against him. "And you love me, too, don't you?" His lips found hers and soon she was sucking on his tongue once more.</p> <p>"Oh yes," she breathed against him. And then she felt the pressure of his hand gripping her ass.</p> <p>"Now?" he asked, the feeling sending a shock of electricity through her body. It started near the spot where they had left off, then grew from there. Her hips were driving into his and he was fucking her body, trying to get another powerful orgasm.</p> <p>"Yes," she managed to say, and felt the surge build up even more intense. "Yes, now, please, now." As he pressed her body down harder on his.</p> <p>"Yes," she whispered through kisses. He pulled up, his cock pulled out and she felt the void as he held his cock in her hand a second before it found her opening. They were almost there now. He rubbed her pussy as he slowly slid in and back out.</p> <p>"Oh my," she screamed, feeling his cock fill her even as it filled with blood through her nerves, and she started to pant.</p> <p>"Do you like it?" he asked, beginning to move his cock in and out of her body in long, slow strokes.</p> <p>"Yes," she said and squeezed her pussy around him.</p> <p>"Do you want it?" he asked.</p> <p>"I want it, yes. Oh, it feels so good," she purred, feeling his cock moving in and out of her body as he reached under her to grip her ass.</p> <p>"It seems so good," he answered, feeling her body move beneath him.</p> <p>"I want it, too!" she moaned. "Fuck me, don't tease me. Fuck me!"</p> <p>He pulled her up. "What?" he questioned, concerned.</p> <p>"Fuck me," she answered, and then felt him move off of her body. "I want it." She wanted it now.</p> <p>"I'm afraid we're not done," he told her, moving between her legs.</p> <p>"That I am a bitch," she laughed as he leaned in and fucked her with a powerful thrust of his hips.</p> <p>"Yes you are. I'm not even going to tease you, baby." And then he was pulling out and slamming home again. "I said I'm not trying to make you happy," he grunted, thrusting his cock back in.</p> <p>It went on and on in her body. He fucked her every hole and they had forgotten the danger of what they were doing. Their bodies were reacting all the same to that contact. Their bodies were being driven into the same end, a feeling of impending surrender, of complete satisfaction.</p> <p>Then, as if they had no control over themselves, the sensations of his movements and hers were gone, the last moment of their mutual lovemaking came. His movements slowed for seconds, and then they both felt the tension of each other build up. And then...and then it was there. Their bodies were a blur of sensation and passion. As they heard and felt the scream of the intensity of their feelings the final release came, and with it the release of their feelings of surrender.</p> <p>She felt him pull out, her pussy closing down over his cock, and the flood of her love juices spilled over it, soaking the bed, and their legs.</p> <p>They lay there, motionless for a long time, their legs intertwined, skin flushed from their exertions, then she said, "I love you," and he responded, with a grinâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
