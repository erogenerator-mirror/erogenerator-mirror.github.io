The man raised his voice to break the sexual tension. "Good choice, for starters." A woman with long auburn hair and a white collar approached the table. "Yes, Madam."</p> <p>"Ahem, I'm Anna."</p> <p>"I'm pleased to meet you, Mrs Watson." She shook my hand and asked, "May I get you a glass of wine?"</p> <p>"What's a martini?" I asked.</p> <p>"A glass of bourbon." A man held the glass out and smiled at the bartender. "And what am I allowed?"</p> <p>"A glass as well, sir." He handed her the glass. Anna stared into the glass, drinking carefully. "May I have another glass of bourbon, sir?"</p> <p>"Absolutely." Anna handed the glass back and went to the bar to refill it.</p> <p>I glanced around the room to find several couples engaged in an off-handed discussion or talking sports as the men talked and the women talked to each other about whatever topic the men wanted to talk about. I saw two males sitting near the women and one couple in particular as I stood by the bar, watching the women take the drinks from their hands.</p> <p>"Excuse me, but are you all supposed to join a room with that name on the door?" The door was open and I stepped aside, wondering why it was not locked.</p> <p>"We have a room called Bitch, so if we are going to use it, we need to be at least two people, and it's pretty damned private."</p> <p>For some reason, this was not very clear and awkward and a big part of where I was standing was thinking that it was a small establishment so no harm would come to anyone. This was not where I grew up as Anna's friend, but I learned much more about her and her husband in the last fifty odd years. "I'm sure we can find our way back to Bitch quicker than I'd like."</p> <p>The men and women returned their attention to the women. The wine and bourbon had already run down some of those lovely lips after the quick, long and enjoyable encounter they had with us in the car, and Anna had a lovely smile on her full lips as she approached. I knew she looked gorgeous in the candle light, and she looked even more as she approached us, and I saw a glimmer of the flush that I suspected would be visible. I hoped it never did.</p> <p>"You may take a seat and enjoy your drinks." She turned and walked back to her companions who were sitting at the table just outside the door. "Bitch, would you like another drink? I can make it special. "There are a few more bottles here as well."</p> <p>"Thanks Mrs Watson." The gentleman she had been chatting to earlier returned and set his empty glass down. "I'll have another martini, with a glass of ice water." He poured both glasses and offered mine to the women.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, you're looking even better." Anna smiled and kissed my cheek. "You make a handsome couple, Tom."</p> <p>"I'll put one of your glasses down so we can both sit down. I think someone might get sick for the next sixty feet or so!"</p> <p>I made my way to the bar and poured another glass of water. When I looked over, Anna was sitting on the table and the waiter was setting another glass of wine on the countertop. I smiled and looked back at Anna's face. "Thanks for taking a sip of that. "</p> <p>"Thank you, I enjoyed it. " She flashed me a look of admiration. "Would you like to join me for another sip of your drink?" She nodded her head and I quickly walked back over to the bar.</p> <p>"Is there a nice private dance floor?" The barman looked concerned as I approached, and the bartender turned his attention back to Anna's glass. "Would you feel more comfortable if we added something to the martini and mixed it for you?"</p> <p>"That sounds great." I smiled but I wasn't sure I wanted to. "I'm just nervous about some people seeing us."</p> <p>"You're not nervous are you?"</p> <p>"What? No, of course not." I was afraid I had made a big mistake. I'd felt more nervous than I felt.</p> <p>"You are nervous?"</p> <p>"I was. My last date. He put his arm around my waist and I felt a surge of comfort that made me want even lower down. I wasn't sure I even knew what sex was, but he gave me some very good sex."</p> <p>"Would you mind if I gave your friend the same kind of service?"</p> <p>Anna smiled a bit wider. "He is very goodâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
