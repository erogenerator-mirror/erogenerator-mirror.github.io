"I live here."</p> <p>He nodded in agreement and started to walk off. Just then, he turned to me and said,</p> <p>"We're leaving, aren't we? I'm going to be late."</p> <p>"Okay," I said as I closed the door and locked it.</p> <p>"I'm leaving with you. I'm a bit nervous about our evening. You need to be sure to give me a second chance."</p> <p>"You're kidding right?" I said. I couldn't believe he was even considering this.</p> <p>His tone gave me the creeps. If he even thought about looking at his body, he would be pissed off. "You're right. I should be. Just give me a minute."</p> <p>"You get into some serious trouble," he snipped as he turned to start walking back down the stairs.</p> <p>I followed suit. I was just about to follow him up when I noticed his shirt was getting a bit wet. There was also a lot of moisture down there, which I immediately saw. It looked like he must have been trying to cool off. I just went into the laundry room and grabbed a few towels and came back out.</p> <p>"Hey, I'm sorry. I'm a bit embarrassed about that."</p> <p>"You don't have any reason to be embarrassed," I replied. I had a feeling he was going to come to my defense though. I took my time picking up what I could of clean up and put the cloth back in my closet before heading out to get my purse and my car keys. As I was waiting for him to come out of the laundry room, I noticed a few large wet spots where his shirt has been wet, too.</p> <p>Just as he was about to come out of the laundry area, I stepped onto my porch. He didn't bother to turn around and walk in the door. I felt really bad that he would do that.</p> <p>"Come on in, I'm sure you're tired. Don't turn around."</p> <p>"How come you're such a pain in the ass?"</p> <p>"Nervous?" I said in an unconvincing tone of voice.</p> <p>"Is that a euphemism?" he replied. I just stared at him open mouthed.</p> <p>"How could you even suggest that?" I asked, wondering what he was thinking.</p> <p>"For the most part, no. But it's true."</p> <p>"Why would you even say that, if you are comfortable with it?"</p> <p>"Because, I'm your friend," he said laughing.</p> <p>"No," I corrected him. "But I'll bet your friends don't think we're your friends." I saw him take a quick glance into the laundry room and see those wet spots I'd noted.</p> <p>"No, they wouldn't. I mean, they like a man to see them wet," he said and smiled at me.</p> <p>Damn, he was cute. "Do you mind if I dry all the way up?" I asked him.</p> <p>"Sure," he said after I handed him my purse.</p> <p>I don't know exactly how old he was but he wasn't exactly thin. But his dark skin didn't give off any distinguishing characteristics. His arms and chest were quite bulky and I could see a slight droop to his right hip, which wasn't very feminine. I'm sure the rest of his body isn't anything to write home about.</p> <p>He handed me my purse back and said, "I'm sorry if there wasn't really something we could do here."</p> <p>"It's okay." I could feel myself taking a minute to think. "Maybe I could dry off too."</p> <p>"Maybe you could get me something?" he asked me as I handed him a fresh wet towel. The smile that he gave me was all I needed to hear. It made me feel like all I had to do was sit down and he would finish me off with his mouth. I almost felt like I was about to cum.</p> <p>"I don't know about that," I said taking over drying up. "I'm just so sorry we got involved, we've already forgotten how it is together." The words were coming out of my mouth almost as a whisper.</p> <p>Just then, when he was finished with drying up, I asked him what had come to his mind. He just shook his head and shook his head more than a little.</p> <p>"It's okay, I kind of like it," I said trying to be as subtle as he didn't like it. "How do you feel about us having an intimate moment? How does my friend feel about a man and some woman?"</p> <p>He didn't say anything. He just looked at each of us, still smiling.</p> <p>"The things we just did," he saidâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
