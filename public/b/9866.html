"No, really, you'd be surprised, they're from my sister." She smiled and I got hold of her hand to place the box between my legs. I slid my hand in so it rested flat on my lower belly, "We won't be disturbed."</p> <p>"Not to worry, I'm sure," she said pulling my hand down to touch her thigh. She had to put both arms around my waist to hold it in place for me. "Hey, you can stay, stay right here, I'm sure I'll come to see you if I can't be there. My aunt wouldn't mind. It's her thing. I'm sure mom wouldn't mind either."</p> <p>"You know she might, but it's something I have to do, get ready," I said as I looked over my shoulder. It was kind of like her cousin. Her mom wasn't very nice. She wasn't even into her father at all, but she said that she was just trying to protect me from any harm. "Besides, you already told me that you could keep in touch with Aunt Melinda."</p> <p>"Oh, right. She still hasn't asked me for anything," she said as she pulled her hand from my waist onto mine. It was actually kind of hot that morning when I saw her pull my hand down to her mound. "You're right, it wouldn't bother me if anyone saw me with my brother. That would be such a turn on. I was just a little nervous. It's never happened before. I hope it doesn't happen to me all together." Her words were very dry and devoid of any promise or meaning. She didn't believe a word of what she had said. "So we'll try to have some privacy, okay? And if it happens, its nothing that I can guarantee," she said with a little laugh.</p> <p>It was true, I could feel the heat coming off her as I held her fingers. I watched as she spread her legs open. She didn't have to move them at all. The heat was like a magnet in my heart to her heat.</p> <p>"Just give me a minute or so to change, get changed and be sure to make yourself comfortable," I said and watched as she did. I could see her hand move to her lap, but she didn't come near to my member. "I'll be right back. Just make sure those towels and my clothes aren't in the way," she said in a kind of nervous tone. I turned around to give her a quick smile and followed her outside. She came back a moment or two later holding the new bath towel.</p> <p>"I found this when I came in," she said, handing it to me. "It's pretty nice," she said as she looked at it. "It's only 8 and you've only been here four weeks," she said with a giggle.</p> <p>"Ah, yeah, it looks good," I said, trying not to take my eyes of her hand moving around the edge.</p> <p>"Well I'm not gonna be much longer, that's for sure," she said with a smile. I looked towards the door and saw dad's car out front. "Well I'm getting an early start and if I have time, I could give you a hand there."</p> <p>"I'll be fine, it shouldn't bother you, right?" I said in answer. "It's not going to bother me in the least. You know you could easily just lay here for a few more minutes."</p> <p>"But what would I have to do," she said with her eyes still fixed on her hand as she moved to lay down on the soft towel. I walked over there to get in the other one, but she said, "Hey, I'm sure you can fix it," and leaned over, her hand coming towards my face. She began to move it closer to me as she closed her eyes.</p> <p>"I can't help it. It's not going to bother you at all, is it," she said as she reached towards the towel again.</p> <p>"Don't try anything silly. I'm not going to start something about a new bath in 5 minutes." I didn't bother to argue as I pulled the towel away to reveal her full body. My eyes feasted on the beauty of her skin. It was still in the color of milky, white flesh; that creamy pink that you get when you run down the beach during the summer. It was pale yellow almost to the point of being a pale yellow.</p> <p>"Hmm," she said with a little laugh, "What's got you in such a hurry," she said as she moved her fingers against my face and her other hand came to the back of my head to keep it where she wanted it.
