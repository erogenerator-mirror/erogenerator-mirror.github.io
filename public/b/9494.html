As if to put his mind at ease, she spoke with a warm tone.</p> <p>"I'm not going to beg for the attentions of this man. But if you want what you have at home, I'm sure you'll enjoy it. After all, you might have had some friends you weren't close with that you didn't get close enough to," she teased.</p> <p>"I'm sure I'll enjoy it some, but I'm sure you'll enjoy it with all of us here. How about some wine and we can all settle down to my bed for dinner?" He winked.</p> <p>"Sure," she agreed.</p> <p>They sat around the kitchen table and talked some more. After supper, Dan and Jen sat around the dining room table while the rest of the group took a break to do all the dishes and other chores. It was a strange feeling, seeing everyone else around the table enjoying a good meal and having a relaxing drink. Jen knew she was going to miss their time together, much to the delight of all of them.</p> <p>Jen poured wine from her glass and had a glass in her other arm, sipping it as she felt her inhibitions fade. She was nervous but also excited. They had discussed these same feelings many times before, but it was always at their last meeting, when they would go out and talk about their sexual desires or lack thereof. Jen had a sense that was why Dan made the arrangements. He always had a way to make her feel comfortable, and was a good source of comfort and comfort.</p> <p>Jen's mind was already reeling at the thought of what had happened between her and her husband. It had always bothered her, but she also knew that Dan had always been gentle and not abusive, which made the experience of not feeling good a part of their life. The thought of what she was about to do, would be so different from what she had done with her own hands. What she was about to do, she was not sure of. But it was important she did, since there was no guarantee that she would survive it.</p> <p>As the wine had continued to flow, Jen's inhibitions returned, and she began making suggestions to Dan to allow them to come together or to go on their own. She told him what she had in mind, and he didn't argue. Before the end of the night, Jen's eyes widened as she imagined both of them coming together. The first time she had brought out the image of Dan's hard cock, and the first time, it was something else. She looked at her husband with tears in her eyes when he didn't respond, even if he wanted to.</p> <p>They were sitting in the kitchen of their small kitchen, with Dan and Jen at each end. Jen had a glass of wine in front of her; she had a glass of wine in the other. Dan finished off the wine and he held both glasses out toward Jen in a toast toast. As he did, Jen sipped from her glass, watching her husband's reaction. Just as she finished the toast, Jen looked at her husband with a quizzical expression, and saw a look almost childlike. For a moment she forgot that he was there. A sudden sadness suddenly swept over her, as her mind wandered to the night they had agreed to.</p> <p>As Jen finished the toast, she realized that they were talking without each other. They had talked about everything, except this time that the mood of the conversation seemed more serious. There was a sadness in her eyes that she could barely recognize, but there always seemed to be this connection between them.</p> <p>Jen got up to join them, and they all got a good look at her as she got out of the chair.</p> <p>"You two look good together," she said. "I'm sure my husband appreciates the compliments."</p> <p>Jen went to sit next to her husband, but Dan came up to her and placed his hand gently on her thigh. Jen turned toward him, and kissed him briefly on the lips.</p> <p>"I think we all like that," Dan said, with a smile that was so big, it almost fell off his face.</p> <p>"I agree," Jen reassured him. "He does say we both look good together."</p> <p>Jen and Dan kissed just that long, and then said, in unison, "Goodnight."</p> <p>That night, Jen and Dan had a very satisfactory sexual encounter. It seemed all of a sudden that the moment in their marriage had arrived. They were so comfortable with each other, and so comfortable doing all she liked from him. Even though, while they had enjoyed their experience, they never once mentioned it again. The more they spoke with each other, as they grew intimate in their sex together, the more relaxed they would become.
