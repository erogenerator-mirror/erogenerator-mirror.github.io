I asked. "You'll come to my apartment, you can put this in real money, and you won't leave the shelter." My heart was pounding from his words. I knew he meant what he just said. For the night. The next few weeks together, I'd be safe and secure. I wanted it to happen. I wanted to make it happen. He couldn't say no.</p> <p>"You mean this," he said.</p> <p>"You have my word," I said. I handed him the bundle of money.</p> <p>I walked out into the alley. He grabbed me and drug me to the elevator on my own. When it arrived I sat down in the waiting room while the manager walked me to the door. He took me into an office, and closed the door before he got even with me.</p> <p>"You are in danger," he started. He took a pocket of his suit jacket, unbuttoned and unzipped his uniform pants. I looked up, and saw him looking at the cock that had just been inside my ass. I gasped for the first time in weeks. It was bigger than mine. He started moving his hips, pushing himself into me as the elevator doors opened. He continued pushing himself inside me until the doors closed, then he withdrew from me. It was a long goodbye before the door slammed shut with a thud.</p> <p>****</p> <p>I couldn't concentrate. I couldn't focus on where the night had gone. For some reason a tear streaked down my face. I was so confused. When did I start crying. Then there was the first real time he ever touched me with a strap-on cock. He wasn't rough. He wasn't mean. He was gentle. I thought we were going to have sex on our honeymoon. But then I saw him pull the condom off his cock and roll it onto his shaft. That was it; he had to be finished. I could tell he didn't want to come. I don't know why the next few weeks were so fucking hard. But I knew he was going to give in. He grabbed my face and began to kiss it like a horny puppy. He forced his tongue into my mouth as his fingers started to rub my clit. He shoved two of my thick fingers inside me and started to pump his fingers. I felt like I was about to cum when he pulled out his fingers. I heard him spit into his hand, and then lapped it up clean as best I could.</p> <p>He moved to my side against the back of the couch. He leaned against me as I looked behind me. It felt as if our world had collapsed in on itself. He started to run his fingers through my hair. Then he took me in his arms and laid my face on his chest. I felt like I was about to faint.</p> <p>"You're amazing," he whispered against my neck.</p> <p>I turned my face towards his cheek. "You make love to me so good."</p> <p>He laughed at the silly little girls talk that we would sometimes do when we had our first date. He hugged me tightly as our lips once more met. After the kiss his fingers began to trace my clit again. He brought me closer to the edge. I was almost there but was feeling his own orgasm approaching.</p> <p>"No," I screamed. He smiled at me.</p> <p>"No, dammit! You're in danger! I need to feel this!"</p> <p>I looked up at him questioningly.</p> <p>He kissed me hard, taking my virginity. I was shaking. I tried to pull away from him, but he held onto my upper arms. He didn't push me. He just slid his fingers back inside me. He pulled on my nipples, rubbing them against the couch. My clit felt as if it was going to burst. I had to grab his arms and pull him away from me if I was gonna come. He leaned me forward more against the couch and I felt his legs push my feet further apart.</p> <p>"Please," I begged. I closed my eyes when he grabbed his cock and began to move it back and forth. I tried to reach for him but he held my arms firmly and pressed his pelvis hard against my clit as he fucked me. The pain/pleasure sensations shot through me. I felt an intense feeling all over. It was like I was alive but for a part of him.</p> <p>He pushed in harder and harder as my whole body started convulsing uncontrollably. I tried to grab him, or something of his body, but he was holding onto me the whole time. The pleasure was beyond what I had thought possible to endure. For a second I felt as if I were going to black out until once again my body froze. I closed my eyes and shivered again. But this time I felt as if I was coming out of my body a thousand different waysâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
