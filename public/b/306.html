I never really got to see you when they do. I’m really glad you got the job. I’ll come around in a few months. It’s just that we really need to be real careful, so we have to have a bit of privacy right there.” She got up and moved around in the kitchen. She started to pour herself a glass filled with something I had never experienced before.</p> <p>“That’s better.” she said, and I could tell now that she thought she was going to have this done in the next room. I could see it in her eyes. She was really going through with it.</p> <p>When Jennifer stepped into the kitchen, she put her glass down and turned to face me. She had on a white terrycloth robe that was folded on her. She put her hand on my shoulder and helped me step up into the hall, and lead me into the kitchen by the hand. She put a piece of paper over her glasses in front of me and I could read it. “Here’s a nice little tip for you, dear. Take this.” She handed me a half dozen dollars. “Don’t make it a lot.”</p> <p>I handed it over in return, but my eyes were already looking at her. She smiled at my reaction and reached for her purse in the cupboard. I watched intently, as she pulled out a very short skirt that was just a bit over the knee. It had a small white lace and satin halter top that she used to tie on a halter. She wore the dress over her shoulder. She had put on matching white stockings and high heels. I was in the process of putting more money in my wallet and she handed me the note.</p> <p>“Thank you, you are so kind. I hope we will have lots to do when you get back.” I looked at her and smiled. It was the first time in a while that she had taken me by surprise. She was doing a number on me as well. I guess I really did fall in love with her, and it wasn’t just that I had a thing for her. I had some suspicions that I would not be able to be faithful again. I also knew that there was no way I could ever fall in love again if I tried.</p> <p>Jennifer got a coffee can opened and started to pour it into the water. She looked over at me as I finished my tea. “I am so sorry to be such a little old man.”</p> <p>“And I can see you think you look tired.” Then I got to the real reason. “Do you think it would be OK if I borrowed you?”</p> <p>“I don’t know.”</p> <p>“How about you, maybe you better call my mom and let her know where you are. It will give us some time to ourselves.” With that she kissed me on the cheek and headed for the door. “Bye,” she said as she turned and walked away. I took a drink of my coffee and followed her out, as she walked across her garage in her heels.</p> <p>I turned the corner and saw her car already started. I reached up to turn on the ignition so Jennifer wouldn’t take us for a ride to the mall.</p> <p>“It’s ok,” I said, as she turned the key.</p> <p>“No, its not. My dad has something or another that keeps us from going all the way without knowing where we are going.” She was still turned to me, smiling at me when she said it.</p> <p>“It is all right, Jenny, really. It doesn’t make any difference. It is just the fact that we are going to be a family.” That statement seemed to be what she needed, as she smiled at me. “It is nice to have someone to talk to who knows a little.”</p> <p>She had come to know better now that she was older, and had learned much more about me and why I did things for her. A part of the excitement was watching this old man with a young woman who was so young. It turned out that my mother was a real slut. Her mother had just become old enough to be his daughter, and was married to a real hunk to the pastor. They had been trying to get them all to go away for years. It just seemed to take them a long time to get over it all together.</p> <p>Jennifer sat beside me on my lap as we drove down toward the mall. “Now I am a—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
