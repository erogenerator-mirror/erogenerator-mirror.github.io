I had not expected the urgency of our relationship, it had been far less than I expected. He was a man of character and his body felt so good against mine. He seemed so at ease and was as if he had been through a rough start. As I kissed him I wanted to show him how much he meant to me, and it felt natural. We embraced and I felt his naked body against mine. He put his arms round me and hugged my waist, it was strange, somehow my husband's body was more powerful, stronger than I had expected. I don't know if he was being dominated in this way or whether we were being "forced" into it but it made me more aroused than I had been in a long time.</p> <p>His arms slid down and around and around to my waist, my stomach and legs felt as if they had been moulded around him like a snake ready to be fed but then I felt him kissing me, I felt the first kiss as if our lips were kissing, his hands moved to my bum and a long slow slow kiss ensued with a lot of tongue. His strong arms lifted me onto the bed, my legs fell apart and he made to lower himself slightly, his tongue moved inside my wet vagina. It felt different too, different but wonderful! No other feeling like it was ever better or stronger, just different. We moved together and he lay down with his right arm under my head and his left hand under my armpit. I moved my head and kissed him more and he seemed to move his lips from my mouth and up to my neck.</p> <p>His tongue moved towards my mouth and I opened it and it slid inside, he kissed me long. I did not care that it was now our first time and could not be rushed into anything. I wanted us to be happy, to make one last attempt to be as special as we had been. I was not prepared for his mouth moved on to my ear and as his hot mouth moved to my neck I knew I would not last much longer.</p> <p>"Let's do it, I am going to want you to do it, not you."</p> <p>He smiled, he must have liked my answer. I did not let him pull back from my neck and he moved around me but my hands reached out to keep his body in contact with mine. I knew this was a test of whether I could really control him and make him do what I wanted. I moved my head around as if searching for his lips again with mine, I did not need him to kiss me, I was now with my husband and the moment his tongue moved into my mouth I knew I was now his, and there would be no going back. I was his, and I could do anything to please him. I wanted his tongue deep in my mouth and I did feel as if I were in love with him too. A year of separation and sexual deprivation is the best thing one can have for yourself, the thought of being without the love of your life, you were in love with someone you had never known, someone who you were never going to see again, was the best thing we could do for a long time together</p> <p>With his hand I felt him moving behind me and I knew I must feel his body against mine. I put my head back and I reached for him, now knowing what he wanted me to do. A feeling of anticipation made me feel so naughty and I liked how far he wanted me and I was ready to please him. We were both on the edge of the bed and I moved over him and I put my hands underneath him. I raised my bum and I could feel that my pussy lips were still open and the wetness of my lips was visible between them. He wanted me, he wanted my body, he wanted me inside me. I moved my body onto him, feeling him at the same time I felt the heat and heat surrounding me. Then I felt him, he felt inside me, he moved it in and he moved it out and I felt his cock in me.</p> <p>My mind was now a haze but my body was more alive. My muscles were all tingly all over my body and my clit was swollen and hard from the tension caused by the desire we had both felt. He had his arms going around my waist and mine were above his and we moved as one, each in our own way, like two sexual puppets. With each movement there was a different feeling and it was more intense than the last as I felt the heat of his body against mine and his cock moving inside me.</p> <p>I was still in control and I knew it, my mind was gone and I did what I wanted!</p> <p>I moved my hand to his head and put my lips to his as I began to use them, to show himâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
