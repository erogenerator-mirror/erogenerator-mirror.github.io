"I hope she's not a tease" he smirked.</p> <p>Lisa looked down but he quickly covered her eyes with his hands and kissed her forehead.</p> <p>Lisa looked around the room as if searching for a familiar face. She wasn't expecting to see a familiar face as soon as she saw a familiar person. But now she was on the cusp of being someone she had just met, someone she had always felt like she had a crush on.</p> <p>Lisa quickly looked around the room for her friend. She spotted the couch on which she and Scott had been sitting earlier, and was a little shocked to find it out about the time of the party.</p> <p>As she turned to sit down she saw the two men of her life being held captive under the gaze of a beautiful brunette.</p> <p>"Oh my god! Are you really here?" she questioned.</p> <p>"Well I suppose that answers it," Scott laughed.</p> <p>Lisa noticed that his arms were still around her and he squeezed her so tightly it felt like he might just crush her.</p> <p>"Please... I'm so sorry" she replied as she lifted one of his hands off of her body, trying to cover it with her arms.</p> <p>"Lisa, I've been waiting for you to come. It's good to see you, but just a little later. I have to get home and get things ready. You're staying here with your friends while I'm away."</p> <p>She stared blankly up at him, looking for the words that would change the mood they would be in. She was so surprised that he would be so willing to spend the night away from everyone, and she had to find out just what kind of person he really was.</p> <p>"Scott....." she said looking up at him nervously. "Are you alright?"</p> <p>"Lisa, I'm not sure what you want to say. You've got to say something." he said.</p> <p>"What is it?" she asked.</p> <p>"I'm sorry I said anything. Please don't be upset if you feel bad for what I did. I just came to tell you that I've been waiting for you for a long time. I wanted you so badly. I wanted you forever."</p> <p>He took her hand in his and pressed it against his stomach. She couldn't tell if he was upset or surprised and wasn't sure what to do, so she held her hand against him and felt him relax his body heat in response.</p> <p>"This makes me very happy to hear you say that" he said still looking at her.</p> <p>"Scott, your hand on my breast feels wonderful when you touch it. I haven't felt any sex in years. But I need more.... it feels so good"</p> <p>"Oh... Lisa, don't say anything. Please?" he pleaded.</p> <p>Lisa nodded her head but couldn't bring herself to respond. She was confused again as a part of her was afraid there would be some damage to the friendship they were developing right now.</p> <p>"Just give a little more, Lisa" he said while he ran his fingers through her hair and let it slide over her shoulder.</p> <p>"What if I asked you the same thing about sex?" he asked. "You'd have come home with me and said I wasn't enough"</p> <p>"It's not that simple" she said as she turned over and put her leg over his.</p> <p>"You don't know it yet, but something has to be done. It's not so fast" he said as his hand brushed the front of Lisa's pants.</p> <p>Before he could say anything she rolled her eyes and threw her head to the side in a mock tantrum.</p> <p>"Is there ANYTHING?" she yelled. "That's what I'm trying to do, so that you'd know I'm not like this."</p> <p>"Yes, I know, but some things just have to be done" he said, holding his breath as he felt himself getting aroused.</p> <p>"Are you sure about this? If I do this I mean it, don't you see...." she looked around the room as if trying to pick a direction.</p> <p>"Lisa, I'm sorry if I'm wrong, but sometimes you don't want to have fun. It's my nature. You don't have to do this."</p> <p>"I'll say this again- if it really bothers you please let me know" he said as he pulled his hand away from her hip and gave her a reassuring smile.</p> <p>"Now you know me, Scott" she said as she pulled his face down for another tender kiss.</p> <p>She had never had a good night kiss before, not even that of her ex-boyfriend. It was so newâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
