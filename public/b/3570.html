I said with excitement and impatience. "I'm not your babysitter, you mustn't do this and you shouldn't go! It's rude, you're doing something illegal!"</p> <p>I looked around for all kinds of people to stop at any time, but all I found was that several people were busy watching the show. Some people were even openly staring at each other.</p> <p>"If you want me to run you, we can talk later" I said, hoping to win the bet again. It was clear that she really would like to talk but I was determined to be a little more difficult this time.</p> <p>"I have to go." she said. "I'm sorry!"</p> <p>"No you don't," I replied. "You just let me make you feel uncomfortable."</p> <p>"Oh please!" she moaned. "It's true, but it's my first time, its been awhile."</p> <p>"OK."</p> <p>"OK. I'm going to go now," she said and turned to leave.</p> <p>My eyes were glued to her every move. I was so enthralled by the whole experience that my face was a bit flushed. My eyes were a bit damp too. I looked up at the sky and realized that I was getting really aroused by the show.</p> <p>"Oh yeah!" I sighed. "That's hot! I hope you enjoyed."</p> <p>As I was saying those words I thought of the other girl, and I looked around for other possibilities for our sex play to continue.</p> <p>"That was so hot!" I thought, "I hope it won't mean anything to you."</p> <p>Finally, I pulled myself together enough to say that I had a job well in hand and left the office. Fortunately, the place was empty save for the girls, who were all engrossed in conversation by the time I left. I decided to take the long way.</p> <p></p> <p>To Be Continuedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
