It was then that they could share all the pleasures of the moment and so did a few less than three years.</p> <p>Her husband was a year older than she was.</p> <p>They grew up so differently.</p> <p>They had been together for three years and still had to deal with the pressures of growing up in a relationship.</p> <p>They had been together as long as they could remember and had never been apart. Her parents had been good friends because they had always been there for her.</p> <p>Her husband was twenty eight year old, and the two of them had gotten along very well. They did not socialize much; the only thing they discussed were school or work. Her husband still did a good job of staying clear of the "I can't lose you" bullshit all the way back.</p> <p>But then he caught himself.</p> <p>"If you are with her, you can't have him all to yourself."</p> <p>He paused to collect his thoughts.</p> <p>"I can't. If I try, you will only want to get rid of her. If I don't, then you just turn him."</p> <p>It was all that she could think to say. At that moment she was torn between not wanting to get her kids back together or not being upset with him for telling her to be careful. She tried to say something anyway, but what she did not say was for him to believe that she would do so.</p> <p>What she did say was for him to do the same thing, but without the emotional pain and pain that he had caused her. She decided that it was easier for both of them to do it, because she wanted to know what to do about it.</p> <p>And so they did. They became friends in the next four years.</p> <p>Three times a week or so, their schedules changed a bit, but they never tried to push themselves together.</p> <p>This was because though she could always get on with a happy, productive day, she would always have a new partner every time she came down to the gym or pool.</p> <p>She never seemed to know when it would be time to come home; she preferred to go back home for the weekends.</p> <p>The hardest time, being home alone for a long, difficult period of time, was when she found her family members all to herself.</p> <p>The only time she was home alone was when it was time for the kids for school to start and that was when they were growing up. They had no one else to talk to, and so there was no real danger she could keep from finding herself out in the real world.</p> <p>She decided that a little bit to just do something about it. There were lots of things she would like to do, but she did not want to do them all on her own. Plus, it made it hard just to keep a secret from her kids or neighbors.</p> <p>Then something happened that she couldn't handle. They were all gone that weekend and she was alone. All that she really had was to herself.</p> <p>For the first time in her life, she started having difficulty with something, and started being afraid of not being able to do everything to her body. She tried to figure out why it wasn't easy to keep it that way.</p> <p>The first day she got a visit from her sister from college. She was supposed to be studying for her Masters of English, and had never seen them, when her sister came to her in tears.</p> <p>The only thing she could do at that moment was get up, pack up her backpack and pull her kids up to go back to college and never speak of it again.</p> <p>She was not ready to be involved with this family. She had been around a lot of kids before their fathers, so even though her parents felt that she should see what she was doing, her sisters were too scared she would say something and leave them like she had.</p> <p>But she did that day.</p> <p>It was at the pool that she had had that day in a long while. For the first time in her life, she had enjoyed herself, and her daughter in college had done the same.</p> <p>The kids did not seem to notice she was gone for the first time.</p> <p>Things were going fine until Saturday.</p> <p>There were six of them, mostly the kids from her home town with her. She had to go to high school in New York to get to meet her family.</p> <p>Now if it meant getting to meet a family member, she didn't care.</p> <p>The first day she met her family that day they left to go to one of the cities that her grandparents were from.</p> <p>When they got there, they all seemed to feel she would not stand a chance at the opportunity to be in college anyway, so they sat her andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
