I'll always love you for who you are and the love you mean to bring to me.'</p> <p>He didn't say a word, but looked away slightly, waiting for me to explain myself.</p> <p>'I love you, too,' I said. The words were true, but hearing them still hurt. I was torn between the love we had for each other and the love of feeling that he was coming home to me again. I had to find my father in me, and the pain I was feeling was going to fade. He told me I wouldn't be hurt, and promised that if he went for me he and I would be together forever.</p> <p>My mind started to wander again. My mother had died and he wouldn't be able to love me for who I was. What would he do? I couldn't get this in my head. I wanted him forever, but I couldn't understand what I wanted. My mother was a good person, and he wasn't. The love I had for him had become something else, something that was beyond what I had ever known. How could it not be love?</p> <p>'What's in it?' I choked out, almost too late.</p> <p>'Daddy loves you,' I said suddenly. 'I want him and I'll always love you.'</p> <p>'I'm sorry,' he said sadly.</p> <p>'I don't care,' I said with a sigh. She would probably kill me, I thought with a laugh.</p> <p>'Daddy loves you,' mom said, sounding different to me. A lot clearer. She had never expressed any affection toward me, let alone said anything about me. But then that didn't prevent her from calling me on the couch that I had shared with her when I was alone. That was one of the things that I hadn't wanted to acknowledge in any form.</p> <p>'Daddy loves you,' I said.</p> <p>'Dee,' she said. She sounded tired, and angry.</p> <p>'Don't give Mom what she needs,' I told her gently. 'She has something she needs to know about first. She's a lot like you are. She's a real help to us, really. I'm sure that she will enjoy it so much more with us,' I added. 'Now listen, if you don't want to do this, just say so. I will understand,' I told her.</p> <p>'You know how I would like to be?' she replied.</p> <p>'You know I would be up there on my toes. On my hands and knees,' I added.</p> <p>'Do you want them to see you naked?' she asked me. I nodded.</p> <p>'Show me' I said, but added, 'and see everything, okay?'</p> <p>She didn't hesitate. That was it. I thought she probably wouldn't be upset with something like that, and I was right. I put my panties on, and pulled my skirt down so they wouldn't be seen. Then, holding the shirt close to my chest, I pulled it up over my breasts to where my bra hung off me, then took the front of my panties and pulled it down to leave only the top part of my pubic hair on display. The shirt didn't cover much more than that, and it was my own body that was completely naked in the mirror. If what Mom said was true, she had an unbelievably attractive body. I wondered if perhaps I had turned her on, or just been too much to get my own kicks out of. Either way, I didn't care. I had nothing to hide anyway. I just liked to see and hear about them.</p> <p>'Touch yourself,' I told her, and she quickly did. I couldn't stop staring at my fingers caressing my breasts and running through my wetness. 'Is it okay, daddy?' she asked.</p> <p>'You bet it is,' I sighed, looking at her in the mirror as she touched herself.</p> <p>Then we came into each other's arms and I saw something I had not imagined existed before. A deep, unspoken understanding between us. Our love had grown, and it seemed destined for greatness. We were forever together. This was love, and it was meant to be. And it was something both of us were destined to hold as we were meant to be. It was something that could only be fulfilled once.</p> <p>***</p> <p></p> <p>'Now, do we have it,' said Michael. He held his hands out in front of him and looked hard at my eyes in the mirror. 'That's a yes,' I said.</p> <p>'What? You're going to ask mom to get naked with us? We'll do it every day,' he said.</p> <p>'If she doesn't, and if she's not really sure, then yeah, we'll play it. Besides, she told me last week that mom and herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
