She was making me upset. How dare she insult me like that? I could feel my face beginning to flush in embarrassment as I realized that she must be as well. I quickly pulled my jacket off and put it on over my suit to hide any evidence of my arousal. No one could see my bonking my wife anymore, could they?</p> <p>I glanced over at the women sitting around the table. They were staring straight at me. I really didn't know how to react to this. They obviously knew what was going on but were looking at me while they talked.</p> <p>My wife leaned over the table and started licking up my penis as I was staring in my direction. "What's going on here?" she asked, looking me over from head to toe.</p> <p>The women looked over to each other as they continued to talk, I had no idea what to say to her. I looked around the dinner table, trying to make myself as comfortable as possible as I looked over at her. I decided that at this point she will tell me what is going on with the other women in the room and I won't need to speak up.</p> <p>"Why don't you sit over there on this chair while we talk," I suggested. "You really want to talk about this, don't you? It's just a little uncomfortable."</p> <p>One of the women, a woman with a very short haircut, looked at me again, then at the others. The look was obvious. She slowly walked over to the chair to sit down, which meant that her skirt rode up her thighs giving me a perfect view of her legs. I took my hand out from under my desk and walked to the other chair, where I sat down on the chair and began to watch the rest of the women.</p> <p>She looked at me, then around the table. "I don't really know where to start, so it's best for me to start with the obvious. We all like to get off and this is no exception. So, here's what this is all about. If you really hate it, don't worry about it, this is completely under my control."</p> <p>"What do you mean by control?" I asked.</p> <p>"This is what you're here for." She leaned over and kissed me on the cheek. "And, if you really hate it, then all you've gotta do is keep your mouth shut."</p> <p>This was not new to me either, it seemed natural to me that she would get in the habit of making these women feel sexy in a matter of seconds. I got the feeling that she was using this to manipulate me. Or did she use a combination of some subtle seduction technique and a certain need to be in control. I could not read her mind very well though. I saw her as she continued to stare at the other women around the table.</p> <p>I began to wonder if she was also aware that she was doing so without her consent. I thought of this woman sitting at the table now, trying to pretend that she did not know what she was doing, but she was a woman who was in control. She may not be trying to control me at all, but she is a woman in charge. I decided to be a bit more forceful with her. I looked into her eyes and noticed that she was staring at my erection. I reached up and wrapped my fingers around the base of my shaft while the other ladies began to move around the restaurant making small talk.</p> <p>I sat there, trying to think of how to continue to control this situation. This was a woman who clearly loved my wife, a woman who needed to assert herself in this role. She was not a woman that would be intimidated by my penis, or by my power. I wanted her to feel comfortable being in control. Maybe, if she would let me control what happened next, then she would not be in so much danger of letting me down by letting me control her now. This just made sense. There is a point to having control over a situation like this, as in how we would handle the upcoming events.</p> <p>I glanced over to the others on the other table who were having their own tryst. Their eyes were riveted to my erection. All I could think about was fucking this girl. Now, the realization of what this is all about hit me. All the women around the table must be in pretty good shape and I was hoping that my wife would not be too upset. At that point I just wanted to get this out of my system, to forget about my own situation. I felt a wave of pleasure come on over me, and as that wave passed up my body I realized that my wife was right. As powerful this realization was, I was hoping that I could control things in a way that would not hurt her in the long run. My cock was now harder than my brain can ever beâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
