My right hand was rubbing my pussy while I pumped my fingers gently but powerfully up and down. I could hear his fingers flying over his body and felt his body writhe against mine. I felt his nipple tighten in anticipation as I pressed my fingers deeper into me. I felt the muscles of his tummy tense as he neared his climax, and he thrust harder against mine. I felt the heat begin to burn into my pussy, and I let out an elongated moan as I came. My legs shook and my body twitched. I felt the tingles in my pussy run up my spine, and I squeezed him tighter with my fingers.</p> <p>He began to relax against me. He was a heavy sleeper, but I enjoyed the experience as much as he did. I looked over at him and grinned. I could feel his arm moving against my breast, and I let him. I looked away then, so quickly that if anyone looked in our direction, they would have trouble not looking at us.</p> <p>I moved a little forward so he could move over so he could slide back onto the sofa. I slid forward, and he sat in front of me. I looked up into his eyes. He was watching me; he licked his lips and smiled.</p> <p>I smiled back and spread my legs. He moved closer to me, and I wrapped my arms around his neck. His body was against mine. I felt his hand slip down to my thigh, and he began stroking it gently. I let out a long moan. I moved my hand to his, and began stroking him again. His hand was moving, but his face was buried under my chin. We kissed, his tongue licking my lips and probing. He began to move his hips against mine; his cock twitched against my leg. I let out a sharp intake of breath and looked him in the eyes.</p> <p>His eyes met mine, and the fire in them got even brighter. We grinned at one another. Then he pulled back quickly and looked at me.</p> <p>"I still have the condoms in my pocket, and I still want to see you fuck each other."</p> <p>I smiled and reached out to my handbag. He sat up as I fished out the condom, the thin white one.</p> <p>"Don't just look at me, Ben, look at your cum."</p> <p>I kissed him and let him roll the condom onto his cock. I pushed him back down on the sofa, and straddled him.</p> <p>"C'mon, get ready." I whispered. "I will be quick."</p> <p>"I want you to cum with me." I teased. He grinned at me, eyes bright. Then he lowered his head and began licking my clit. He gently tongued my clit and worked up to my hole, and he began pushing his tongue inside. My muscles tightened on him, and I slid slowly down onto his tongue. I shuddered as he pulled on my nipples and sucked my pussy juices off.</p> <p>I ground my pussy against his tongue and fingers, feeling him thrust into me with more urgency. I let out a long moan as he reached to finger me. I had never ever had such a powerful orgasm, and I felt him thrust harder into me.</p> <p>"I'm close." He whispered after a minute. I smiled back.</p> <p>"I'm going to cum with you." I moaned as I came for him. He let me finish, then slid his tongue back inside of me.</p> <p>"That was a big one!" He said.</p> <p>"I hope my pussy still feels good. How would you feel about doing it just a bit longer?" I teased.</p> <p>"I don't know." He replied.</p> <p>"Well, it's been a really long day and I'm tired. Let me know if it's any fun." I smiled back.</p> <p>"Alright." He agreed.</p> <p>I took the condom off, put the condom on, and got on my knees in front of him. I put my hands on his thighs and leaned forward. I ran my tongue around his cock, enjoying the smell of it. Then I opened my mouth and slowly slid down. He was about seven inches long, just like I'd hoped, but was more than average for a man. I pulled up a bit and slid the condom off. I looked back up, and saw that he was close now, watching as my mouth slid on him several times. He was smiling, and I could see he'd enjoyed it.</p> <p>I sucked him a bit faster as I ran my hands over his body. I felt his cock twitch in my mouth and heard him say "You make me happy, you make me happy."</p> <p>I leaned back and looked up at him.
