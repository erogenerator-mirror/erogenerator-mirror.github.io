The sound of it, like someone trying to explain something. My wife took a small step backwards. "No" she said again, "No, never..." and pushed herself back toward the doorway. In one movement, she pushed past the desk, her hands in front of her and took the phone out of her handbag to put it in the bottom drawer of my desk at the top of the file cabinet. She pulled the phone from the bag, but just as it was about to hit the floor, there was a new sensation. "Ohhhhhhhhh, shit" I thought.</p> <p>Her hand, as usual, was shaking like I had just run a hand through my jaw. And I could feel the blood rush to my face. It made me feel warm, tingly, like I had just run a hand through warm, moist skin. I could feel the warmth of excitement flowing through me, almost as though the sun was just rising, aching to be set free again. I closed my eyes, knowing the rest of my body was already becoming aroused. I felt the tension rush through me as the feeling of the touch started building in my crotch. I felt my body shake and my hands reach up to clasp the fingers of my new lover's arms. I felt her body trembling as the tension flowed through her. "Ohhhhhhhhhhhh god it's been so long..." she whispered, her eyes still closed.</p> <p>"What?" I thought. "We have just been having a great day." The thought that I had just met my new, beautiful wife who was about to make me an exhibitionist was not going to be too strong. I continued to grip her arms, I could feel her trembling. I closed my eyes again, and just let her shake. My whole body was on fire. I didn't care how hard I was squeezing my wife's arms, I just wanted to squeeze them, to feel them, to see those lovely hands holding mine, and then let loose. I opened my eyes again just a fraction more.</p> <p>Karen's face was flushed with red colour, her eyes were wide as they stared into my eyes. She started trembling slightly.</p> <p>"I'm glad we were able to get away and talk. My nerves were on edge" I said, not saying any words. She shook again. I couldn't quite believe what I just said. I looked at my screen. "You're not going to do that?" she said almost in a whisper, her voice cracking. But her face was covered with embarrassment. She couldn't seem to think she should say anything, she could barely even speak, or even look at me.</p> <p>"I think you should" I said, not caring about it at all, but feeling my cock starting to throb under my trousers. She must have felt it, too. She moved the phone away from her handbag, and then stepped around the door to open it. I knew she was trembling as her hands fell down to her thighs and rested there on the desk.</p> <p>"Are you sure?" I asked again, my voice trembling a little, too. "I mean, my arms are trembling." It was clear from her shaking that she was unsure what I meant by that.</p> <p>"What's the matter?" I asked her, not wanting to let her get the whole thing out in the open. Even though I was not sure what I was feeling, I think I felt my wife was feeling herself. She just had the feeling that she wanted to be controlled. But at the same time she was also feeling a little like I was doing in the same way. I could always tell which ones went on the nerves of a woman.</p> <p>"It's nothing. Please..."</p> <p>"It's not. Please talk to me. Please tell me it's no big deal..." I was struggling not to make any noise but I knew she must have been wondering what she could say to me. I thought I detected a slight hesitation in her voice, as if she was unsure as to whether she should continue, if I should give her an explanation. I was just not sure if I wanted to hear it. "I'm just really sorry I said that, but you know I'm just a guy". She had stopped her trembling again but her hands were again on the desk, fingers trying to keep moving. I knew she wanted to just tell me that it was no big deal, to tell me that we were just having a little talk, but to take things further to where I needed to go.</p> <p>"No" I said, more slowly, and much to my surprise "but you said I had to know." Her eyes fluttered and she nodded slowly. I was still not sure whether I should get out of the office.</p> <p>"Now what? I don't really want to keep your mouth for too long" she said, now slowly speakingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
