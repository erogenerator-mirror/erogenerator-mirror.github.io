My curiosity got the better of me and I told her so, and that's all that I know until now.</p> <p>She went in to fix our dinner that night, leaving me alone and relaxed in an empty kitchen. When she came back and gave me a strange look, I just grinned and told her, "I am just teasing myself," and headed upstairs to my room.</p> <p>About fifteen minutes later she came downstairs followed by her dad with a pitcher of lemonade for me as an appetizer.</p> <p>"How is it that you and Mom seem to be doing the same thing as always?" I asked, wondering what her reaction would be.</p> <p>"We are just as much alike as before," she said, smiling. "I think that you will enjoy yourselves."</p> <p>"I am all too comfortable around him," I said, trying to keep my eyes on hers. "If my dad told me to do anything like that it is just with my head in his lap."</p> <p>She raised her face a little toward me for a second, as if she was wondering what I was thinking. Then she quickly added, "As soon as we have him back on his toes we need to get him up and down a couple of times, not just once a day and do more than once a time, just for the fun of it," looking away from my eyes. "I'm not exactly good at sex, but not lacking," she added with a chuckle.</p> <p></p> <p>We continued talking until dinner time. She told me that she couldn't quite concentrate on what I did because I was so excited and had a hard time keeping my hands off her.</p> <p>"I have to confess that we were in the kitchen trying to get the boys to do what you did the other day," she said with a smile. "You and I know that they probably like other people a lot and I don't blame them. I just want to know just what to do to make myself feel as good in bed as I have in your room."</p> <p>"I could teach them something," I suggested.</p> <p>"I don't want to do something as stupid as that. I want to take care of myself and let them do it. But, first I need to talk to you about it. I've asked you to do what you tell me to do but you've taken it back a step. If you are going to take this thing that you have with me and do it I need you to talk about it."</p> <p>"Let's be honest, you have a whole hell of a lot to tell me if you'd rather not," I admitted. I think I just had the upper hand by admitting that I was more interested in having sex with my wife of nearly twenty years than what I had to admit to her about not only sleeping around, but trying to get us past this whole affair.</p> <p>As we talked I kept looking down at her body again but she just sat staring at the wall. I'm not sure whether it was because I had a hard on, or maybe it was that I couldn't stop thinking about that hot bod of hers. I wasn't sure the answer was any of either, and I was a little afraid of going on like this again. "All right, I'll just have to take this with me and we can try it again later," I said.</p> <p>"Don't be an ass, Paul, you look like you might be having it off with someone. Why don't you stay tonight and have a nice time?" she said and headed for her room. She was about to call my dad, but as soon as she closed the door she turned toward me and said, "We are just friends aren't we?"</p> <p>"There's nothing wrong with the first date, is there?" I agreed. "Don't worry about it; we can make it up to us next time," I added, not sure where she would fit in.</p> <p>Since dinner was over, I settled down in my room to get ready to face her.</p> <p>"What did she make for dinner?" she asked a bit playfully as she was preparing to climb up on the scale. She pulled off her coat and began showing me how much she was wearing.</p> <p>"It's a Chinese special for the evening," I explained. "That'll have an energy boost when I am out of the bathroom."</p> <p>"You better get out of that too if you want to make time for sex tonight," she said with a grin. "I'm ready to try dinner again."</p> <p>"Okay," I said quickly. "What are you cooking for me?"</p> <p>"I was just going to run some Chineseâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
