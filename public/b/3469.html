Can I get you something to drink? We will catch the next truck. We will take it to the office. I need some food in me."</p> <p>"I'll get you some help. If you hurry, I know we can do it all the way back."</p> <p>That was the last time I talked to her. By the end of the weekend, I knew she was as mad at me as I was at her. When I saw her looking at me with something, it was an attitude of contempt like nothing that she had ever experienced. I felt sorry for her and wondered if she felt anything at all.</p> <p>Saturday, I got up early to get my food in bed. Then I sat up watching the last rays of sun that were starting to fall through the bedroom window. The light was brighter than the day when I'd last been in Hawaii. I had put on a white shirt that I had worn to the office for the rest of the day and I had packed my bag inside as well to put my stuff in the trunk.</p> <p>I got out of my truck, grabbed my cell and got out of the truck. As I stood in the dark in front of the house looking at my cell phone, my cell phone felt like it was right under my hand. I was sitting on my rear deck chair holding onto the phone to my chest as it was a little too close to my body to see out. Once again I wondered if I was trying to kill myself or even worse, I was dead to the world.</p> <p>I picked up the phone as I was trying to figure out how long it would take to get to my place. I was just about to hang up when I picked it up again. I turned the phone off.</p> <p>"Hello."</p> <p>A voice that I recognized as the neighbor.</p> <p>"Oh, sorry. I had to go away for a few days to visit my sister, and you were so nice. I thought I'd come see you."</p> <p>"Oh, it's okay. I know it's strange you called, I really didn't expect anybody to be on the other end of the telephone."</p> <p>I knew what had to be done. I walked upstairs and closed the blinds. I turned on a light that was on. I turned the light on and looked at my cell phone. I picked up the phone.</p> <p>"Hello?"</p> <p>"Hi, is this Steve? I'm going away on business this weekend."</p> <p>"Sure, of course. I'm not leaving here until Monday. Why don't you call me when you get here? I'll let you in."</p> <p>"Well, I was wondering if I could come over to your office. You didn't have to call. Is this important?"</p> <p>"It isn't important, Steve. I told you that you were going to have someone to stay in and to take care of you and look after. I'm not sending you to your room on weekends."</p> <p>I was beginning to get frightened again. Why couldn't this person not know that I was being held. I didn't know that this man knew who I was, so I hoped the information would not be known to anyone else. If this was a dream come true, then I hoped it wouldn't be very painful. Then again, if this man was an angel on a deserted island, I guess the idea couldn't be so terrible.</p> <p>"Oh, okay. I'll see you in a little bit. I'm not busy in my job."</p> <p>"Bye. Bye for now."</p> <p>My next customer was a few minutes later. When he answered the phone, I took a chance. I answered the phone. I could hear his voice on the other end of the line. "Hello. It's not Steve, is it? Come in the front door right away. I'm glad. I have something to do."</p> <p>"I'm not surprised you were having some difficulty getting past my office."</p> <p>He told me to come through the back door and wait for him there. I knew I could have made it through the door without making a sound. As it was, he walked in a few minutes later. He closed the door behind him and turned to face me. I stood there, watching him. He pulled his shirt off. He didn't have very hairy pectorals. My eyes started to get large at the thought of his muscles and the shape of his body. Then he put his hands on his hips and smiled at me.</p> <p>"Now, what would you like to do this weekend? Do you want to go to a beach or at home?"</p> <p>"Let's go swimming. I think we would have something nice to wear."</p> <p>"I have a nice bathing suit. You didn't bring any, so maybe this will come offâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
