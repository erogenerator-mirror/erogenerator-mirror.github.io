I can't wait for more!"</p> <p>"That was great, your first time."</p> <p>"I think you and Mom are going to have a lot to do to get that going."</p> <p>"Yeah, if you ever need anything at all then give us a call!" she said with a wink.</p> <p>"Oh, I'm about to go do some reading. I'm going to catch a late movie, I'll bring something along."</p> <p>"Oh, I'll be sure." she smiled and gave a knowing grin back.</p> <p>The next few days felt like they had become something of mutual excitement for both of us. Neither one of us noticed that there was more than one person in the house. It was only when Saturday rolled around that we both realized that there wasn't that much more than just one person working in the house, at least I hoped there were. The idea of more of our "business" was having a much more positive impact on our sexual relationship. For the rest of summer I was looking forward to the opportunity to be at work even more. For better or worse, it never seemed to get in the way of things. I think I was in love with Mom and was hoping that we had a long-term future together and that she would be able to be happy with me.</p> <p>As the days went by, both of us grew more and more comfortable with what was going on around us. I had never known mom so much loved me. It was the most wonderful time of my life even though it was a little more than the first. By late spring my whole life was looking at the possibilities and when it came down to it, I actually felt like Mom was right there and I really wanted it to happen.</p> <p>On the other hand, the thought that Mom was always up for something was getting to me a bit. I didn't want to seem anything except happy. Not to mention the fact that it always made my heart pound with desire. I knew that I would feel a great deal of anxiety if I was to actually see her when it came to seeing her in the nude every single day. I felt a little self-conscious about being so self-conscious about it. I felt a little afraid that I might take it a bit too far. But I also felt a little excited by my excitement. In fact, the closer I got to Mom the more it kind of felt like a sexual game. I never really understood why, but for whatever reasons, my heart didn't want to move on.</p> <p>The day before Christmas, my mom was down for her usual afternoon "business meeting" at a friend's house that she had. Mom usually had friends over, so our "business" weekend was about to be a special affair. She had just come down with the flu and her "buzz" was a bit loud and a lot of the staff felt she needed a break. She had just gotten her usual "honey bun" in the oven when I popped up. I gave my mom a hug and a kiss on her wonderful cheek.</p> <p>"I'm so glad you made it down."</p> <p>"Me too, Mark, I just needed someone to help get me to see it for myself."</p> <p>"Well I'm glad you did and that we could get some work done for a while." I added.</p> <p>"Well, it's my job to make sure we start on Christmas, but it's my day off. It's just us now. You guys can hang out if you'd like and don't think it's too weird, okay?"</p> <p>"I don't feel weird. I don't think you have to worry about our company being aware of you and I. I have to go but I wouldn't mind some alone time."</p> <p>"Okay well, I'm sure we can always come back some night." Mom replied.</p> <p>As I left for work that morning, I felt a little sad again about what had happened the previous night. But I didn't think much about it until later that day when I got to work. I just wanted to be able to see Mom whenever she was around. I went to bed early that night and decided that when she got home that day that it would be enough. Mom had spent most of the day talking with her mother and trying to get to some sort of a point where she could tell Mom about what was going on. For the next couple of days, I just sat around like a stone, thinking about how I'd felt at first being so vulnerable. After that weekend, I was really surprised that it wasn't feeling a little bit like the earlier sex we'd just had. It was just something about the intensity of it thatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
