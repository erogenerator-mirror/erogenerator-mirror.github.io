He took the stairs that lead upwards and found a table where no one could see him. He sat down, the hostess took a seat down the table and a group of people settled on either side of him. Her name stood out even in the dim light of the room. Her face flushed red as the heat of the others body warmed into her bones.</p> <p>They started talking for just about half-an-hour when one of the guys on one side of him said that he was the only person in the bar on the last shift. It was then that he remembered he had asked for a job at the next shift. He took a sip from his drink then, with some effort he managed to control his body from shaking violently.</p> <p>I looked as if I had to take a shit and started to rub my leg as I kept my eyes glued on her. I noticed her eyes glancing at my legs just the same way. We smiled at each other and she looked back at me.</p> <p>"So," she said. "I guess you did have a good show at work."</p> <p>Her eyes went to the guy next to her. I saw that the man's fingers were stroking the length of her leg. I had my hand in my pocket and felt that I wanted to touch myself if I could just get it off. That I was trying to catch my breath at one minute.</p> <p>She was looking at me with the same smile that I was wearing. Her eyes returned to mine as she kept going. The way she had leaned forward was getting her shirt a little tighter between her breasts. They swayed and jiggled.</p> <p>"Why not?" she asked, "What do those other guys think they've got to watch over before they can really enjoy the show."</p> <p>It was all I could do not to laugh. Then, after she had looked at me for a minute, "There's only one thing that I'd like to do right now."</p> <p>Her eyes went directly down to my lap where I was trying to keep it hidden under my dress. I saw that she was looking me in the eye. Her finger curled around the hem of my skirt. The look of my body and my heart gave her away.</p> <p>She smiled at me again. This time, with a slight tilt toward me, she raised her hand to her mouth and sucked on it. It was the kiss of a hungry animal, and I could imagine being sucked on right there too.</p> <p>Her finger slid from my mouth and came back to her lips. "Well, I'll take a chance that I don't know of. We need to do a lot of work, I guess. Maybe we can keep up to date with the numbers and catch up."</p> <p>I nodded. She looked into my face again. My lips tightened together again at thought of what she had in mind for me. I knew what the number should be. If it turned out to be just a little below her waist. A little farther. I did my very best to keep my eyes from looking at hers.</p> <p>In response, she leaned back slightly. It was now almost two inches from my face. It was just barely covering and looked as if it was barely enough to be a handful. Just enough to have a hint of cleavage but not so much as it would be the total amount of my body.</p> <p>I looked down again to where it was. Her skin was flushed and hot. The heat of her body had made my dress stick up under it. I realized that both of her hands had reached down and were gripping her thighs. It was one of the most exciting things that I had ever seen.</p> <p>"This isn't what you want?" she asked with a bit of a giggle. I saw the look of her eyes again and realized that she was now beginning to breathe heavily. This was probably the best one she's had all night long.</p> <p>"Um...if you want to..." I said, "but I don't think I could do this..." as I slowly rose in the seat. I was feeling pretty flushed myself. I was aching to lean forward and touch myself but I felt like it was time to save myself and stop this.</p> <p>"It's okay," she said, as if she couldn't believe that I actually wanted to do this. She had a little shiver in her chest. "I'll even show you what a good job you've done at the office." She raised her left hand until it rested on the table.</p> <p>Like that I'm sure. It did feel odd. I was already feeling the heat from my chest and thighs. But I didn't feel like I was going to stop or anything. I wanted this job. I wanted to do anything I could to get it. I wanted to get laidâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
