"But not right away. There's more, perhaps."</p> <p>"I know," I agreed. "After all I did for you."</p> <p>"As a matter of fact," the doctor smiled, "you did, too."</p> <p>"Right," I agreed once again.</p> <p>"Right," Dr. Pascaline responded. "But if I do say so, you two might not survive much more of this."</p> <p>"That depends," I said honestly.</p> <p>"Yes," the doctor agreed, "It depends. Or not." He paused for a second, and then continued, "Or, maybe, not."</p> <p>With that I felt my cheeks burn warm as blood flooded my nipples, creating hot puffs of air against my upper chest. My body, which had been aching from the endpoints of arousal all day, relaxed as it always had, with only the slightest sign of fatigue.</p> <p>"Would you like a glass or two of wine?" the doctor asked.</p> <p>"No!" I argued.</p> <p>"Don't," the doctor said, as he reached toward me, pulling me down on his lap.</p> <p>"But I do," the doctor continued, wrapping his arm around my shoulders.</p> <p>"I'm not your girlfriend," I cried out, "but I'll do just about anything you need!"</p> <p>"And then you will," the doctor said, "And, my dear, you will!"</p> <p>Dr. Pascaline looked thoughtful as he leaned back, pulling me down with him.</p> <p>"I suppose," he said, in a tone I'd never heard him use before, "that I could stay here and continue to make it up to you."</p> <p>"Oh, please," I said.</p> <p>I felt his left hand touch me with a gentle pressure, his hands gently kneading my flesh up and down, the skin of his fingertips gliding over the thin covering of my pubic hair. I felt the warmth of his body against my skin, his manhood, so soft and smooth against my hip.</p> <p>Dr. Pascaline continued to massage me, feeling my muscles, my skin, the tension in my core, my insides, and I relaxed even more. I surrendered to the sensation of his hand on me, for a moment at a time.</p> <p>"You're so smooth," he praised. "I'm always pleased to learn such detail. Such a beautiful girl."</p> <p>I closed my eyes, feeling the touch of his hands on me, and sighed as his fingers ran over my shoulders, caressing, teasing me. I felt heat rise up from the pit of my stomach, and I felt another wave of desire. My legs fell apart, pressing into his manliness, and I felt my nipples growing firmer in his touch.</p> <p>"Yes," I murmured. "I would love that very much!"</p> <p>"I'll bet you do, " he agreed as his fingers touched the moist tip of my cock. I felt it respond to his touch as his fingers stroked and fondled me, and I felt my cock stiffen even more in his gentle touch. The thought of getting aroused and feeling myself being stimulated turned me on even more, and I felt my body stiffen and I could feel the pre-cum of my pre-cum on the head of my cock.</p> <p>"Let's go upstairs," Dr. Pascaline whispered as he turned me around and escorted me up the stairs into his office.</p> <p>"I'll have you do something tomorrow," he said, "But not too much today!"</p> <p>"I just want to get my mind straight," I said as I sat down behind him. "This is important, Doctor!"</p> <p>My mouth watered as I remembered the feeling of his soft and warm hands on my hips, his fingers running up and down my side, and his cock pressing up against my ass. It had been so long since I had felt a man's touch like he did mine, and my body felt warm as it responded to his touch. The feeling of his fingers working over my hips and my ass was as exciting as the sight of his cock in my face!</p> <p>When he had been kissing my cheeks the night before, I had felt his mouth slide across them, and his tongue lashing my clit. But not the full, passionate oral sex I had received from the three women that evening. I had just experienced those feelings from one man, and the feeling of two tongues on my body together was a new addition, and my body felt as if I were a different girl.</p> <p>"You are a gorgeous woman," he said to me, as he wrapped his arms around meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
