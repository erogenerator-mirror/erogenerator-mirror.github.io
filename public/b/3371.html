"You look so handsome, Michael," she said. "Let me see something. You're making me nervous."</p> <p>"You're not, though," I told her. "The dress will help the view, though."</p> <p>"Oh please," she said, turning to take a closer look. "Michael, will you take off your jacket?"</p> <p>"Of course," I said, "but I'm going down to the beach. What are you watching?"</p> <p>"The swimmer on television," she said. "I'm watching the video, Michael. That's my sister in the video."</p> <p>There was something I didn't understand. I got up out of my chair and grabbed a large beach towel, but as I had never been out to the beach before I had to put it under my chair. I walked to the water, and after putting a towel over my body, I walked out into the heat. The water felt good, and it gave me a nice feeling. I sat on a bench, and then crossed my legs, leaning in toward her. The warmth of the beach was comforting, and I watched her as she sat on her towel and crossed and uncrossed her legs. I kept watching her, and even though the breeze hit my inner thighs, I couldn't help looking up. After a few seconds I could tell she was getting a little aroused, and that was fine. I leaned back in the tub and enjoyed the scenery.</p> <p>I couldn't wait until morning though. I sat in my bathroom a little after 10:00, soaking in the warm water. Looking around, I wondered how I was going to start my training this summer, which was going to be fun again after watching the video. If I didn't do things right, there would be no going back if I did. By the time Michael arrived home that evening, I had gotten myself into a pretty good routine. I hadn't gone out at all, but I had gotten into the gym several miles on Thursday, and had spent Monday and Tuesday working out. I was pretty flexible. By the time the end of the workout was over, I was in pretty good shape, which made me all the more attractive to a lot of people. I loved watching the video, and I made a point to do it all the time. I've done that with people, even in the last year, and I've been a pretty good actress, too.</p> <p>I spent that time getting ready for what was to come. I took two days off from working out to spend the time with the kids. Saturday morning, I took a bubble bath and went looking for a nice suit. When I saw the suits I wore, I was very pleased. They just weren't as comfortable, and I couldn't wait to get home. I didn't wear a bra to work, and didn't bother to pick a shirt for a bathing suit either, either: I just had to get rid of the old ones. By the look of them, they might just make a nice little bulge in my suit pants. My suit pants weren't exactly conservative, but I didn't care. So I just went ahead and wore the suit I wore when I was at home at some point.</p> <p>I thought about taking a shower first, but then decided against it. I wanted to feel pretty. By washing my hair and face, I decided that I'd take a little more time than going to the beach. I shaved my legs last night, and kept them trim and smooth, except for the little strip that I'm sure that any other woman would have shaved yesterday, but the fact that I shaved myself was a little different. I didn't want to show them off anymore than that, so I kept my legs as smooth and unblemished as possible.</p> <p>I finished the hair, and went to go to work. I was trying to get into the habit of trying to do my work while I worked. After a lot of hard work I needed to get out of my uniform, and so I took it off. As I walked out into the garage for the third time, I saw Michael's car there. I walked into the living room to greet him, and he gave me a quick kiss.</p> <p>"Hey," he said, "You look great."</p> <p>"You look beautiful yourself," I told him. I don't know what I think, though - I couldn't think of anything to wear, so I just said, "Hi. I thought it would be nice to get some clothes on, too."</p> <p>"No silly," he told me - "You look great."</p> <p>I went along with him into his room to change into an almost see-through nightgown, and then I went back into his room to change the bed.</p> <p>"It's not my fault youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
