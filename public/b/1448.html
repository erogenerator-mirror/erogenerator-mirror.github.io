I decided to give her some time to come home. If she thought she could make it back home today I would be sure.</p> <p>When she arrived home she was not as pissed off as she had expected. I sat her down and we had a passionate "talk" while Mike poured a cup of coffee for himself.</p> <p>Once the conversation had stopped for a while I told her how happy I was to have her home with me. Mike thought I wasn't even aware that I had a boyfriend. She never mentioned it.</p> <p>We sat on the sofa and sat quietly talking for a bit. Mike poured more coffee and we spoke of other things. When he finished I stood up and said to him "Would you be so kind as to get us a cup of water so we may talk?"</p> <p>When Mike got up and came back with a cup and some water we sat back down. Mike poured and I took a sip of coffee for myself. He asked her to take it to the counter to get another cup and then we had some more coffee.</p> <p>Mike started to point my questions and I knew what he was going to ask next. At first I didn't expect it. What should I ask? What should I do? I had an idea of what I wanted to suggest but I thought I should know. Then Mike asked me if I really liked him. I asked him if the feelings that his answer gave me were feelings I might have had if I was a man in his position.</p> <p>Mike said "You would think that he might be the answer."</p> <p>I could not believe it. I had been feeling the same thing myself ever since he said 'maybe it was because of our marriage or something like that.' This was wrong. I could never be happy with it if I didn't love Mikes and not have sex with him for him.</p> <p>Mike was silent. He didn't ask what made me think that he might have feelings for another woman. I asked him what the last piece of news had been. He laughed a little and said that he had never thought about it before. I had been so busy being with other men after the war that I had not noticed him and the way that he had looked at me.</p> <p>"He was looking at me too, I thought he must have been staring because he has no idea about what I am," I thought to myself and wondered if I had really done that to him; if he thought that he would get over it somehow. Maybe I didn't have to go through with it.</p> <p>I thought that Mike would understand that I had been looking at him. I just was not ready to have it explained to him about his 'new found love' and how he was treating me as a woman. I asked him why he had kept looking at me that way after I left the war.</p> <p>"You were all dressed up and sexy in that picture that you sent me with some of those letters when we were in the war," Mike laughed. "I didn't even know you were so beautiful. I just assumed that you would have been happy with what you saw. I thought as much – or maybe even more now that you told me."</p> <p>"Well, you know I love you like a baby sister, don't you?" I said seriously to him. At this point I wasn't sure if he knew that and he didn't seem to care if I thought he did. He seemed to understand.</p> <p>"I guess I do", he said then leaned back in our kitchen chair and looked at me in the eye. "Why don't you get yourself a cup of coffee and we'll talk things through. You could take the pictures with you and we can discuss them sometime, if it is that much of a risk," he said. I stood and went to the other room but he stopped me while I was going.</p> <p>"Let me make sure you are comfortable with the situation and then I'd like to take the pictures for you."</p> <p>I did not protest. I just leaned back in the chair. I took a sip of coffee and sat it in front of me. Mike took out the second photo and looked at it.</p> <p>I don't know how exactly it happened but it was the only time he had looked that closely at the picture of me when I was in the photo shoot. I just stood up and walked to him after we had calmed down. I kissed him and asked him to let me make love to it the way I wanted to. I felt as if he felt as much as I did.</p> <p>In—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
