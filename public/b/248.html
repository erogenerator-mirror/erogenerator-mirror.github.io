So quickly I was afraid he'd come, in this state!</p> <p>He slipped the tip of his manhood into her willing mouth.</p> <p>"Uuunnnhhhh!" she grunted around it.</p> <p>"I need to fuck a while longer, you little fuck!"</p> <p>"No! Not your tongue!" she said, moving away.</p> <p>He moved his face down to her pussy, pressing his lips against it and licking, tasting her and finally driving himself into her and making her moan around his manhood.</p> <p>"My god! Oh my god!" she said. I felt like I had no control at all.</p> <p>He was holding on for dear life to keep from shooting his entire load in her mouth, and the feel of her mouth on him was just too strong! I was shocked to hear herself talk like that. It must have been the alcohol that got to her when she agreed to this!</p> <p>"You're right. It's the alcohol that does it. That's the booze that makes you, oh God, make me a man! I want you to feel that too! I want to feel that inside me!"</p> <p>"You're beautiful!"</p> <p>'No, no! My husband's perfect, gorgeous and I don't want to leave you! I love you!"</p> <p>"I want to be a little, well, I've been a little. . ."</p> <p>"But you'll be back in the bedroom with him now, willn't you?"</p> <p>"Yes, God, yes, I will! You know I'm the only one with a lot of experience! . ."</p> <p>"Oh my god," she said again, and then, and suddenly, "And I think you're the one that needs some practice too," with a wicked grin.</p> <p>"I thought that was what I was into."</p> <p>He moved her up the bed. She was lying on it with her legs spread wide open and her head turned toward him.</p> <p>"Let me do that for you," he said, moving his face toward her pussy.</p> <p>"God! No!"</p> <p>He moved the tip of his tongue to her pussy and quickly found her clit.</p> <p>"Oh! Oh! Oh!" she yelled. "Yes! Oh! Yes!"</p> <p>It hit her in just the right place, and her pussy tightened around his tongue. She shook all over as her orgasm tore through her.</p> <p>"God! Yes!" she called out again.</p> <p>He lifted his tongue to the very small opening she had made, and slowly licked her from clit to asshole! She nearly had a seizure. Suddenly he removed his tongue and slid it into her asshole, and it was wetting back up toward his mouth! He began to move in and out!</p> <p>"Oh! Oh! Oh, God! Oh! Oh! Ohhhhh!" she began to yell again and screamed as her first orgasm hit her.</p> <p>"Wow! What a good start! Now! My turn!" he said.</p> <p>She rolled him onto his back and slid herself onto him, and he began fucking her again. After a short while, she stopped moving at all.</p> <p>"I'm sorry you had to be so scared, but I just want to have an honest conversation with you. I didn't mean for this to happen! It has been so much easier for me, I've had to learn a lot about sex, now, and it's so much more than you've been used to. I really should have, you know, but, you know!"</p> <p>She got off of him.</p> <p>"Let's get some food, and I'll get you all set for dinner," she said, pulling on her robe. He helped her up and the two of them dressed. He opened the door to the bedroom and she kissed him briefly on the cheek, then on the lips. He turned to follow.</p> <p>"Oh God. Why do I want to make out with you with every meal," she said, standing there for several moments, watching his eyes looking down at her ass and thighs as he walked by. "You know. . . ."</p> <p>"Huh?"</p> <p>"You can't be gay, no way. Not that way," she said.</p> <p>"Sure, I mean, I'm all for gay women. I know it wasn't your thing. But if you were, you can't be gay. Is that what you're saying?" he said.</p> <p>She took his hand, which had been holding the door wide open, and led him toward the kitchen. He followed and watched as she moved the cart to fill it, then turned back to him.</p> <p>"I mean, I wasn't gay, but you're notâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
