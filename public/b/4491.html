They say that they were doing it in the church."</p> <p>"Oh, my God." I sighed. "I didn't get the chance to talk to a minister and he's gone. I hope to hell I haven't ruined his reputation."</p> <p>The words, and the tone of their communication were not the most pleasant of encounters. But that is all they were, and they felt as if they could change anything that would change them, so I didn't dwell on that.</p> <p>"That's nice to know." I agreed.</p> <p>We drove on in silence for longer than necessary, until we reached the village's turn off. She turned to me, giving me another smile and then took her hand to pull me closer to her. I could not help myself and I kissed her lips lightly before putting my arms around her and pulling her body tight against mine.</p> <p>"It's good to be home, isn't it?"</p> <p>She was quiet for a moment as I kissed her neck. "It's good to be home."</p> <p>"The night life was all about you, too, Baby."</p> <p>"I'm still very much in a good mood, but I wish I was a little hornier that what we did in my office."</p> <p>"I think I can help. I always am. What is it you're going to ask me to do for our friendship?"</p> <p>She considered my response a moment before replying. "Well," she answered, "maybe we should sit in our church and listen to some of the words he came to me say and do."</p> <p>"How many times did he tell us how he thinks of you as God?"</p> <p>She nodded slowly. And then she looked at me, and grinned. "What do you think?"</p> <p>"We have no idea what kind of preacher he is, and what his meaning is for you."</p> <p>A light glistened in her dark eyes as she smiled, and she pulled me up into kisses. I felt that I was lost again to the world as I felt my mother slide further into me, and I felt my nipples tingle as her tongue touched them. She kissed my arms, my neck, my cheekbone, and then, once again, in the soft light of our living room when she was pulling my mouth to hers. I felt her arms around me before she pulled back, and my heart felt as if I was trying to tear free of its own walls.</p> <p>"I'm going to go get a beer again, and then you're going to watch some TV. When I get back, you can't resist kissing me, or letting your hands roam a little." She smiled at the last one and pulled me into a full on embrace as we kissed. Her lips felt incredible. I could feel every inch of her body against mine and I could feel my cock begin to harden.</p> <p>"And what do you want to do when we get home, Mom?" I asked.</p> <p>She had her head on my shoulder and her hand on my chest, looking over the top of my sweatshirt at me. "I want you so much, but I want you to ask me something."</p> <p>I was stunned by her revelation and she knew it as well as I did. "Of course, Baby." I was speechless. "That means that you'd say something that I couldn't do."</p> <p>We hugged for a while longer until the front doors opened and some of the townspeople got quiet. Mom looked over the tops of her sunglasses at me. "That was nice, sweetie, you did good. I know that all the town was getting a head of dust when he told you to go and kiss a minister. Don't worry, he's not going to hurt you, and he's not going to tell you why you've been such a good girl. I'll be back in a half an hour."</p> <p>The back door opened once more as the crowd moved into the front room in front of the church's doors. The young woman's face broke into a big grin when she saw me hugging my mother. She gave a little chuckle to herself as she walked to the door as the couple from the church came over to us. Then the man stood up and shook my mother's hand.</p> <p>"Hi, Baby, how's it going?"</p> <p>She grinned as he shook her hand, then returned to me to kiss me, all the time keeping her lips pressed to mine. She kept his lips on mine, but at the end he pulled back and looked over at me.</p> <p>"Well, your friend here gave me one hell of a kiss, Bro."</p> <p>"I'd say your friend did," I said, and she shook her head and laughed. "Sorry about that, Mom, and that's what makes it fun."</p> <p>She gave me a look of appreciationâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
