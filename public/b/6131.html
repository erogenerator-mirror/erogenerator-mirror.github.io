This evening was very special to me. She will love you very much."</p> <p>"She loves you with all her heart."</p> <p>"Oh she does. I feel much better about this."</p> <p>"I want you to be happy."</p> <p>We hugged, hugged, hugged. We kissed and I kissed her cheek and she kissed me back. Then she said that the only way to be sure that we wouldn't be apart was to be a part of her life.</p> <p>We kissed again then she turned us around and kissed the side of my face, then I kissed her lips, then her cheek and then down across her neck and down her back. As she did this I moved my hand down cupping her full breast and then she turned to meet me and our lips met. My lips parted but we didn't move at all. It was as if her lips were parting. My tongue was at her opening and entering. The tip of it was wet and warm against her tongue. Our tongues went into each other's mouths and then back to each other. I held her face, my hand was squeezing at her breast and her hand was pulling at my penis. We broke apart. Her body was tingling again as she pulled away slightly, then down into me, my lips met hers and our mouths opened then closed, we kissed just a bit for a few seconds. I broke off to look down and saw her looking back up into my eyes.</p> <p>"See?" I whispered.</p> <p>"What?" she whispered back in a hushed voice.</p> <p>I started to move in her again but she stopped me.</p> <p>"Take your time, love. We can do the rest on our own. I want you first."</p> <p>"I'd like that."</p> <p>After a short kiss on her eyelids, eyes and cheek, she moved forward and stood up. We held each other's nakedness. She led me down the hall and through her bedroom door. Opening the door she said "Come in, I have some soft music on. Come in."</p> <p>I had to be careful with my tongue as I started to walk into the room. She was in white and sat on the bed, leaning back on her elbows and looking at me. She took my head and looked down at me with a smile. She had pulled off her robe and stood topless in front of me, her body still tingling and glowing, and her legs as she had on the other day still tingled. She turned to me and slowly pulled the material of the robe off.</p> <p>"I am so going to make you very happy."</p> <p>"The sex you have with me will make my whole body feel so happy."</p> <p>"Oh yes, that will make me so happy also"</p> <p>She reached down, took my hand, and slowly stepped back from me. I was standing in front of her, so close to her that when we touched we kissed. We kissed deeply, our fingers entwined and our arms around each other. She felt so lovely and so desirable and I could not help myself. She was as lovely as I had imagined and as hot as I had imagined.</p> <p>"Darling, it has been so nice to be with a man and make love with a naked woman."</p> <p>"And it has been nice making love with you too."</p> <p>"I don't usually want to make love with anyone; not just with a woman, but with you."</p> <p>"I thought we'd make love later."</p> <p>I stood in front of her looking down into her pretty face, I took her hand again and looked at her.</p> <p>"You've already made it very nice."</p> <p>As she looked over my body, I moved her hand away from me.</p> <p>"Darling I won't get dressed this time, only you and I can take our time together. It's only fair that you go first."</p> <p>"I don't need to," she said slowly, "just take off your clothes. I want you."</p> <p>I took of my shirt and pants, and she quickly slipped off her robe. Her naked body and I naked stood before her holding the long length of my cock in my hand.</p> <p>"My body will do the rest" she whispered in a husky voice, "let me lie on my front."</p> <p>She moved her body over on the bed and got on it. She kissed my chest and licked the shaft, then I moved to a position under her. As I kissed her lips again the lips and then her breasts took my breath away. She turned to face me then, took my arms, and drew them up behind me. She wrapped her legs around me and pulled me in so that our chests were touched with our rising excitement, which was growing.</p> <p>"It has been so wonderful making love with youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
