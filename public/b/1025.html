The lights were good with the warm night air. The air was alive and filled with passion.</p> <p>We walked through the streets until we eventually came to the corner of the park. It was full of people - many of whom seemed to be the same age as us - a single girl, a boy sitting next to him, another young woman with whom he was talking, and one girl, also with her friend, staring at us.</p> <p>We stopped next to the old picnic tables. The young woman was talking to her friends. I asked if they were from work and they said they were. When I asked them about their jobs they all grinned and shrugged.</p> <p>"So what is it that you do?" The young girl asked them while they were talking. I looked around to see a couple that belonged to a good looking guy.</p> <p>I guess they had come from outside my area of work on that trip and, though he smiled, he looked nervous.</p> <p>"We work for the Department of Energy. We work with our companies." The young girl spoke up.</p> <p>"Is that really the Department?" I asked and he seemed to hesitate to answer. His eyes kept moving to me and I could tell he wanted to know more.</p> <p>"We're in an electric company, like us," he spoke up before he lost control and spoke of the two companies I worked for. "We get the power installed. It was an accident."</p> <p>"You work in the Energy department?" He replied.</p> <p>"No. We're in the Department of Government. It's the Government." He said without turning his head.</p> <p>"Why is it that you are telling us this? That we shouldn't be telling you anything?" I asked.</p> <p>He shrugged and said "I had to. The government's got to make laws and it is supposed to be one on one." He shrugged again and asked if they could help him.</p> <p>"Let me get them," I said before he could close his book.</p> <p>I reached inside his jacket and removed what I hoped was a very stiff tool. I grabbed his hair and yanked out of my trousers. His eyes were still looking at my leg when I had finished my punishment and told him to keep his hands away. I didn't want him to be angry with me. The others seemed to be watching and nodding or something. I had to smile at that for it made everyone of them. They liked how I had made them so compliant; they liked that I enjoyed tormenting them with my cock.</p> <p>I put my hands on the young man's shoulders and pulled him toward me. We were standing in the middle of the park, no more than a couple of blocks away. Just as we were about to enter the park, I leaned down and kissed him. He was confused. He turned his head to a side and I pulled his lips to mine, our tongues exploring and dancing. I felt his hands on the cheeks of my ass. I looked at him in the eye and he was smiling at me. We kissed again. He didn't try to enter or grab my cock for long. I was still hard as steel.</p> <p>"Oh my GOD," he whispered into my chest.</p> <p>Our lips parted and I looked at his eyes.</p> <p>"I would rather be in your pants," I answered before I kissed him one more time.</p> <p>"But..."</p> <p>"But you'd rather be in my pants than your lover right now."</p> <p>That's what he was saying, I thought. I pulled him around the bend. I held him up so that he could get the leverage he needed. I unzipped and pulled his uniform shirt out of his pants. It came down just past his waist and I ripped it completely off the waist of his pants for him to step out of. We stood like that for a long time. I had his clothes off almost before his pants came off.</p> <p>For a moment I thought he might try to resist the touch of the young man, but he didn't. I took his cock in my hand, he looked down at me.</p> <p>"Is there a problem here?" He grinned and held his hands up for me to remove them.</p> <p>"No, you look nice enough," I told him and kissed his chest. I moved to suck the soft skin, not into his crotch but around his navel which made him shudder. He kept his hands in my thick hair and I nibbled at his nipple and licked his belly. He stopped me and pushed me back so I fell down, his hands on my ass cheeks. I didn't object, I pulled my face from his tits and smiled at him. My erection was fully exposed.</p> <p>I dropped to my knees and took his cock in my mouth once again. He didnâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
