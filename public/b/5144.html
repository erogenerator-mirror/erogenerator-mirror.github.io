I asked.</p> <p>"I ... I don't know," she answered, "it's never done anything like that before."</p> <p>We continued with the conversation for a while longer, and it began to really feel like fun. We both enjoyed listening to one another, and it was great in a way I didn't understand.</p> <p>My mind kept returning to the first time I had felt the need to have a lesbian encounter. If I had not known it, I might have just made the same request more frequently. I had not been alone in my apartment, and the first thing I did was to start to get undressed. We were standing outside the door way, with only our clothes on - our arms around each other as we both watched each other walk to the steps.</p> <p>When we got to the steps, I leaned in and kissed her, with lips soft, and our tongues running the entire length of each other's mouths.</p> <p>Karen looked back at me with surprise in her eyes. "You're not really gay, are you?"</p> <p>I looked sheepishly at her, and could only reply, "Not as a matter of fact. . ."</p> <p>"It's your turn next," I answered.</p> <p>Karen reached out and grabbed my cock, then began to rub up and down it. She looked me in the eye again, and spoke, "This just may be the last time we ever do this."</p> <p>With that, she moved around the other room and back up the way I had come. This did it. I wanted to fuck her. I wanted to give her a taste of what she had experienced last night.</p> <p>I walked past her, and she turned to face me. I stood there, waiting what she may have to say.</p> <p>"Don't go anywhere. I want to go take a shower." She smiled, then turned back.</p> <p>I just stood there, thinking how sweet it would be to have her on top of me, just one more time like the first night. What better way to get back at her?</p> <p>The night had been good. She tasted like wine last night, of course, and what else?</p> <p>It was hard to say, but I do believe that if you want to live this out you should at least go have some fun with your wifeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
