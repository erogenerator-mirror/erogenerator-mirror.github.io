"A couple of times. It'll be okay, though."</p> <p>"Don't worry."</p> <p>"I don't want that," she added weakly, not seeming to be having a heart attack.</p> <p>With a little more conviction I gave her ass a slap. I thought she might even start feeling it. I think there was enough that was good.</p> <p>"Sorry," I replied, "I didn't mean to...I thought...that kind of thing. I'm just...I can wait 'til you're here and...I...don't... have to."</p> <p>"It'll be okay," she said after a few seconds of hesitation. She was breathing hard. "I'll just go back to bed and you can use the bathroom."</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>"Thank you, I really needed that. And thank you even...for being there."</p> <p>I went to get up and move the table.</p> <p>"Where are you going?" she yelled from the bathroom.</p> <p>"Out," I said.</p> <p>"Don't be silly, you know I love it."</p> <p>"Well, I sure do... but I gotta get back."</p> <p>I was really getting nervous. I couldn't believe that she would agree to my date with other women even if they were my wife...or my girlfriend. But then again, I couldn't believe that I had agreed to a date with other women. I couldn't believe that she still wanted to have sex with other men even if they were my wife. Even if she'd said yes to the date with others. As long as it didn't include another man.</p> <p>"Come on, wait around," she said with her hands on her hips. "I'm leaving when I want and then join you in the bathroom. I'll be in just a minute."</p> <p>"Okay...you know, we can't exactly..."</p> <p>"Just a minute, right? Do you seriously want to go to bed with another woman? This is your wedding day. Don't you think there's still a little more?" she laughed playfully.</p> <p>My wife's mood seemed to peter out at least a little.</p> <p>"That's not going to happen, you know. I'm not going to get any better than this. Please give me a second chance. And thanks again, for giving me this chance."</p> <p>It took me a couple minutes to decide to take her out to dinner and drink some champagne and relax without a ring.</p> <p>I'm not a good conversationalist either, but there she is. So that's where a couple of minutes ago with the champagne was all that mattered to me. But I guess it all added up to about 5 minutes.</p> <p>The champagne was a nice treat. And I'm not the only one who likes this place. The food was good, and the service was good. We had a couple different places to go and they were all very nice people. And the champagne was a wonderful distraction from the real reason she would be in my bed.</p> <p>We were both a bit tipsy, I admit. There was a lot of touching and petting, not to mention a very thorough fucking. The most amazing couple, really, was taking a table right beside the pool. And it seemed like the time to make a few stops for me to get my wife out of her seat. So that was it, and that's how I found myself back in her room with her panties stuffed in my mouth as far as they go.</p> <p>That night I went to bed early without making her cum. And she was gone by the time I got home.</p> <p>The next morning at work everyone was working on their jobs. The next three hours were pretty much wasted. Everyone was tired. And after what seemed like a long evening without having sex in the way, it was time to leave. I had no plans to go anywhere that evening.</p> <p>My wife left work at exactly 10:00 on her second afternoon.</p> <p>We had dinner together and then ended up back in her room.</p> <p>I was dressed like a fool as my wife was waiting for me to come out and join her when she came out of the bathroom. She was looking great. Even from where I was standing I could tell she hadn't had too much of an effect on me either. I knew some of her buttons were open and I could smell her perfume which I found extremely intoxicating on her.</p> <p>My cock was hard as steel by the time she finally got dressed. She didn't say much. She just walked around to the other side of the bed.</p> <p>"You going," she asked as she sat on the bed next to me.</p> <p>"No. I'm not," I repliedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
