There certainly wasn't a whole 'nother word' either.</p> <p>It suddenly occurred to me that maybe I had started to like it. It just felt...well, kind of...wrong and weird, and I wasn't sure how to describe it. So for the first time it seemed like the whole term "lover's" might have been used for myself. But it didn't feel right. It made me feel a little like a woman, like I was, and, as always when something was wrong or wrong was, I felt I could have changed it just by thinking about it. I began to feel confused and...I don't know what the right 'fuck' did to me, and I began to feel angry and frustrated.</p> <p>I had been in love with him at first, but I didn't think he was happy in my bed. He was always away from me. I didn't even know what "love" felt like. I liked sex, he had sex with me, and then, for the second time, I realized that I liked the sex of the different types of lovers. This was no different than sex with 'my boyfriend!' I was in love with him, I loved men and women. And while there was no way things would stay, 'if' it happened and there was no future, it was there. Just as there was only one point of view that could change it.</p> <p>It was the same with love. I could never tell him or any of the other women I had been with that he liked what he saw, so he would have known then he wasn't all that different. He had a bigger dick than I and I had, and he liked to watch, not just think it. I'm getting right where I had been, there were no other options.</p> <p>It was no different with sex, though. The sex was good, but it was a bit more...normal in comparison. After a while he started to feel a little odd and I was starting to feel strange again. I had my hand between us, rubbing her inner thighs and her pussy, and when she began to moan from that it sort of felt like it had an effect.</p> <p>I was sitting up, and she was leaning away from me. I leaned down so that I was kneeling on the floor and that she was in front of me.</p> <p>"This is what you wanted," I began. "I can fuck you, and get off, and it doesn't have to be so far off from your pussy."</p> <p>"Fuck me? I've never had a chance like this!" she said indignantly.</p> <p>I began to stroke her labia with my fingers and then she seemed to relax. I began to put two fingers inside her and found her hymen as I pushed them in and out. Her moans were growing louder, but she never broke eye contact with me.</p> <p>She was starting to breath hard and I slid my third finger into her and started to go deep. "Ah!" she moaned and I went a bit faster, my knuckles were pounding against her clit. She seemed to know she was going to come.</p> <p>"Ah!" she said again as she began to bounce on my hand, she was getting very quiet, "Ah! Fuck!"</p> <p>Her whole body seemed to go numb, and there was no longer any strength left in her. I began to slide my fingers back into her as I fingered her and continued in her pussy. My thumb seemed to be rubbing her peritoneum as she began to move on it. I didn't know what was happening, but I knew that there was a part of her that wanted it to cum, and that was her clit. It seemed to be pulsating, pulsating, pulsating. She began to groan, and her legs clamped on my hand harder.</p> <p>"Ah," she groaned as she came and came, "Ah! Ah!" a deep groan as she seemed to melt into me. We were silent for long moments, and then I heard a noise.</p> <p>"Shit, we're doing it," I heard a voice. We were all startled, so we looked at each other, startled again, and then looked up.</p> <p>This time it was Liza and I was in the doorway, and we were looking at the sight of her friend, who looked to be having sex with another woman.</p> <p>We walked over to our table and began to sit down. We weren't very close, so we heard her friend say something and she sat back and seemed to blush again. Liza was a beautiful woman, but she had always looked away at the sight of Liza sitting in her seat. I had a hard time believing that another woman had sex with herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
