You would need at least 10 guys to pull off a one-man fuck!"</p> <p>"Do you mean we could pull off a gang bang?"</p> <p>"Yes!"</p> <p>Allie said with a small smile.</p> <p>"Oh, you mean that you can't..."</p> <p>"That's right! We don't have to make the best of it."</p> <p>"Oh, God, yes! Yes, I could. Fuck me anyway you like. Just use a condom."</p> <p>"Yes, that's right."</p> <p>That day Allie had dressed again, and went to college.</p> <p>When I brought up the first time I thought of all these incredible, sexy guys and had an idea. Then I thought of this, and this made me feel like I was turning 18. This was where a sex life could really begin. I thought of my best experiences. The first times I had sex was memorable and so rewarding. My best sex, however, had to be with a guy the whole time. It just so happened that I had been with a woman. I had just finished a full-time job. It still took a few months before the first girl I tried had a chance at a date. I felt like such a kid again. I mean, it was way after the high school years, and I mean, I still wanted a guy. But a guy...</p> <p>"Honey, what would you do without a man?"</p> <p>"Maybe we would make a living with sex."</p> <p>"I am not talking about a man. It's all about sex. Men have sex with the woman they please. So I guess your definition of sex is: I need to be fucked."</p> <p>"Oh."</p> <p>"It is such a big deal."</p> <p>We never talked about it again, but I was glad I did. Sometimes I really hated girls. But they just looked so cute and nice.</p> <p>"I get it. I just don't trust women."</p> <p>"Maybe you can find a woman to love."</p> <p>"That might work."</p> <p>"Hey, if it doesn't work, I won't either."</p> <p>I don't know why people look at me like I have some strange way of getting through life. A lot of times I don't think, let alone think, I have sex with men, either. But I always tell myself that that's only an idea. What else? When I think of it, I don't usually think about it. I mean, some guys would get aroused by it when they knew I was a woman, but none of us could actually do that. Sometimes even guys really got turned on. I guess it's just a male response to my female sexuality that I feel like a woman being sexual, right?</p> <p>It's one reason I was so determined to be a woman. Why do it just seem so easy? Why do we always have to try to find out, and then wait for the right one? Why do we have to always talk about things and just go with it? And of course, where do we even start?</p> <p>I guess it's my big surprise that I had so many sex lives to myself. I think it's so much hotter than before. I have found myself with two different boyfriends that are so much more than just a guy. I love it when we spend time naked and just chat, and I get so excited, it's like I'm at school again instead of with my high school teacher. I have no idea why that makes me want to make an effort. There's just something about that I just can't quite explain. When I'm with people, I'm just happy to be a woman. And as I said, I still think about it as an opportunity to explore my sexuality. A lot. It's just one of those things that just has to happen.</p> <p>The fact is, for most of the time when I do it, I really feel as if I'm getting ready to be a woman. And at the same time I still feel that my big surprise to me is a new sexual experience for me. In other words, being a woman is something that I have never really had the opportunity to experience. I can't explain it. I don't think I'm ready to be a woman anymore. I'm just still as I am. It's just going to take some time to work out what to do with all this, and maybe I'll just move on. For me to even be a man again is not going to happen, it's just an experience. It's different when you've been with guys, so I guess it takes time to really get into it. I mean, how can you change a woman in a sexual way for a lifetime?</p> <p>I didn't want a woman to be my new wife. I think I should just move on. Maybe that tooâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
