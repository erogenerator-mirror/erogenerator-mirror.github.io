Now it was my turn to moan, "Yes. Yes. Fuck me. Please fuck me now."</p> <p>I took a hold of the edge of the counter and helped her to slowly slide backwards, sliding my cock deep into her cunt. She was wet to the point where I was able to slip into her easily. As I did this I could feel Beth's cunt muscles gripping and squeezing the end of my cock. I was really beginning to like this. Not just because Beth was so well lubricated that there could be no going back. Beth's cunt was much tighter and I could feel it tightening and loosening on my cock as I slid inside her.</p> <p>Beth leaned back against the counter so that her feet could go on either side of me. As she slid herself up and down on my shaft I felt her tits on my back and could tell she was kissing me, and that was enough to make me start fucking her again. This time more slowly. Her legs were around my own midsection.</p> <p>Beth was clearly enjoying my cock. After a couple more strokes like this I could feel her cunt relax even more, letting her juices slide back down onto my shaft as she came down. I then started fucking her faster, harder, trying to get my cock deep into her.</p> <p>As I did this Beth leaned down so that she could kiss me again and begin to stroke my cock faster. It wasn't long before she was breathing hard, obviously just experiencing the best experience she had had in a long time. It wasn't long after this that I shot my load, all of my cum being injected deep into Beth's cunt.</p> <p>Beth must have had many orgasms, she was probably still coming down from her last one before I started to get soft. It was nice to be so close to a beautiful and willing woman. We kissed lovingly, our hands working over each other and finally I sat myself on the bed. Beth collapsed in my arms, with her head on my shoulder. I let her feel it all for a moment then I turned around and gave her a kiss. I leaned her back against the cool sheet of the bed, then my head moved from side to side. With my free hand I found and massaged her nipples as we both watched the light flicks of the TV on the television.</p> <p>When I eventually finished rubbing Beth's nipples she rolled over onto her right side, snuggled under my arm, and started snoring quietly. I layed there for a few seconds, enjoying the closeness of our bodies and the sight of Beth in the moonlight.</p> <p>When I got up and put on my underwear Beth awoke. She didn't see or hear me. "Why didn't you put something on, that was wonderful." She smiled warmly. We lay together for a while, sharing many kisses, then she whispered, "Why didn't you get dressed?"</p> <p>"I was thinking about you," I said quietly. "I don't ever get dressed." We kissed again and kissed a couple more times before getting up to go to the bathroom. As I opened the door I saw Beth cleaning off the cum that had covered her cunt and ass after me. We were alone. Beth was still sleeping. I thought that was odd because she rarely came to bed that day and I hadn't had more than a couple of orgasms in the last 24 hours.</p> <p>Beth turned toward me and looked at me. "You fucked me so good," she whispered. Then she kissed me. We kissed for a long time, then she said, "You know what? I'm done. You will get over to that college and be a nice guy."</p> <p>"You don't give me enough time to think about it."</p> <p>She kissed me again then looked at me and saw that she would have to get dressed. "Don't you remember what I told you about a date? A guy, a relationship."</p> <p>I smiled. "Of course," I said. "I wasn't sure whether you were the same guy you are tonight. But I had to make sure you knew how special you are."</p> <p>"Did you like my date?" she asked.</p> <p>"It was lovely." I laughed. "There's something else about you I like a lot. It's part of what makes a good friend. No more thinking about me."</p> <p>Beth moved to lay next to me on the bed, then kissed me again. "You really liked that."</p> <p>"It was fun." I replied, giving her a kiss. "I never saw one like the one I have today."</p> <p>"Did you like the woman?"</p> <p>"I liked what I saw." I replied. "And the woman?"</p> <p>Beth started laughing.
