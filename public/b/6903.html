I have the work weekend."</p> <p>"I can't. That would be too weird."</p> <p>"But I can come over."</p> <p>"Okay." I said. And so the next day, I got there and she came by with my bags. There was nothing in the house which made them unusual, and just as I was carrying my bag, she came over.</p> <p>"Is this okay? I mean what do you want?"</p> <p>"Don't worry about it. I want to talk with you. I'm only going to be an hour or so. I can't be long."</p> <p>They sat down and started talking for quite a while. And as time passed, they decided to let me go. We went out to dinner that night. I had a lot on my mind as I looked forward to what was sure to come.</p> <p>We didn't talk at all the next week. I only got a text to let me know when she picked me up next time.</p> <p>The next week, I was not as productive as I'd hoped. The day arrived and I came home again. Then Thursday. I could have gone to work, but the day got really busy. I went out after work, and picked up a cake. The night I got home, I called out to her.</p> <p>"Hey, you there? You're not here. Did you forget I talked with you at work?"</p> <p>"Yeah, but I'm not going home now. And I don't want no trouble tonight."</p> <p>"Okay. You are here, where? And where can I come by tomorrow?</p> <p>"I don't know. I don't want to drive home and change my mind, so I have some work that I need to get done, and no, I don't want to go home yet."</p> <p>"But don't you want to see me tonight?"</p> <p>"Can I come back tomorrow then?"</p> <p>"Sure."</p> <p>I took the cake with me to my apartment building. There were no cars. There was a note stuck on the front door that read 'No going home yet, just call tomorrow evening at 5 p.m.'</p> <p>I called her the following day. The phone rang a second later. "Hello?"</p> <p>"Hey, what are you doing home?"</p> <p>"I'm about to hang up and talk to you. Did you call?"</p> <p>"Yeah, I did. It should be tomorrow at 5 p.m., right?"</p> <p>"Yeah. Let's do that."</p> <p>I called her the next day and asked her to come for dinner about 6 p.m.</p> <p>"Okay. It's 7 p.m. I'll be out there."</p> <p>So they both came and spent the afternoon together. And before I knew it, my birthday present to them had arrived. I drove my car to and parked outside their apartment. I sat there for a long time in my car, taking in the sights. We sat for nearly an hour. They had a bottle of wine sitting there on the couch, and sat next to each other, sipping their wine. It was a romantic moment for the both of them. She said something to him and then kissed his cheek.</p> <p>"It was an accident. He had his hand over my mouth, I don't want him to know I kissed him." She said.</p> <p>"It's okay. He doesn't look at me like that all the time."</p> <p>"We just wanted you to see us. He was really sweet to you."</p> <p>"That's sweet too. I'm glad you didn't think it was my fault."</p> <p>"Me too. Anyway, I want to talk to you in bed, and then I want to talk to you about something."</p> <p>"Yeah, that's fine."</p> <p>She leaned over and kissed him. The kiss opened her mouth and she let her tongue enter his mouth. His arms went around her and he kissed her back. Then she lifted her face and said that she wished she had told me they had been going the other night, just after I was born. We kissed for a long time, and she slipped her hand into his jeans, grabbed something and went down on him.</p> <p>"Ooh. I thought you told me you were not going to let me have oral sex?"</p> <p>"Yeah. That's what I said."</p> <p>"I have never done it that way. It's not right. He's my boss."</p> <p>"He can't do that to you. We have to get him off your mind, and you know that."</p> <p>"I know. But I really wanted to hear you tell me that."</p> <p>"No. I know you can't say that, it's not right. And that you just have to listen to my advice and make the decision onâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
