I could feel her juices sliding along my cock through the thin fabric of my boxers but it did nothing to cool my rising and as my penis grew to full length inside of her. The feel of her body against me, her pussy moving over my cock was the ultimate physical stimulation of the moment, the only difference being that my hardness was not at full length but was now almost fully penetrating her.</p> <p>"I love you, honey," she whispered to me, her head resting on my chest her arms wrapped around my back. "I'm so nervous."</p> <p>I smiled inwardly and replied, "I know. I can help your nerves."</p> <p>"And I won't tell anyone, will I?" she replied. "I have to be careful, I swear!"</p> <p>"I know," I agreed. "But I think it will calm you down later and we can try other ways."</p> <p>"I'll do anything you want, sweetheart," she said leaning over kissing me again on the mouth.</p> <p>"Anything I want," I added kissing her again. After kissing her a long time, we both knew that we would eventually start to make our own way back to reality. Neither of us were ready to leave the other just yet.</p> <p>After we rested our eyes in each other's, we looked at each other. She turned on her side with her head on my chest. My hand slid over her back down her sides and reached her hip and slowly down her stomach, gently touching her pubic hair. We smiled at each other as we continued playing with each other's bodies. Then I ran my fingertips over her pussy lightly as she continued to slowly stroke my stiffening penis which had grown to an impressive size.</p> <p>"Mmmm!" she exclaimed with pleasure, "That feels incredible!"</p> <p>"Let me know when you're ready to do something else, Sweetheart!"</p> <p>"Mmmmm, I will!" she moaned in reply giving me a tender French kiss.</p> <p>I placed my hand across my lips lightly brushing it with my thumb that sent a chill up her body causing me to shiver. I brought my other hand up and began tracing the contours of her lips as she stroked my cock with her hand.</p> <p>"You taste delicious!" I said with a wink.</p> <p>Smiling, she raised her leg to my thigh and wrapped a leg around my hip and placed her crotch on my erect cock.</p> <p>"It's time to start a new experience, honey," she said as she rocked her hips back and forth slowly and I could feel the warmth of her vaginal walls moving over me.</p> <p>"I'm ready, now!" she intoned pulling her hips away and then slowly entering me, letting me feel her moistness as she slowly impaled herself on my cock.</p> <p>I could feel our pubic bones touching as she pushed herself onto me, pulling my lips to hers as she sat on me while my erection made its entrance inside of her. The feel of our pubic bones pressing together together, with a single, slow movement, made me feel as if I were the last person on Earth that would be going to experience the incredible sensation of a woman's soft and velvety channel around me.</p> <p>"Oh!" she exclaimed pulling her head back as I slid inside of her fully.</p> <p>As soon as I was buried deep inside of her, we hugged each other tightly.</p> <p>"Oh my, honey!" she exclaimed again as we started to rock slowly together on the edge of the bed. "It has been so beautiful being with you!"</p> <p>"I'm glad," I responded taking our time to undressed her while holding her as she lay on top of my body.</p> <p>As her hand made access to my crotch and found my stiff shaft it began to throb in my hand and it started to hurt to move it so quickly.</p> <p>"I need you to lay on your back in the middle of the bed, sweetheart," I said to her as I knelt beside the bed, kneeling above her and placing my head on the pillow.</p> <p>Laying down, she laid back and then started to turn her head and begin kissing me again on my neck while my throbbing penis made its presence known in her vagina.</p> <p>"That'll make it easier. Do you mind if I suck on that sweet penis while you go down on me, okay?" she asked me.</p> <p>"I do not mind," I answered. I did want to suck on her.</p> <p>"You have lovely breasts, sweetheart," she whispered softly before kissing me again on myâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
