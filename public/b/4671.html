I said. "He's like a tiger now, that's all. And I like it."</p> <p>"So are he all over you? That's why it didn't work out with your friend."</p> <p>"Yeah... he's a tiger. He's really tough around the edges, but not always aggressive."</p> <p>"So, you like him, do you?"</p> <p>"Yeah, he's fun to be with, but also kind of dangerous." I said. I was so out of it, not knowing what to say or do. I realized how much I wanted that other guy in my life and what the hell kind of life I had in mind for him.</p> <p>We sat on the patio eating and talking. I couldn't stop looking at the man next to me. I had never seen him here before. And now I wondered what had happened to cause this other man to become my boyfriend. It didn't look like this guy was going to leave my side again. It looked like he was planning on moving on after he'd had a taste of my body, so to speak. The fact that I could see him thinking about me as I was thinking about another guy probably added a lot to my feelings for him.</p> <p>"So what's your name?" I asked when we were finally eating dinner.</p> <p>"I'm John." he said.</p> <p>"And you?"</p> <p>"Pauli."</p> <p>"Oh god... I hate to break up what's left of my friendships like that," Pauli joked.</p> <p>"Well, you're here, aren't you?" I said, reaching across the table and taking his hand and pulling him to me. "It wasn't any choice you know!"</p> <p>"It won't go any further, lover."</p> <p>I had a little bit of difficulty replying to him. I had felt things that Pauli wasn't as passionate as, not for very long, but it felt nice after the emotional roller coaster he'd been on for over eight months. I'd never felt anything like that in my life.</p> <p>But he had said it when it came to my sexual needs, and that had been the hardest part of the entire conversation before. I was going to make him feel better about it, just a little. We made small talk over dinner and talked about the weather and what Pauli's dad lived the suburbs of Detroit for and how he had helped find his family in the middle of the war. Pauli was good at lying. He told me about his work and then made a joke about it and I actually laughed. He didn't tell me that he was a virgin, he didn't even touch or anything. I had no idea what that little drama had put him through, but I knew it couldn't be good. But, I felt like Pauli was telling my best friend all the same. I hadn't felt this way in a long time, and was starting to wonder what it was going to be like with him. I thought Pauli would eventually take the bait, because then we'd be in that conversation again.</p> <p>I decided it was time to go. We hadn't got along since I'd been in college with my boyfriend. He didn't really have a father like my father in the Army, he never talked to me that way. But Pauli had just had a baby. I was really starting to think that Pauli was losing his touch. His lack of any sort of romantic feelings for me was getting to me.</p> <p>"Maybe we should go out for awhile, I'm kind of tired," I said to Pauli, holding his hand to steady him.</p> <p>Pauli looked at me and smiled. He really seemed as if he liked where the conversation was going, so I told him that he could hang back a bit and rest up for a bit, but we had a couple of hours and we both had another one of those beer commercials for a few minutes. I thought we'd both need a break from it all with some rest. Maybe I could even use Pauli to catch up with what was going on in his world.</p> <p>"I'd love to go," I said. "But it would be hard to say no to you."</p> <p>"I know, but I don't want to ruin the surprise!" Pauli told me. "And after I get home, I really want you to stop by."</p> <p>"It would be really nice to," I said, hoping he was in some kind of position to see the whole thing through.</p> <p>Pauli was about to get up so I took my hand and pulled him to me to kiss him on the cheek and then walked him to his car. In my car, on the way to his house, I thought that maybe I might just do something about this, but I didn't. I was hoping that he was just going to go back toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
