He responded a little angrily. "Why don't you come over for dinner, we'll figure something out."</p> <p>"I would rather go home and look through the trash than sit by the pond," she said as she walked behind her father. With a deep sigh she went about gathering up the discarded clothing in a large, neat pile under the sink and started off toward the pond.</p> <p>"Honey?" Her father called out, startled again by his daughter's appearance.</p> <p>"Who is it?" she replied, walking to the house cautiously as her father followed.</p> <p>"Dawn, this is Darrin, my old friend and my son in crime. We met in the park and, I must tell you, look pretty. You must be some beauty." He said, his voice rising slightly as he took the chair in the middle of the room. Dawn, who was kneeling in the water in the tub, looked nervous at her father's eyes as he spoke. A smile came to her face as she saw tears welling in her eyes. Her father placed a hand on her shoulder and gently pulled her away as he leaned over her at the edge of the tub.</p> <p>"Dawn, honey," he said as he took her hand in his and kissed the back of her hand. She looked up at him, a nervous smile on her face, then back up at her father. "Come with me." He said as he reached for her hand, then pulled her into his arms. He led her back to the living room, placing her down on the loveseat and pulling her into a tight embrace. Her knees were shaking and the tears slowly began to dry, but she didn't want to let go and feel that warmth.</p> <p>"Dawn," he said in a calm voice as he began to unbutton his suit shirt. When it was open, he pulled her away from the loveseat and slowly pushed her down onto her knees, and began caressing her face with his palm as tears began to fall and run down her cheeks. Dawn watched with growing anticipation as her father took his time opening the suit and gently placing her face between his muscular arms. As he ran his hand down her cheek and onto her chin, she felt his breath against her nose and she inhaled deeply as his hot, slightly salty scent intoxicated her senses. Her lips parted instantly to his and their tongues eagerly intertwined. Her heart beat a little faster as the moment passed and her heart filled with joy as they met in the warmth of their embrace.</p> <p>Her body tingled and her mouth began to water with the thought of him, and she loved him. She felt his hands on her back and backside as he gently caressed her. Determined to wait until she fell asleep, she turned over and gazed up at her father as he began to unbutton the top of her blouse. He helped her remove her blouse and sat down on the loveseat, taking her hands in his as he began to remove her bra.</p> <p>"Dawn honey," her father whispered huskily as he began to kiss the soft skin under her arms. She could feel that his hardness against her as her father continued to undress her slowly. He slowly pulled her to him as she sat on the loveseat, then leaned back as his hands began to stroke her back. She looked up at him with fear in her own eyes, but he just smiled down at her and kissed her lightly on the lips. He let go of her once she was laid down as he pulled her shorts off and quickly began to rub himself as her lips parted with lust. He lowered himself between her outstretched legs and ran himself up and under her legs as she reached for him. Dawn reached down to help pull her father along until he was at her side, then began to run her hands up his chest to his face, rubbing all over as she watched him.</p> <p>"Is this for real, darling?" she whispered, reaching up to kiss him before reaching down, to feel her father's nakedness against her. "Are you sure?" Dawn asked again as her fingers began to run up and down his chest, then onto his legs. "I want to feel your touch allover me." Dawn said, a smile playing at the end of her lips. She could feel her pussy tingling, and she knew her father wanted her to feel that too as he slid down her legs and pulled her panties off. "Is this for real or are you playing with yourself?" she asked again as she reached down to slide her hand down his cock and back up again. "Is this my touch, Daddy," Dawn whispered as she leaned her face down and moved her face down beside him. She had him lay on his back and she kneeled over him, with her mouth on his cock.</p> <p>He raised her head to watch Dawnâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
