I mean, really? You could get fired for making fun of me at school.'</p> <p>"But at least you can go on working with me now," she responded. "I had a new friend yesterday. She helped me with some homework and did a lot of my homework."</p> <p>A week later, we were having coffee at my house. "I guess I'll start. You have a good day and a good night with your folks?" I told her, "They are both gone for the weekend."</p> <p>She agreed and we made plans to meet on Friday at an Italian restaurant. We met out there. Our waiter, who has an incredible accent, introduced me to his lovely neighbor. He asked where I was staying and I told him, "Don't bother, I'll just get my coat."</p> <p>He came back with my coat. He handed some things to the waiter. "You can pick up the food to get you ready. This way it won't be so conspicuous," he said.</p> <p>I said, "Yes, that's fine. I just changed, so, um, I've changed into something casual."</p> <p>I was a little surprised that he thought that the food and the wine were in season. I'm sure some of my neighbors are casual in this city. I couldn't tell whether they thought we were lovers.</p> <p>We waited until the waiter was ready to come back. "We'll have to walk along the street for a moment," said the waiter. Then he said, "I've got more room."</p> <p>I said, "I'm not sure there's a better way." He went to change his clothes, but I insisted on getting a robe and a nightdress. We stood and put the robe on. We walked along the street for another minute. I saw two men looking at us, as we were walking slowly.</p> <p>When we entered the restaurant it was a little chilly. "There's only one chair in your place," said the waiter. So, we sat opposite each other at the table. "It's getting late and we'll have a few minutes to get our coats. We may be having dinner, but that is only for a quick drink on the way home. We have to be at the party at eight, and I think you would go with me."</p> <p>I was disappointed. I was looking forward to the whole evening, and my cock had already began to harden. "This looks great," I told the waiter. He agreed.</p> <p>I thought the waiter was sweet. He had been a good waiter and had gone out of his way to help me out of this place. It would be the perfect occasion to find out what the waiter had to offer.</p> <p>We got some food delivered to our room. The waiter brought the food and a bottle of chilled white wine. We had the table set up for dessert when we got the dessert service. The waiter asked the waiter to put the two plates down on the tray and bring out the dessert. I had placed the two plates on the bed.</p> <p>The serving dishes were all the same. A couple of plates and two forks and two glasses of wine. I was hungry. "Did you have a change of mind?" I asked the waiter.</p> <p>"I was just thinking of going out with you."</p> <p>"But, I don't want to go out and pick on your ass. I just want to have a lot of fun," I told him.</p> <p>"I'll get the champagne. You should go to the wine department. We'll have a drink," he said.</p> <p>There was not much I could do. The waiter, who had to go all the way to the counter to get our glasses of champagne while I was trying to order, walked to the kitchen door. "If not, wait outside and I'll go outside."</p> <p>Then he returned holding our glasses. He poured the champagne and I had a quick toast to a wonderful evening. I was happy to tell him that the table was set up at the room's entrance, so he got the tables out.</p> <p>We were chatting when the champagne arrived. "It's very good having champagne," he said, as he sat down across from me. "I'm going to pick this table back up about eight."</p> <p>I did like he picked up my table, and the waiter had a wonderful place to get a meal. When we came back to the table, he was very attentive so I enjoyed his kindness.</p> <p>We had a wonderful evening together. He was attentive and always looked out for my wellbeing. He didn't interfere with what little I could do in the busy world of the officeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
