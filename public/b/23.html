I stood up and quickly pulled my cock from her mouth. She grabbed it and moved the head to her lips and began suckling while her hand continued sucking. When she came up for air, she was gasping for air and looked around nervously. I took both of her nipples in my hands and twisted them slightly.</p> <p>She gasped. "I'm sorry," she said, as though it were very real.</p> <p>"I know you're not sorry -- you think I need more."</p> <p>My wife nodded in agreement.</p> <p>"You will do as you are told. I'm not mad about the taste of it. You are not either. Now, off with your hands."</p> <p>She looked up again and immediately lifted the hem of her skirt. As I watched, the wet spot on the front of the skirt caught my eye. I raised my eyes to see whether I could discern the scent of her arousal from the wetness of her thigh. She wore no panties. I could clearly see a thick, brown bush just inches from where my head lay on her stomach.</p> <p>"Put your arms behind your knees."</p> <p>When she had done this, I pulled her around to face me. She immediately placed both hands behind her knees and raised her body to her elbows. With each thrust, I pushed forward just an inch or two, until my cock touched her pelvis. With each pass against her pussy lips, my cock continued to prod her lips.</p> <p>"Put your feet flat on the ground." I instructed. When she complied, she leaned back onto her elbows, exposing her naked tits for me.</p> <p>I grabbed them easily with both hands, and lifted them toward me. As I did, the cleft in the skin between her pussy lips grew even darker. She opened them and my cock slid easily between them, deep into her tunnel. I closed my eyes to enjoy the feel of her cunt as I took her in. She arched her back and placed her hands behind her knees.</p> <p>My hands continued to work their way up to her tits. I gently caressed them before squeezing them. I could feel how hard and erect they were.</p> <p>"That's it, Baby," I said. "Play with them. I will let you do that anytime."</p> <p>My wife did as she was told, running her hands along the outside of her breasts, occasionally pausing at her nipples. She caressed her breasts lightly and pinched them gently while I continued to work her breasts. She had no panties on, and I could feel her labia pressing against my cock.</p> <p>"Put your body on top of mine," I said. "I want to eat and make love to you."</p> <p>She raised up and straddled my body with her legs. When I spread her knees apart and put my head between them, I could feel the silkiest of hairs on my cock and balls brushing her wet, open labia.</p> <p>"I'm not supposed to say. Now. Fuck me, Baby. Fuck me." She whispered. "Make love to me."</p> <p>Her words did not seem as though they were meant to be coming from a mouth. This was an urgent need, and for the first time in my life, I realized that I had to talk to her. I wanted her to be on top, so I pushed my tongue between her lips, probing her mouth. She opened and accepted it before she became a bit frantic. It made me think of the taste of her juices -- and I had known of course that it would come in spurts. Her tongue became more active within her mouth, and she sucked it gently. I reached down to caress her tits, which had become much more perky. I felt fingers squeezing her nipples, and I could hear her whimpering. I could tell that she was very aroused and her body felt hot to my touch.</p> <p>I felt fingers on the shaft of my cock, and she lifted the head high, rubbing it against her clit. The feeling of her lips rubbing against my cock was more exciting than the previous time. It felt very different, and I could feel my own cock throb as I rubbed it in her pussy. She moaned, and I felt her body shake.</p> <p>"Oh, God." She said over and over. "Eat me. Oh, baby, it's so good."</p> <p>I kept rubbing the head of my cock around against her clit, then in circles around the little pink pearl. The sensations I felt from her pussy were wonderful. She was obviously enjoying it, as she was gasping and grinding against my bodyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
