I was confused and upset, but also very comfortable with what I just told her.</p> <p>A bit later, we got a few more questions and I gave them to her, and asked her what she had told her father, where she came from, whether she had never told her brother. She told a bit about her life, and about her mother, and about her father. Finally, she looked at her father.</p> <p>"My mother never said it was right to do anything like this, or that I should do it. Mom was just mad. Dad, is that true, or is he just using you, or is it a bit like sex... well, I know the answer, I mean, I think you had a great sexual experience. You're a normal healthy young man; I'm sure you will be doing some of it with many women I know, some in particular, and I believe that it can happen to all people. When I ask, if you are saying no, please think carefully, if you want to continue, I understand. Now you better go home, I'll talk to you tomorrow morning, see you back here at the club."</p> <p>She looked at me and smiled.</p> <p>"Hmmm that's it, do you still have a hard time getting the answers you asked me about. I guess it would be better to just see what happens."</p> <p>We hugged, and walked out and down the corridor to my apartment complex. It was very quiet. She was very quiet. For the first time, I felt sorry for her. I didn't know what to do. Her parents might not be home, or it may be a big misunderstanding, and in retrospect, it probably wasn't a big misunderstanding, but at some level, it probably would remain a major misunderstanding. But at least that was what I rationalized; the real reason for it was to keep her safe and warm while she got older, and if things got out of control, so be it. At this time, I was still aching for her, feeling very ashamed and embarrassed. I didn't even know what I felt, but I also didn't realize that her father was doing this with me, and I liked it a lot.</p> <p>I was in the apartment and sat down with a glass of lemonade. As I sat and thought, I realized a lot about my life, about my daughter, and about my past. I could hardly believe how this worked up. I realized that my past would be going with her, just in the sense that she would take care of me, and my job and future life. Would she be happy with my choices in life? Maybe, my fear of the future that might be, but it wouldn't be my life I decided I would never choose.</p> <p>I felt stupid and selfish. I looked out at the street and smiled. Then I saw a young girl in the crowd waving to me. A few blocks away I saw what she had just seen and decided to head back. I decided to stay for a few more hours, take a cab home, and see if everything would go well again. Maybe she was having some difficulties. Maybe she was having trouble getting the answers she had been asking me about, then I didn't know.</p> <p>As my thoughts went back to my conversation with Helen, I heard a female voice.</p> <p>"What was that about dad?"</p> <p>"About something, maybe."</p> <p>"Maybe?"</p> <p>"Maybe. But I'm not seeing a lawyer; I didn't know if mom and dad were still on-us."</p> <p>"I think your mom and dad are back already, or at least that's our guess."</p> <p>"Let's go meet them. Then I'll get mom. I think I might not even be home till later."</p> <p>She had made a friend, I thought. She had also asked me about my life, and I'd had a few drinks. I was not surprised. She had made a lot of friends. What was a problem for her? Was she afraid of me, or would I just be a jerk?</p> <p>Helen led me back to her apartment. She had to be getting out of bed for a meeting. I was in the room and walked into the bathroom to take a shower. I had a good, strong shower and I was clean. Then I heard the bathroom door open, and footsteps, and the sound of heavy breathing. Suddenly, I felt very warm, very content. I knew that I wanted to be just like her, this moment.</p> <p>I went to bed with her two beds, one near the window and one near a wall. We had a shower as we got undressed, and she started out with the top buttonâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
