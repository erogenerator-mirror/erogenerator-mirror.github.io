"It's a nice dress."</p> <p>"Come over here and let me pull it off you."</p> <p>"Not tonight," she said as she stood and stepped out of his grasp. Slowly, lovingly, she stood as he unzipped her dress. As it fell to the floor, she pushed herself toward him, causing the hem to slide up her legs, where it stopped at her waist, and the panties to slide up, slowly, gently.</p> <p>"Put your hands in the straps," he said, gesturing toward the back of the dress. She did so, slipping the spaghetti straps from her shoulders, letting the material drape down her arms and fall to the floor. She took a step toward him, as if a light switch had turned on.</p> <p>"Merry Christmas," she said in a small, loving smile, pulling the halter neck forward over her breasts, and letting it drop to the floor and pool up at her ankles.</p> <p>"I meant... Christmas... when... when I'd be... Christmas."</p> <p>He reached for the waistband of her panties and she stepped back, sliding the panties down over her ass to where they'd pooled around her ankles. "It's not your turn now," he smiled, sliding his hands down over her ass and down to her thighs as he stepped out of the panties.</p> <p>"No, not that. You'll have to take them off."</p> <p>She stepped back slowly as he lifted the sides of her panties over her round hips a moment, then dropped them to her feet. He was still holding them in his hands when she stepped out of them, kicking them aside along with her panties. Finally, she stepped into them, stepping out of them as slowly as she could. He looked at her. Her body was a beautiful, pale blue-green, with wisps of red on her arms and legs, which were now a lighter shade of green, matching her eyes, her eyelashes, between lips. Her chest was small and her breasts held no stretch marks on her chest, though her nipples were hard and pointy.</p> <p>Her legs were long and slim, shapely, and seemed to reach out for a man as far as they did. Her thighs were tight and her calves seemed to wrap around him, and his hands were able to cup them without effort, but they were soft and strong, and felt wonderful in his hands. He looked her over. Not perfect just for being a young couple, but she had just been beautiful and sexy.</p> <p>"I want to see what you're hiding," he said.</p> <p>She stepped into his arms and they kissed and embraced as they stood there, her back to his chest. She took him in her arms, and again they stood there, kissing and hugging for a moment, just touching and enjoying each other as they breathed and were lost in the sensations. Finally, they broke their embrace and looked each other in the eyes, and with a smile, he pulled her close and they kissed again.</p> <p>"Merry Christmas... the first time," she said with a big smile on her beautiful lips. He pulled back, taking a quick breath, and nodded.</p> <p>"Merry Christmas," she said.</p> <p>He put his arms back around her and bent his head down to capture her lips. As their lips pressed and their tongues touched, he felt a tingle in his groin that had nothing to do with his pants. With his head leaning down, he could look deep into her beautiful blue eyes as they kissed.</p> <p>When she saw that he had noticed, she smiled, and stepped back to help him up his feet. He smiled and leaned down to kiss her again, his hands slipping over her breasts again, sliding in the cleft between them and squeezing the soft flesh gently as he kissed her. The kiss was long and drawn, long and soft, deep and full of promise. She wanted it to last forever.</p> <p>"Is this... is it really you?"</p> <p>"Oh, it's the real me... you... you love me," she replied softly. They looked at each other again and kissed again, their lips parted and the world beginning to tilt.</p> <p>"Yes," he said. "I love you."</p> <p>"Oh, I love you." They were both smiling when they broke their embrace. He looked down and saw the panties. The tiny little bow would be so sexy. He held them out as he looked at them. "Here," he said, "for you," motioning to the panties.</p> <p>"Merry Christmas," she said, dropping them with a soft smile and turning to him with a smile. They stood, a little reluctantly, facing each other, holding hands and kissing again.</p> <p>As they walkedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
