I'm sorry," she said, as she stood up and hugged me tightly.</p> <p>"I am not!" I shouted. "I will not hurt you, if you want to play hide-and-seek, but can I at least let you take your bra off first, so that you are not afraid of me walking in front of you?" I asked, in a quivering voice, trying to understand her need for control over me.</p> <p>"I can play along, if you want to play with me right now," she whispered. "Let's go, before we're discovered."</p> <p>"I think," I breathed, "that you should just keep on with the game. I can't walk around in a bra, at least not this time. I am going to take it from here."</p> <p>She smiled, and turned around, pulling me behind her as we hurried down a hallway toward a door. I took her out on to the back of the house, where a window seat was visible through a small window in the wall. I helped her on to the seat and told her it was just right for her. I sat down in the chair opposite her, and took her feet.</p> <p>The leather had become a very good cushion of our soft leather seats. As she spread her legs and rested her feet in the middle of the seat, I leaned forward and started kissing her thighs, her ankles, and her ankles. I sucked each toe on one side, and slowly pulled each one until it was sticking straight out from under her ass. When she spread her legs wide once more, I could finally slip my mouth over her pussy, my tongue circling her clit. She sighed in pleasure. I used the same trick on her other leg, moving slowly up to lick and suck them all the way to her pussy. I could hardly get the little ballgag out of her mouth, it was so tight.</p> <p>When she took her mouth off mine and looked at me, it was as if she had no idea I was kneeling beside her. I had a brief but very exciting thought that this could only be the tip of one of my many fingers, which, I realized, she would never take off. I got the whole thing into my mouth, sliding it slowly in and out. I could feel it hitting the back of my throat every time I slid it up inside. She sighed and I reached underneath her, cupping her breast in my hand, the nipple hard against the cloth of her bra. I gently squeezed her breast, and lifted her hard nipple. Then I leaned forward, biting the sensitive flesh on the inside of one of her legs as I slid my tongue over her pussy, moving in and out slowly, over and over, licking the inside of her thighs. I heard a moan, and moved my tongue up.</p> <p>I licked and sucked the other leg, and moved back to her, spreading her pussy lips wider as I slid my tongue inside her slit. She smelled wonderful, and I thought I would die with joy before she could even feel this delicious pleasure. I moved my tongue up and started to tongue-fuck her, using quick, deep strokes to the back of her vagina with great enthusiasm. I felt as if she had lost control of herself. After a few minutes, she took my head lightly in her hands, guiding me where she wanted me to go. I licked her clit a few more times, then raised myself up her thigh, and slid my middle finger inside her pussy, making her moan and moan yet more.</p> <p>While I continued my tongue lashing of her clit and the back of her pussy, I brought my fingers up a bit and slipped them in and out, causing her to squirm underneath me. I felt her hands tighten on the back of my head, and she started to grind herself down against me, in circles, slowly, but firmly increasing her pleasure. I knew she was coming, and I licked her faster and harder, while sliding my fingers in and out of her pussy, bringing her to yet another shuddering spasm. I had never climaxed so quickly in my whole life. Her orgasm must have lasted for a minute, then subsided. For her part, she started pushing her crotch harder against my face, then pushing away.</p> <p>"No! Stay there!" she whimpered. I raised myself up, still kneeling in front of her.</p> <p>"OK," I said, "but you must be on your back." I lowered myself until I sat in an upright position, then sat back on my knees. I looked down between my legs with a mischievous grin, at her, her breathing getting faster as she looked back up at the ceiling.</p> <p>"Now, I want you to lie on your back," I whispered.
