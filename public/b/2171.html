The mountains were clear and free, and they were just small hills that stood out from the plain of the valley. For all he knew, she must be at least a mile away from that road. He wondered if maybe he had to try driving up there. He was beginning to feel frustrated with himself for having such a strong impression of a human being.</p> <p>Carson drove the long gravel road slowly, thinking back to the time that he had left his farm. All his life he had walked with two hands - one to keep his mind from the bad things that people did to him as they drove by, and then the other to get out of those big houses where he had lived for so long, not knowing what the consequences would be. So many people got hurt after he lost one of the most important friends in his life.</p> <p>He wondered if his own feelings had really been that simple. He didn't know any of the words to describe his feelings that day. That moment of discovery was something of a revelation for him, and he had learned to be grateful for his circumstances that day.</p> <p>"What do you think?" he asked.</p> <p>"I think you're right," said a voice from the driver's seat, "but what are you saying?"</p> <p>"Just tell me," said Carson thoughtfully. "Maybe it's all I need to know."</p> <p>"I'm asking you to drive up for awhile," she said smiling.</p> <p>Carson was not surprised when she smiled at him as she leaned over and opened the driver's side door. Taking his hand she helped him out of the car and walked him around to the back of the house. She sat down on the patio as he got the luggage out of the trunk.</p> <p>"I'm glad you came to stay with me, Carson," she said. "Come hang out for a bit, will you?"</p> <p>"I'll always be here for you, Miriam," he replied. "I think I'm better for it."</p> <p>He heard her chuckle softly before stepping back over toward the house with him. He tried not to look at her as closely as he knew she would, but at what appeared on her face when she saw what was hanging on the side of the house behind them.</p> <p>"What's all that? It's pretty thin up there, isn't it?" she asked.</p> <p>"It is, Miriam," he replied. "My hands are full."</p> <p>"It's alright. No one else is going to touch it," she smiled. "I suppose you don't mind at all?"</p> <p>"That's alright. I like that you're not going to have something to cover up with, Miriam," he smiled as he said it.</p> <p>"Mmm-hmm," Miriam agreed. "I am all skin and bone. And you must be just as stiff around the middle."</p> <p>"I guess I'm a little, uh, short for Carson," he said. "So you say your name's Miriam," he added. "Where is it?"</p> <p>"In the front yard."</p> <p>For that moment, Carson thought that he should take a quick look and see how Miriam liked his appearance. It would be kind of nice if Carson was the only one that knew that she liked him. Carson decided not to ask what it was that Miriam liked, though.</p> <p>"Do you like me? Is it what I think?" asked Miriam. "Can, you come over to the back with me, Carson?"</p> <p>"Yes, dear, please do," Carson replied. "I don't mind, actually."</p> <p>"I know it's not right," Miriam said, "but I hope you like yourself,"</p> <p>"I really do. And I was right in the middle of talking to you."</p> <p>"There you go," Miriam said. "Maybe you can talk to me a bit more now."</p> <p>Carson started to pull his suitcase out of the trunk when Miriam stopped him.</p> <p>"Do you remember what you said?" she asked.</p> <p>"Yes," he replied. "I mean it."</p> <p>"Yes, I remember," said Miriam. "Do you want me to show you around or just help you pick a place for lunch?"</p> <p>Carson wasn't sure how to respond, so he sat back and leaned against the trunk of the car. Miriam knelt down next to him and lifted up and down his leg until it seemed that she was just a foot away from his crotch.</p> <p>"I know a great place," she said quietly. She looked up at him over the rim of her glass and slowly stood up, pullingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
