Her nipples were thick and pointy. Her breathing began to change and she let out a small whimper as a wave of her pleasure flooded through her body. I reached between our bodies and placed my hand on her right breast, my thumb just barely touching her nipple.</p> <p>She let out a sigh and then I felt myself getting aroused again. I watched as she brought her hand down to the top of my hip and started to rub herself into my ass. She continued to rub the tip of my cock as our hips moved against one another in unison.</p> <p>My cock was a bit larger than her husband's, but not as wide as the one in Heathers when it was stiff, but I don't know what came over Heather.</p> <p>My hand rubbed her breast up and down as her hips pushed harder into me as her pace quickened. I looked down at her as I watched my hand slide from her hip, up and down her thighs toward her pussy.</p> <p>"Is my friend getting hot?" I heard her say, "is it getting you hard?"</p> <p>Her hands were grabbing my cock as she was massaging the head. I smiled at her as her finger and thumb wrapped around the shaft, moving the shaft in a quick circle. The two fingers she held onto the head were now pumping her pussy as her hips ground back and forth on my ass.</p> <p>Her face tensed as her climax came. She took her hand away from my cock and placed it around it as she ground towards me. I looked back at her from where I was still seated on her sofa chair, watching her legs tense as she came. I could feel my own orgasm building in my groin again. I watched her face as she squeezed the cock and balls as she came.</p> <p>"I think it's time for me to go," I said as I got up from her chair. I kissed her lips as I pulled the bottom of my shirt out from under me. "Let me see your panties." I said.</p> <p>She reached up and undid my bra, pulling it off while she did. Her fingers grazed the silk covering my breasts as she held my right breast, pinching the nipple. She pulled the silk away from my pussy as she pulled her fingers from my breasts and ran her hands up my body, pulling the panties off my hips. She put her hands on each cheek of my ass and pulled me back into her, my legs hanging over the arms of the chair, my lips parted.</p> <p>I was ready to fuck again.</p> <p>"Take your clothes off," I said as she stood there. She pulled her clothes off, kicking the skirt off over her shoulders. She was wearing a bra and garter belt, but it covered little. "You look so damn good," I said. I stepped forward and slipped my hand into her g-string. The crotch of it was soaking wet with her juices and my spit.</p> <p>"You like?" I teased her.</p> <p>"Yes," she said, "really really." She moved closer to me as she stood on her tiptoes, her breasts pressed against me. I felt one of her fingers slide between my pussy lips and into my body. She moved her finger inside me as her lips found mine. Our bodies writhed against one another. "Yes," her tongue probed my mouth.</p> <p>I ran my fingers over the back of her neck. I could feel her softness against my chest, my nipples pressing hard against her back. She moved her hands down and pushed her breasts against my chest as her finger moved in and out of my body. I grabbed her shoulder with one hand while I held her by the hips with the other. We stood there as she slipped her fingers from my body. As I held her by her hips, the silk of her g-string sliding against my finger as it passed between her inner lips.</p> <p>"You feel very good," I said, "my hands are wet too." I stepped back as I kissed her cheek. Her hand reached up and ran through my hair as she kissed me. I had to have her.</p> <p>I took off my t-shirt, followed by my bra, still holding my breasts as I went to her and lifted her off the chair. I took her in my arm and we walked back toward her room. Once inside with the door wide open, we embraced as we both looked down at my naked body. I stepped back out of my panties, and stood in front of her. "I want to do that to you," I said. "I want to hold you and make love to you."</p> <p>She knelt before me, her eyes looking down at my naked body as she ran her hands over my hips, feeling my ass through my panties.
