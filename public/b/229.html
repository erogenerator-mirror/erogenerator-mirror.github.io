I could hear our happy moans and cries echoing across the open patio doors. My body was aching for release. I began by massaging my clit with my fingers. Then I reached down and slid a finger over my wet slit. I could feel my body quivering with desire. I pushed my hand slowly inside. Then I slid another finger in, and began to fuck myself with three in unison. I began to rub my clit faster and I could feel myself begin to build up to the orgasm.</p> <p>Then I felt someone touch my ass. It was my boyfriend, he knew what I thought should happen so he quickly brought my cheeks to his mouth. He began to run his tongue all over both cheeks. I could feel him sucking them like there was no tomorrow and it made me tingle all over. Then he placed his face right inside of my ass. He began to lick, suck, and nibble my anus. Oh my god I couldn't hold back anymore. I felt my body tensed up. Then my body began to quiver. Then I heard myself scream! I let go of my body and let myself experience orgasm number one!</p> <p>By the sound of it I would not have believed it, but I was one of those girls who could cum all over their boyfriend without breaking the speed limit. He was in me, licking me to another orgasm. After that I began to think that I would never make another boyfriend of him, well, he was too good with his cock for that. I would never go without a boyfriend again!</p> <p>The whole afternoon was an experience of learning and enjoying the sex without commitment. Even after I fell into a deep state of contentment. I didn't want to talk about it but it seems like the only thing I had to do was look at him! I couldn't believe that I really felt he had no real feelings for me, he just wanted me like I really was him! For the first time I felt really happy about what we had done. What could have possibly been so wrong?</p> <p>One thing I didn't think about was my sex life. I was the only woman in the house and the only one I had wanted for some time. The only guy I had sex with in the house. If I had some time to think about it, I would have thought it was really me. So I left the room. I did think about calling him and getting back to him. But he had the hots for me but could never make a move on me. I just sat on my bed and thought I might as well tell him now. Then he called me.</p> <p>"Hi honey,"</p> <p>"I'm sorry to disturb you, it's me, I was hoping to tell you how much I love you."</p> <p>"I know, I can hear the whole thing, I missed the whole thing too!"</p> <p>"Well, I think I am going to need some time to be with you."</p> <p>"Well it's been a long time, I feel kind of bad about talking to you about that, that's why I was so afraid to talk to you because I didn't feel ready for any sort of relationship with you."</p> <p>"You mean you really wanted to see me?"</p> <p>"Yes,"</p> <p>"Please do, I would like to see you again in a few months. I really missed talking to you that summer because of the way you moved so smoothly, and I just couldn't stop thinking about you."</p> <p>"I am not sure I could be a better boyfriend, I hope you don't mind."</p> <p>"No of course not, I would love to be with you like I miss you so terribly," and then we knew what was wrong with us. We decided then to forget about him and to move on with our lives. I knew that I might even fall on my ass, I wouldn't be able to face me alone for the rest of my life with a man like he could have anyone. I was ready!</p> <p>I had another boyfriend when we graduated from high school, and even though we had grown accustomed to each other, we kept falling over each other until we got to the point of no return. However, we had never discussed our relationship again, well I should have thought of that. We still kept fighting but had pretty much decided that it was between us. I never asked him anything that had happened in his life, but there were some things that I wanted to say.</p> <p>One day, we were having a date. We were at the house and I just didn't want to let him go after some stupid thing happened, we had been dating about a month and I saw a bulge in his pants. I thought I just heard him moan as he took out a magazine from his suit and looked inside. What I saw was pretty strange.
