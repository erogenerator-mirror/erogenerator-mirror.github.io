I have a question for you now, though? Do you know what I want? Would you like for me to suck your cock? Do you want to come over and do just that?"</p> <p>I knew what I was talking about. "Nooo," I gasped, "not this."</p> <p>"No. I want to suck your cock," she repeated.</p> <p>"But," I protested, as if it were a small and difficult task, "if I have you by your cock again like this it won't be a problem."</p> <p>"It won't be a problem. Do what you want to do," she purred as she sucked my cock in her mouth. This was beyond sex talk. And beyond her usual, non-sexual, flirting. I was just about to pop. "Oooooh yeah," I moaned.</p> <p>She gave me this weird look. As she sucked me off, my hand went up so I could push my cock further in her throat. "Awww," she said, "that's it. Awwwwww yeah. Mmmmm." Then she went back to sucking me. "Just a little more," she purred. "Good. I like that," she purred again.</p> <p>With that, she released my cock and took her fingers and stroked my cock with a practiced touch. Then she took both of my testicles in her other hand and sucked slowly while looking at me in the eye with a knowing look. There was no doubt that she wanted me as badly as I wanted her. "Mmmmm. You always knew how to make me feel good. Mmmm. I really like that."</p> <p>This wasn't the kind of language she uses when she's going to suck my cock. This time it was a little different. It was a little more demanding, and more like a "please," like "oh, fuck, please don't stop." She didn't say to cum; she just kept sucking me and licking me and stroking me until I was squirming in ecstasy before she finally released me. I was panting a little, but this was only the first taste of what she tasted like. She wiped some of the saliva from her mouth and made up her mind.</p> <p>She released me just a little and said "Your turn now."</p> <p>She stood up, took my hand and led me over to the bed. She then lay down, and I kneeled down. She turned over to watch me and then I kneeled there. She started to stroke herself again, and watched me watching her. I could watch the entire scene through the bars through the bars. The room smelled faintly of sex, and the bed was getting soaked in a way I had never been before. All I could think about was what she must look like naked, lying there, waiting for me to do it. She made no sign of disobeying anymore. Instead she looked down at me, a little uncertainly as she did so, staring at me with that same look. "Kneel," she said, and I did what I had been doing so far that day. "Your turn to suck that lovely cock of mine," and she got up onto all fours. She was wet, and her scent got me all the rest of the way. I got up behind her and started to lick the length of her pussy while working my way up to the entrance. There was a slight sting in my tongue from the way she moaned, but I didn't try to do anything. She made no move against me whatsoever. We were just two different things to play with. I knew she was turned on, and it was only natural. She didn't seem to be a bad slave either, in fact she seemed to enjoy being used. But I think the fact that she is mine was enough to put me in control, that's for sure. I could hear her breathing quicken as well as her body start to tremble slightly a little with excitement, and she was going to climax pretty fast. I put my hands under her right leg and grabbed her ass as I went in for the kill, and she let out a little cry.</p> <p>"Fuck!" she screamed, and then she let go of a little of the spongy surface of her breast. And I did. I went in for the kill, kissing her all over her back and the back of her neck. "Fuck me hard," she said, "harder." I don't mean to hurt her, but she wasn't used to it, and she made a few more comments, such as, "fuck harder, fuck faster," etc. But I don't think she was in any physical pain any of those things mean much to her. Not really, and it showed. "Fuck this guy!" she shouted a second before she started climaxing. Her body shuddered and went limpâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
