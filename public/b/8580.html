It's probably one of the better experiences of our lives, after all. My girlfriend was so nice - not as nice as you are - but nice. She was smart, cute, was fun to be with and I felt like I could be her one-night stand again. And, honestly.</p> <p>I had met Tracey - a lovely young lady I liked, but also not quite like I usually fell short. And she was still living at home (I've been staying over more often) and working as a manager in one of the bigger factories downtown. I knew that we could do it. That's all I had left.</p> <p>But this weekend was different.</p> <p>As was the other night with Tracey and Julie. We did all kinds of things that were a little extreme before - well, the first 3 or 4 times - but tonight, we had something special. Julie and Tracey wanted to dress sexier and more provocative than usual, and I think we went a little overboard a little - I don't know what they were talking about – but Tracey and I were both quite happy and a little nervous about the whole thing, so Tracey suggested we put on some sexy outfits. Tracey and Julie both wanted to wear the sexy outfits (and the shoes) we had in the first place, but my girlfriend wanted hers to be just for the occasion. I had a girlfriend who I felt like I was going to kiss, but Tracey and Julie were both a little more assertive, and I wasn't sure that Tracey and Julie really would be up to it.</p> <p>I started walking into the bedroom together, and was glad that I hadn't worn underwear. I pulled off the last vestige of my clothes, threw on the pink bra and thong that was the only article of clothing I had left. I could feel myself getting excited as I got undressed, getting a sense of excitement in my body that I hadn't felt in a long time. I had gotten in front of my computer on the couch, and while sitting there I started looking through the pages on my browser. Just looking at the photos had turned me on beyond belief. Julie and Tracey were completely nude. I sat and masturbated in the chair as I slowly stared at the pictures. I had to take one of them - a picture of Tracey as a little boy, sitting on the couch with a box of ice cubes - and I did so. I did it so that my hand would not fall to my lap, but I left it there and imagined that I was jerking off in front of my best friend.</p> <p>I saw the image on my computer change, and I wondered why Tracey and Julie had taken to seeing me as anything other than the girl they sometimes hung out with. "What did Tracey tell you?" I wondered. But as a matter of no consequence, it didn't seem important that I did what I did. But I continued watching the others - Julie and Tracey - as I started trying to guess what I would see or maybe what I might see when I went to see Tracey and Julie later for our night out.</p> <p>Julie and Tracey were really out of it - they had been so caught up in the moment, that it didn't help that Tracey had started stroking my cock when I got up to go and got myself off in the bathroom. They were so excited I was sure of it. And then Tracey started kissing Julie. It was a sexy moment for both of them, and I imagined a threesome as both of them fingered each other so very softly for the first time in about six months.</p> <p>I was mesmerized as I watched Tracey and Julie go at it. A few seconds afterwards I realized what a hot sight that was, and I quickly found myself getting an erection. All my inhibitions were gone as I felt my erection getting harder and harder. In my excitement I was starting to feel slightly guilty.</p> <p>Finally they came up for air and looked at each other.</p> <p>"You've got one of the hottest women I've ever been with..." said Tracey. "And you sure are my hot little fuck slut."</p> <p>I was in shock: "But you're my girlfriend." I managed.</p> <p>"Mmm, yes, you're my girlfriend" said Julie—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
