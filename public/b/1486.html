He wanted to cum.</p> <p>He couldn't believe that two gorgeous women were so in the throes of passion with him and could get off with him. His hips started twitching and moving slightly but he didn't care, it started out slow and built with passion in between, like a good sign as it would give him this feeling for a long time. His head dropped back down on the desk as his hips moved on their own to meet theirs faster.</p> <p>The woman was lying down with one leg up on his thigh, her free hand was lightly stroking her clit and sliding in and out. She made a noise that made his head spin, as if she were getting closer with every stroke and could go on forever. She seemed to be getting closer and he could feel the juices start to be flowing. He could also feel himself starting to get close to orgasm as he stared at the woman's face.</p> <p>He leaned forward with his eyes still connected, he pulled my skirt up.</p> <p>When the woman got a look at me, he started to lean over her, when she started to move and said, "Oh god, I'm going to cum."</p> <p>He leaned down as well and kissed her, then pulled her up towards him. She wrapped her arms around his neck, and he couldn't resist pulling her towards him faster and deeper.</p> <p>She started to shake and start to kiss his neck while he kissed her. He kissed her lower lip and moved his mouth down to her chin. He licked and bit her chin and then moved his tongue between them. She moaned as he did, that drove him crazier and faster. He was in heaven and had a great feeling that he had never felt before.</p> <p>"Oh god, oh god" she moaned as her lips parted, she gasped as he put those nipples in his mouth and sucked on them.</p> <p>After a little while, he pulled her up from the desk.</p> <p>"You wanna fuck me?" he asked.</p> <p>"That is one thing I have always wanted to do," she said grinning.</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>"And now I have."</p> <p>He lay down on the desk on his back with his legs spread wide.</p> <p>"You want me like this?" she asked smiling.</p> <p>"Yes, that is exactly what I want," he responded.</p> <p>The woman straddled him with one leg, her hands still between them on the desk, keeping his penis deep inside. He moved one hand up to her shoulder and caressed it, rubbing it over her hair.</p> <p>"It's hard again," she said with a smile.</p> <p>"Oh it is," he replied.</p> <p>She then started to rock against his penis. Her hands never left his shoulders as she pushed her hips up with her hands. They slid up and down, he could feel each motion of her fingers. The movement of her hands took on an erotic motion she was not ready for.</p> <p>"This is not what I expected," she said.</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"I have never done this before."</p> <p>"It's okay, I'm sure you've never done it before."</p> <p>"Then, just put your dick in."</p> <p>"But, do I have to fuck you?"</p> <p>She started to make it sound as if she was not sure that this was the right thing to do.</p> <p>"No, but you will like it and enjoy it," he replied.</p> <p>"Then, please fuck me," she said again with a grin.</p> <p>She climbed off of him, grabbed his dick and straddled his hips, keeping it hard, moving forward. She put her arms on top of his head, pulling him in between her knees. She sat astride of him with the tip of the dildo in her pussy. It felt like he was hard and she knew he had a good sized, thick dick, maybe seven inches. The woman began to rock against his dick again, she didn't care how it felt or where it was, all she wanted to do was cum. Her head fell back and he held it still as she moved up and down on it.</p> <p>His hips moved with her, his dick would move in and out of her, the dildo rubbing her clit with every move. Then she would grind herself around his dick. The sensation was amazing, his penis was like a little cock inside of her, but when she would get used to what he was doing it wouldn't move. She could feel his cock get harder and bigger with each motion she made and it was all she had to do to get him to fuck her. Then she pulled it out of her and got down on her knees.</p> <p>"Do it," she said again.</p> <p>He could see her face as she movedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
