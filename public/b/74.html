I mean I’m really sorry but all men are just pigs and have to have their fun without thinking!” I explained.</p> <p>“I know but it doesn’t matter to me!” he said.</p> <p>“But don’t think I can get the little cunt of yours to go and do your fucking bidding!” I said.</p> <p>“You really don’t need to say that.” John said pulling onto the road.</p> <p>“If it gets to be your baby then its yours to have!”</p> <p>“Fuck you!”</p> <p>John pulled off about six kilometres to the end of the road and then turned off on a hill with the main road.</p> <p>It was the last place I was going to live. John had promised me a small house and I guess I deserved it. I could have a good job and my friends at home would like me. I could go to work on my day off after paying off the job as there was only one other one I would work on anyway. We would get a couple of days off together when I was at work. So it was great.</p> <p>We both came out of the house in the same clothes of his. John was wearing a t-shirt. He must have been really looking at his reflection in the mirror because he looked as good as him. And I was looking at him in a different way. He was still naked and I took off the rest of my clothes. So he took me back to my place. We kissed like that with our tongues probing each other’s mouth. His hands were roaming all over my body. He must have taken me to bed.</p> <p>This time he fucked me in my bed. Not as hard a time as I thought it would be but definitely much better. We fucked again until about three and then finally we were finished.</p> <p>I was very sore for the next three days. In the first week alone I couldn’t sleep. John and his family all went to see some of their friends, all in uniform I presume. By the start of the second week I looked at myself, I could barely move. My breasts were hurting so much I stopped trying to get any help from girls my age. For the rest of the week I was a complete wreck. All my clothing on show except for the bra and panties I was still wearing. All the while I was constantly thinking of having a cock in me. My pussy was sore but there was nothing to do but let it loose some more. Just like before I was hoping John had enjoyed himself immensely. Perhaps he would then return again.</p> <p>The next week all the time my husband didn’t know about my ‘attitude’ in bed. I suppose he also felt guilty knowing that John and his family were still having sex with other partners and that he didn’t think twice about showing his body off all over again.</p> <p>He was just fine keeping me like that for two weeks. He also spent so much time at the gym he didn’t have to get out at the other end of town and he could walk around without clothes. All during the day all he had to do was look at the girls. He still looked pretty hot.</p> <p>I had also been getting quite a thrill to see him dressed almost the whole time. It was not just the outfit but the whole thing was really turning me on. Every time he walked over to see me all I could think or say was how wonderful he would make me feel.</p> <p>John started buying for me some clothes. Not very sexy ones, but they were really sexy, and not very short. But they kept coming. He had bought my first pair of underwear for me. At the start of the third week John got me one of the thongs. After that I went to get the others.</p> <p>“I don’t think I will be wearing these!” I thought.</p> <p>I couldn’t get the image of John in this underwear out of my head.</p> <p>The third and final week I had bought a couple of other new clothes. A new blouse with a plunging neckline and a pair of really high-cut pants.</p> <p>After that John bought a couple of suit jackets and some fancy footwear.</p> <p>After the third week John bought me a couple of new pants and a suit jacket. I had never worn this before.</p> <p>Before I knew it John’s plane flew off into the sea again in one of those long semi-combed ones you saw in those old movies.</p> <p>The second week was almost over with. John got me one of those pairs of trousers that are like a pair of slacks at the end of a trousers legs but have a more wide strap that slides inside your trousers leg into the crotch.
