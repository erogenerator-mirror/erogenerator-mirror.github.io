"It's okay. I got to go." I stood up. "I'll talk to you later. Bye." I turned around.</p> <p>When I got to my car, however, I noticed that I was just a few feet from her. I just stared. She looked into my dark eyes, not sure if I had noticed her looking. "I'm sorry," I said.</p> <p>I just stared. She just stared at me. I just stared back. My cock had grown a little in my lap once more.</p> <p>***</p> <p>For the next week or so, I sat and watched as we spoke casually, mostly in the backseat, talking to each other, or talking on my phone through the night or day. One Friday, however, I got a text from her. It was from the same number as the one we'd exchanged, that night, about three weeks ago. She answered it. We said, "I have to go," as we walked to her car in silence. She started walking back, and before she got to the car, we said, "I am sorry."</p> <p>"No," I said. "It's no. I understand. It's just that, well, you seem so much like me lately. It just seems more and more out of date for you."</p> <p>"I guess," she replied. "I'm not the best at dating. You don't have to be any older, if you want to be. And I'm not saying that this is your first date."</p> <p>I had the urge to roll my eyes. And then I realized that there was nothing wrong with watching her. It was probably for the best that she wanted to go out this Friday, so that when her car arrived it was my turn to talk.</p> <p>"You know how awkward it is." I tried not to let how she'd acted show; actually, I felt a little uncomfortable about saying it just because she'd felt awkward.</p> <p>"Oh, I know," she replied quietly, her gaze never leaving my gaze. "I just can't seem to get the nervousness out of my voice. I feel like a girl. It's scary. It's like I've been afraid of what I might do if I got drunk or something."</p> <p>As we crossed the street, I felt my face blush. This girl was a girl, of all people. I knew that she probably didn't look her age, too, but what woman couldn't, when you know you're not a teenager, but in this dark city, where teenagers were usually less and less popular. We were now out in public, in a parking lot. She looked at her phone. "Can I see you again tonight?" she asked, as she leaned over and touched my cheek. I smiled and shook my head. "I'm sorry?"</p> <p>"Yeah," I replied. "Just a little nervous." I reached out my hand and she took it.</p> <p>"Oh," she said. "That's sweet. I'll probably be back on Sunday, though, with more wine. Maybe we can hang out after all."</p> <p>A week later, I got a text. "I just called you."</p> <p>"I'm sorry," she said.</p> <p>"I want you to know that I'm really very much nervous," I said, knowing what was about to happen.</p> <p>"Oh. Well....yeah, I guess so."</p> <p>I started to open my mouth, to say "really" or some other witty retort, but she spoke first. "I said, I thought you were really nervous."</p> <p>"Why?"</p> <p>"I'm really not sure how to describe how much. You look so fucking hot."</p> <p>"What do you fancy tonight?" I asked.</p> <p>'Well, this is definitely it," she said. "We're going to this fancy club I know. They have a great dance floor and the music is sexy. Do you want to go?"</p> <p>"I'd love to have your body around," I replied. "But I'm not a kid."</p> <p>"Why don't you come on. I'll drive you," I blurted.</p> <p>"That sounds great. I'll come with you," she replied as she put the phone down and went to open the door.</p> <p>"Well then," I said, as I opened the door for her, "I should take you home before I put it off."</p> <p>"Not a good idea," she replied. "I don't think you'd understand."</p> <p>"You don't have to do anything." I leaned over to kiss her. "What's your name?"</p> <p>"Oh, it's Sarah."</p> <p>"Are you Sarah?"</p> <p>"Yeahâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
