He lifted his head gently to kiss me, his finger tracing circles across my belly and teasing my clitoris to full effect. "Oh my god..."</p> <p>"You like that?"</p> <p>"It feels so good. I'll be you again in a minute." I smiled at my son. "Are you still there?"</p> <p>Paul looked up with his blue eyes as I lay down. He kissed me lightly and then lowered his head to kiss down my stomach toward my center.</p> <p>"Oh, baby. I'm so close. Please..."</p> <p>"Oh Paul, we have the whole weekend ahead of us and we won't have to wait any longer." I smiled at him. Paul then kissed his way up to my breasts and continued his seduction.</p> <p>"Omigod, Mom, you're so soft, and so warm." Paul kissed all around my areola, gently biting and pulling with his lips. My nipples were standing out like tiny little pencil erasers. Paul kissed them and gently pulled them back to expose my areola and I was in utter bliss.</p> <p>"You've done this before, you know, before we had these."</p> <p>Paul moved his face toward my nipple. His tongue caressed my sensitive skin and I was almost instantly aroused.</p> <p>"Mom, I'm going to do the same thing to you." I told him.</p> <p>His tongue licked a slow circular motion along the edges of my nipple, each time going further I could feel the tingling of excitement in my belly. His tongue swirled around the hard bud. It had never been done before. It didn't take long for me to feel pressure building inside of me that had nothing to do with anything; rather it was just a feeling of pleasure. I could even feel the tinglings of impending orgasm begin to build again.</p> <p>"Uck." I was almost screaming now as my son's tongue made me feel like I was going to explode. The tingling inside of me intensified, the need became the need, the tingling increased. At the same time I felt the intense orgasm that had been building for all these days start to come on. The tingling sensation became a pressure deep inside of me building to a massive orgasmic precipice, my body tingled too from the tension the buildup.</p> <p>Paul pulled his mouth away, looked up at me. My eyes were wide with wonder. My heart pounded as my mouth fell open in ecstasy and I moaned, "Ohhh, Paul." His eyes twinkled with delight and he smiled as he placed his strong arms atop my knees, giving his head an angle to kiss my breasts. I opened my arms to him, giving him access to all of me. Paul kissed all over my breasts and stomach, making sure he avoided any contact with my clitoris, lips, or nipples. He was a lover and I was still coming.</p> <p>"That felt so good, Mom." Paul whispered in my ear. My lips were so tight, I just couldn't talk.</p> <p>"Yes, baby, it did. I've dreamed of that moment." I kissed him softly. "Please, please finish what you were doing." I felt as though my orgasm would be finished. "Oh, baby. Stop."</p> <p>I couldn't breathe at all, I was completely spent. There were tears in my eyes and I was so wet. My legs were shaking as my son carefully slipped off of me. As he knelt between my legs, my pussy was throbbing to be touched. Paul looked up at my flushed face. "My love, I have dreamed about touching you again." Paul's face was serious.</p> <p>"You mean it? You dreamed about touching me again?"</p> <p>Paul nodded. "Yes. I've wanted to do that for a long time."</p> <p>"Do I turn you on, baby?" Paul asked.</p> <p>I smiled at him. "Of course. I'm yours now, my love. I love you."</p> <p>Paul looked surprised. But still surprised. "Is this okay, Mom?"</p> <p>I was smiling at my boy. His look made me feel special. I loved being with him. Our love was strong, passionate, and powerful, the bond, like the bond between a mother and her child, would last forever. It was time we shared the same bond, a mother's love, an intimate bond between family and parent-child sex. It felt special and right.</p> <p>"It's a wonderful feeling, honey. And you're going to learn, and understand, as you will become. You will love your mother, love what you heard on the phone, and accept what you understand to be okay." I knew I was right.</p> <p>Paul leaned down and kissed my face.
