I asked. "Maybe the boys in the club should be willing if you need them to."</p> <p>I felt her blush deeply and looked away.</p> <p>"Well, if they really don't want to stay here, they could have another party on the beach when they get home."</p> <p>"Doing something with them might be hard," I said.</p> <p>She looked uncomfortable. I wanted to ask her what she was thinking and I wanted to talk with her. I leaned in and whispered in her ear "I've always wondered what it would be like with another man. I just wanted to know. Do you think it will be awkward?"</p> <p>"Maybe a little," she responded. "But I think it will be fun."</p> <p>After another ten minutes or so, I looked at her again.</p> <p>She had that same wide-eyed surprise on her face. She seemed a little scared but didn't protest.</p> <p>"Are you sure," I asked. "Do you want them here with you, or if you feel uncomfortable?"</p> <p>"Do I want them here with me?" she said, a little confused.</p> <p>"Yes," I said "I think we should move back to the bedroom for a moment."</p> <p>My wife quickly rose from the sand and began walking slowly back into the house. Her nipples were aching in the bikini tops and she was so wet and aroused on the beach. Her ass looked as lovely as it always did. She was still feeling the need and need to get back home without the boys and she wasn't about to let me do it.</p> <p>I quickly walked back into the bedroom just as she was coming back toward the bed. I gently laid her gently on her back on the bed so she was flat on her back and her legs were facing outward. She didn't have to say a word she simply leaned back and spread her legs. I dropped my bag, my shorts and swim suit and dove in.</p> <p>I immediately started on her pussy. I had thought about this since the time we first met at the club at her urging. She was neatly trimmed and I could easily see her clit peeking out as I moved my fingers around her entrance. I could see her lips open and a little trickle of nectar running down between her inner lips. God she looked so sexy and wet. I leaned down and gave her a wet kiss and gently ran my tongue along her lips. She tasted salty and slightly earthy.</p> <p>We kissed passionately as my hands gently stroked her body. I opened her legs wide and took my tongue and slowly ran it from her ass hole to her clit, making her hips jump as my tongue made contact. It was as if my pussy was a magnet holding her pussy lips open and as if her clit was an ice cream cone that slid across the surface of her clit without stopping. Her whole body shuddered and jiggled with the energy from her body to mine. Each time my tongue slipped over her clit, she began to moan and push up into my mouth.</p> <p>My tongue was all over her but concentrated on her hooded little button as my thumb lightly touched her clit. It made her body jump again as it made her cum again. I gently pressed my index finger in, wet it again and pressed a little at the opening to her canal. Just as she started to cum again, my finger went back to her clit as my saliva wet finger was gently stroked around her opening from one end to the other.</p> <p>That was enough, she said firmly as she began pushing hard against my mouth. I was in the middle of her when my tongue made an instant movement to her clit. She exploded and moaned loudly as the first wave of cum hit the back of my throat. I quickly swallowed the second load but I still had to force myself to take in the taste.</p> <p>I lay beside her and put my hand on her stomach. I could feel her heart racing as she was still trying to catch her breath. I lifted her onto my fingers so that she could lie on and I looked over at her face when she realized what I was doing. She turned to me and said "You are a mess. Where were we?"</p> <p>"Lie down," I said as I pulled her to me. She immediately lay on her stomach. When she did, I slid my shorts off and straddled her. I pulled her bikini bottom off and then slid her body completely over mine. I put my mouth down on hers, opened my mouth and just slid the tip of my tongue inside her mouth. She responded in kind by pulling my mouth to hers as well.</p> <p>We just lay there for several minutes kissing as a part of the experience. After a short while, she was breathing heavily and seemed to be really getting into the moment.
