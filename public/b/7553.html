The first thing he saw in the mirror was a gorgeous pair of legs, a little too short, but just as sexy to be called 'high cut stockings', and a short tight body. "Oh man." He was still half-asleep when he heard a knock at the door. He took a deep breath and opened the door. "Come on in."</p> <p>Mitch stood still, a little nervous as he was not prepared to face a stranger in his house. "Hello Mitch," I asked, "have you been here long?"</p> <p>"Uh, yes. Only a moment," he said. "I just got here."</p> <p>Mitch glanced around as he took another drink of wine, "You don't look very good."</p> <p>"Thanks," he said, "and thank you."</p> <p>He had never talked to Mitch before. It was weird that the topic was never the other way around. That he and his friend knew another man was the subject of his fantasies. He never imagined that Mitch could be as gay as he seemed and that maybe he shouldn't be interested in meeting anyone. Mitch wasn't sure if it made him gay, as he knew his body was not the best, even after a lifetime of marriage, but a friendship like Mitch with his man was special.</p> <p>"Do you just stand there looking at me and wondering if you got yourself a room in the hotel?" Mitch asked.</p> <p>Mitch smiled, "Well, I didn't think of it as a hotel," he said shyly. "It's nothing fancy. I'll just go shower first."</p> <p>"Oh, please don't do that," Mitch said, but his smile soon changed to a frown. "It's your first date."</p> <p>Mitch was silent. "I don't want anyone to ask me if I'm gay and I hope not because it makes me feel special. I'm not gay. It's just not the way I thought it would be. It's not the way you seem to want to say it. You're looking better than I had hoped."</p> <p>Mitch laughed, "You're damn right I want to say it."</p> <p>Mitch finished his wine, "Well, I've been looking for you for a long time, especially this weekend." Mitch took another drink, "And I can't help it. I'm not a boy or anything, just someone special you might be seeing," he smiled.</p> <p>"Oh!" Mitch said, "I figured as much. There are a lot more guys out there for that than I think. It's been a while."</p> <p>"No worries," Mitch said. "I thought you might get a free room."</p> <p>"Oh, I've had one before."</p> <p>Mitch was shocked. "No, I mean, you know...what happened last weekend. Last month was great. But, then you just disappeared from my memory and I thought about you every day in bed." Mitch was relieved to see that Mitch had been able to say exactly what he needed, "So what was different," Mitch asked.</p> <p>Mitch put his glass down on the table. "How many guys I've known will admit their sexuality is a part of their brain?" Mitch didn't seem like he knew what being gay was, or that he knew if he asked the right questions, someone from some deep inside of Mitch would think better of telling him.</p> <p>Mitch looked down at another glass of wine, trying to look sincere in his conversation. "Not even most guys?"</p> <p>"Only the ones that I love, and that don't cheat on a boyfriend."</p> <p>Mitch thought for a moment. "Wow. That's a lot of guys." He started his new glass again and finished it off.</p> <p>Mitch sipped his wine. "Do they really have to do this?"</p> <p>Mitch thought for a moment, "Well, yes, but I've been thinking a lot about the first person that has ever met me."</p> <p>Mitch didn't know what to say so he just leaned back against the chair and sipped his wine. They sat in silence for a few moments, then Mitch spoke up, "I guess you're an amazing person, Mitch."</p> <p>Mitch laughed, "I guess you were a pretty good look-at when you met me."</p> <p>Mitch was startled. "No. I mean, after yesterday. I knew you were gay."</p> <p>Mitch leaned in close, "You're kidding?"</p> <p>Mitch laughed, "I think I had figured it. I just didn't think I could be any more comfortable with you."</p> <p>Mitch was a little embarrassed, but he was also really pleased that Mitch liked him. "Really?" he said hopefullyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
