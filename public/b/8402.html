And you just stand there with arms out. You want to be kissed by someone, do you?"</p> <p>I knew what he meant. I would do anything to hold out, but if I did, he'd have to kiss me myself. So without speaking a word, I stood up and leaned in, giving him a kiss on the cheek.</p> <p>"You know why I asked you out, don't you?" I said, holding my hands over my heart.</p> <p>"Yeah, not just any girlfriend but a friend."</p> <p>I smiled and leaned in again.</p> <p>"I've just been with a lot of guys and then there were a lot of girls. They think they're special. I just need to find out what I'm missing."</p> <p>"I suppose that's right, what would it take to make you a happy woman?" He said in a soft but firm voice.</p> <p>"Thank you, for the chance to find me."</p> <p>"Well I hope it helps. I've just been with two girls."</p> <p>"Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realise."</p> <p>"Don't be. I think that's what most people would do, I don't think that they would say a word. Come on, let's hit the dance floor." I led him off the dance floor. We took off, heading back to the bar for drinks, he grabbed a wine, I got a martini, and we moved the bar back. As we walked past another guy, he put his arm round my waist, as we danced, he leaned over and whispered in my ear.</p> <p>"I like being in this party, I can't say this enough." as his hand slid down my hip where he'd been caressing me, his hips had me squirming under his touch.</p> <p>I was getting more and more excited as he carried on, kissing my neck, and nibbling on the skin of my ear.</p> <p>"Come on, you know it's my turn to dance."</p> <p>I took two steps forwards as he held me close, we made for the dance floor. He was holding me close for one slow song, his knee on the seat of my chair, so he couldn't feel my mound against his thigh. I was so nervous for even the first lap dance, I just wanted to hold back my emotions. We moved to the next slow dance, his hand on the inside of my thigh, rubbing me just right. If I took the initiative here, it wouldn't feel as if we were fighting over me. Instead we just started slow dancing, his knee, his hips rubbing against mine, I could feel my nipples hardening inside my dress.</p> <p>His other leg was between mine, his hand rubbing my thigh where his thigh met the inside of my thigh. I could feel his semi-erection and I was feeling my own. Before long, I felt ready to feel him inside me, so I took his hand and moved it from my thigh, over my heart. His finger ran along the inside of my ear, I shivered, so I gently moved his finger back and forth across it. He leaned down and whispered in my ear.</p> <p>"I've never been with a girl before, but you'll get to know all your senses, I promise you I won't try it just for the sake of finding out for yourself, I promise you. We'll get to know about more later."</p> <p>"But, I mean it... it's getting late and we've got to get to the hotel, why don't we go to the bar for a drink."</p> <p>"Well, you'll have the drink and we'll see." He said, putting his arm round my waist.</p> <p>Suddenly he pushed me back and onto the bar. I took his hands and looked around, not having seen anyone else, I looked around quickly, and sure enough that's where I had seen them. They were moving from side to side, as if they were dancing to a fast tune. I found it interesting. He took my hand and put it on his cock, I couldn't believe how hard it felt. He slid his finger into the back of my hand, just inside my palm. He pushed his finger deep into my wrist, and he kissed me on the cheek.</p> <p>"I've never had a girl so wet before, I'm not sure I can go again just yet." I said.</p> <p>"I didn't say you could do it, just that if you want me to, you have to." He answered with a cheeky grin. His finger traced down my chin, he kissed me gently and said as his tongue flickered over my lips, "You can do what you like, we'll see if I can stay with you."</p> <p>I leaned up again and gave him another kiss on his lipsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
