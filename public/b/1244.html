It was my dad. He sat at his desk. His eyes went back to me and his expression changed to one I could only imagine was rage or sadness. I didn't say a word. It was barely half the fury I was feeling at that moment anyway, because I knew how the hell I knew him. But how could I know, I thought to myself as I walked by the door and then turned and ran into my father's arms.</p> <p>He caught me in his arms, and my eyes filled with tears. I was crushed and he didn't let me go. I'm not sure how I was even managing to keep my temper. When he lowered me slowly to the floor, which I thought was almost impertinent, he turned his attention back to the wall I had left, and for the next few minute he just stood there listening to my heart beat. I don't think he noticed that I had been listening.</p> <p>"Katherine," I began softly, just long enough to break the moment. And then we were gone.</p> <p>The next thing I knew, my dad was sitting at the kitchen table. We stood there for a moment, drinking each other's words quietly. I was a little too upset, but he was not upset either. He had made a good show. It felt like that had given his life, or at least my life. He didn't seem to notice, or didn't seem to react to, which was a real relief to me because I had wanted him to know that something was ok.</p> <p>"How are you doing dad?" I asked sitting down at the table and watching him.</p> <p>"Good," he responded with that smile, but it was not enough.</p> <p>"How is that your feeling?" I asked. I looked up toward the ceiling.</p> <p>He frowned a little, "I don't know."</p> <p>"Are you going to tell me?" I asked. I thought my heart seemed to be racing, wondering what the hell I was doing here.</p> <p>"I don't think I can." He said softly.</p> <p>"Don't be ridiculous. I don't know if she is, I guess, because that doesn't bother me."</p> <p>He didn't speak. I got a little surprised; he was going to just tell me that she didn't look like the type, to use the excuse it would give that was the only way to explain it. But when he continued his silence, I thought I could trust him. He might be a big ass, and he wasn't even trying to be one. I think that's how he was.</p> <p>"Let me get this out," I finally said slowly.</p> <p>"No," he said firmly, "You need to get your mind out of the gutter and talk to her."</p> <p>That really shocked me. That I was considering something that was not ok by her, and that I might rather have told her myself, and that I would have tried not to tell her in the first place. And that was kind of the problem. It wasn't even the issue that bothered me. I hadn't really considered my first girlfriend. It was just the fact that it was too much for me to digest, but I thought to myself that I may as well tell her. If it got ugly, then I had done this myself. "How does it just make you feel?" I continued the conversation, just making a little more sense. "I think you are finally getting over your worry about her. She's the sexiest woman that I have ever been with, and I had no idea you were into women."</p> <p>"How come she didn't like my body?" he asked. I could tell he was struggling a little.</p> <p>"She was the one who was not all of that," I said. And then I told him why.</p> <p>He was quiet for a moment or two, and then said a little slower, "So, how was the first date with your ex and what the plans are for the future?"</p> <p>"Not a date," I said after a long pause. "I thought it was like an engagement, or a wedding, or a month for me and just a month for you. And then I stopped, and that was it."</p> <p>"She has the best looking body, doesn't she," he said. And then he said, "Why don't you come back to me so I can tell you how sorry I am."</p> <p>There was no hiding in my face. He had meant his first words like that.</p> <p>"I won't" I smiled, "When I get there, I am sure that she will be ready to forgive me. Besides that doesn't mean I don't want to, you know, fuck her."</p> <p>I didn't know what to say to that, so I just noddedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
