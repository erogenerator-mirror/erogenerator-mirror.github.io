"I don't know why I'm doing this. I've made a good impression on you. But what is my lesson to you?"</p> <p>"I...I have no idea," I answered. "But what am I going to do when my parents are home?"</p> <p>"You won't know until they get home," she said with a sexy smile. "I'll be your teacher, and that's what we are going to do. If you really like it...do you really want to learn it?" she looked down briefly, as a flush appeared. "Is that what you're trying to say?"</p> <p>"Sure," I answered. "I guess."</p> <p>"Good," she said. "Because this is just starting."</p> <p>She kissed me again, but this time she pulled her lips slowly to my ear and, with a small kiss, said, "Let's get dressed. This is not just your weekend."</p> <p>"You're not serious," I said.</p> <p>"No," she said with a mischievous smile. "Why not?" she asked. "I've dreamed for awhile about getting your pants off. And that wouldn't be fair to you, would it?" she asked, turning to me, and looking me in the eye. "I've had enough fantasies about a few days ago about this," she added in an almost sultry tone: "I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I did the first time."</p> <p>"Do you really think you can make any lasting impact?" I asked. "I mean, if I'm going to be fucking your brains out, I'm going to have to think about something else."</p> <p>"This thing between you and me is making me crazy," she said. "I really think you could make it with me right now."</p> <p>"Well, let me make a move," I said. "Can you take off your panties?"</p> <p>"I know," she said.</p> <p>"I can do it," I said.</p> <p>"But you're not going to use your mouth either," she said, pulling her shirt up, revealing her breasts. "You're going to use your tongue."</p> <p>"I'm not going to kiss my brother's cock," I said. "So stop."</p> <p>"Oh, I see," she said. "And so are you," and began the strip tease. Her hand went down her pants and under her skirt, rubbing herself through her panties. "It's been really interesting to watch a girl with a huge cock go down every girl's throat," she said. "But I guess if I'm doing it right it's no problem." I pulled my mouth from her pussy, and sat on the couch with my eyes down and my hands still up.</p> <p>Her body seemed to tremble and shake more violently. Her ass was jiggling almost in motion. Her nipples were jutting out and they puffed up just slightly. Her chest heaved, and she was gasping for breath, as her eyes closed; and her tongue snaked out to touch her lips. "Oh God!" she said, "That's better." And, when my hands didn't move, she reached down to pull my face closer to hers.</p> <p>The kiss was long, and my hands moved to caress her ass, then her thighs, then her mound and her breasts. "God, that was so nice," she said. "Your hands are so wonderful, Josh."</p> <p>She was gasping for air; her nipples were fully engorged with blood, and when I moved my thumb to her clit she was bucking. Her lips parted, her face went hard, and she shook. "That's it," she said. "That's what I can do for you."</p> <p>There is no better place to go to feel the joy of someone orgasming than at that moment, no matter how great it was. "So what're we going to do when we leave? We have time."</p> <p>"Oh, I don't know," she said. "You were asking me about you and I, and now I've got you all to myself and you can't even tell."</p> <p>But at that moment there was no more question than how much I'd enjoyed her sucking my cock. "Let's go put on clothes and go get some dinner," I said. "I'll call your parents and let them know. Do you have a cell phone?"</p> <p>"There are some phones in my room," she said. "And I don't want to be on the phone for the next forty-eight hours."
