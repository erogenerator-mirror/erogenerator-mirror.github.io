You and her are friends."</p> <p>"That's good," John said, hugging his mother tightly. He felt awkward. This had been his own family; the fact that she had known it wasn't any different. He had a strange feeling, and it made him feel weird and awkward as well. This wasn't their first time here. They were friends. They were friends who didn't want to make mistakes and mess up their lives on their own. Maybe they could work their way through them, he realized.</p> <p>"It's great." She hugged him. "We don't have much to do, do you? I really miss coming here."</p> <p>"No, my parents just went to visit," John said, embarrassed.</p> <p>"They left me to go to sleep and didn't say much last night, if you know what I mean," Megan said, with a wistful smile on her face. "After all I've been through and done these past couple days, it's been fun."</p> <p>John's heart thumped against him. He didn't know what could possibly come of this. He looked away. He didn't want to look at the woman he loved, who had known his sister for so long, who had had to endure his unspeakable nightmare.</p> <p>"John?" There was movement from behind him. He felt her lips upon his ear. "Don't you have to be at school?"</p> <p>"No," John shook his head. "My English is not up because that's where it's going. I don't really want to be here."</p> <p>"Well, you can't come here while I'm in class, so be at home, then," Megan instructed.</p> <p>John started to turn around. "But," he said.</p> <p>"No, you can't come without me. Get out," Megan said. "If you want to, I'll stay. You're in my house."</p> <p>John couldn't believe that his own mother wanted him to stay, even after all the drama of last night. She was right. He needed time to think through everything. "I don't want to stay," he told him, pushing out the rest of his body.</p> <p>"That's the idea, you don't. You need to think again and think of good reasons not to," Megan teased. John shook his head, and he couldn't believe how fast he had gone.</p> <p>- - - - - -</p> <p>"Come on, I'm going to get us some food," John called out as he rushed for the kitchen. Megan was cooking and getting things ready, and once inside, she dropped the frying pan and threw on a shirt while they sat with their plates and ate.</p> <p>"We should talk," Megan said.</p> <p>"There's no need for that," John said.</p> <p>"No, it's not," Megan smiled. "You're all mine now."</p> <p>"Are you sure you're okay?" John's mother asked, concerned.</p> <p>"Yes," Megan assured him. "Yes, I'm sure. You don't have to stay and talk about it if you don't want to."</p> <p>"Thank you," John said, taking his own sandwich before sitting down.</p> <p>- - - - - - - - - - -</p> <p>"John," Megan called out, her eyes flashing. He had no idea what came over him. He saw a couple things in his thoughts... something, that he didn't know... something that was wrong and right at the same time.</p> <p>"What is it," Megan asked.</p> <p>"Well," John said, looking over at the woman who was helping him prepare for their date, who looked like an angry kitten. He remembered when she had caught him ogling her legs, and he had wondered how he had gotten there. "Mom's going to be home soon."</p> <p>"I'm sorry," Mom said. "I don't want to put you behind my back."</p> <p>I don't want to put her behind my back. Megan told him without even looking like it. He knew his Mom didn't really like it. But to her it was the biggest hurdle in their marriage. To her, he did love her. But, to his Mom, they were more brother and sister. Megan had decided she liked the difference because of the closeness the two of them felt with each other, and she wanted to keep the same between them.</p> <p>She walked out of the bedroom. It was dark, and it was only the end of their street. John saw that she had on a sweatshirt with a little dark pink bikini top on underneath. She got some towels and lay down on the towels, leaving some of the lotion for them. She got herself some water, sat up, and rubbed her hands together.</p> <p>"John?" she saidâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
