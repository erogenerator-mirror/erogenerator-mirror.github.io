And there are lots of nice things you could do for her, but I had this other woman I really like that. I'm just glad to see you okay." he said sitting next to her. Taking her hand he added "I feel like I want to talk with you and kiss you some more."</p> <p>"Really I was just teasing and didn't mean to."</p> <p>"Oh okay."</p> <p>Katherine was smiling now, but her eyes were slightly worried now. "I do want to talk about kissing again, but I think I deserve it, so if you want to, just give it a try," she said squeezing his hand.</p> <p>"Yeah, I really would, I really would. I mean, I just hope that you wouldn't get upset if I tried to talk to you again."</p> <p>"No, not at all, I appreciate the help you offered her, but I'm not sure that I could handle this."</p> <p>"Okay, I guess that she's going to be all right by then."</p> <p>He looked at her then and saw his own worried face. "Don't worry about it, she looks pretty hot in there."</p> <p>"I don't know, look, if nothing good comes to her I'll call her and she will come down and help me talk to you." Katherine said smiling looking at him.</p> <p>"Oh cool." Ian said as he got up and made a cup of tea to drink and drink some water to take in.</p> <p>"You know, when you were in high school you were always trying to get your teacher to take them back to the real world again." she said smiling.</p> <p>"Yeah I tried, but then I got to thinking back to when I was really into girls and girls were my friends back then."</p> <p>"Really."</p> <p>"Maybe I should do it again some time."</p> <p>"Don't go getting angry just start acting like you don't like girls." he said still worried.</p> <p>"You know you are right." he said grinning.</p> <p>Ian had been trying to get to know his old high school friend more, and she'd been having a lot of conversations about boys, and he was wondering if she was going to do it again?</p> <p>"Oh! You mean with girls, because your friends are more than the ones you know."</p> <p>Oh no the answer came quickly and she was nervous when he said it, but she was laughing with him now.</p> <p>"Are you saying that I wasn't always going to be thinking of you in the right way?" he asked with a grin.</p> <p>"Yes it was the way you saw me then, and even though it wasn't the way you saw me. It was because you couldn't see it yourself. When I was fourteen I used to masturbate thinking about you when I was younger thinking about you."</p> <p>"Really?" he said and she nodded her head. "I had a crush on you too." she said.</p> <p>"Uh-huh." he said again not having to think of anything else. "But I never really thought about you at all in high school," he said finally getting it back in.</p> <p>"Oh," she said as she smiled thinking about him looking at her naked body.</p> <p>"I thought I was going to die when I saw you at camp." he said.</p> <p>"Oh, well what happened next would have been something to take your mind of me in the end." she said smiling looking at him smiling. "So I think we have a deal."</p> <p>"Now you really want to do it again." he said smiling. "Just promise me you haven't lost it, I promise it'll feel good."</p> <p>"Yeah, well, I wouldn't be that enthusiastic if I didn't do it."</p> <p>"You wouldn't."</p> <p>"Oh, no that's not what I meant." she said grinning. "I'd rather that I don't have to tell you that I was doing it and that it meant something." she said looking at him trying to see if it was a joke.</p> <p>"What I meant is that you wouldn't have to think about it either. I'm pretty sure you were having one hell of a time." he said laughing.</p> <p>"I am? This is a whole new you." she said looking at him looking up at her smiling with a small smile.</p> <p>"Are you always like that?"</p> <p>"No, not when I'm with you, but you are such a nice guy." she said as she smiled.</p> <p>"Do you want something to eat?" he asked as Kate had already gone upstairs.</p> <p>"Actually I didn't say that I was hungry," she replied smilingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
