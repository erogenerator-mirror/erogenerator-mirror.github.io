"I'll bet that is a lot for you. Will this do for you?" she asked.</p> <p>He gave a little grunt into her ear and held himself still.</p> <p>"Maybe a little," she said. "I hope it will be more for you."</p> <p>His eyes closed and his face relaxed, he moved slightly until she felt his cockhead touch her outer lips. Again he moved slightly, slipping another inch inside.</p> <p>She was amazed at how tight it was. It felt like he had taken her virgin pussy virginity. She moaned lightly.</p> <p>"Mmm," She said, "that feels so good. It's probably going to feel a lot stronger than when I sucked on it."</p> <p>He let go of her thigh, but still slid into her slowly, then his body relaxed. She felt her entire body loosen and was surprised by his girth.</p> <p>She could barely feel him inside her. She was surprised that she could actually feel him there, as he held himself inside her tight and pulled almost halfway out.</p> <p>She put her hands on his chest and rubbed his torso.</p> <p>"I like that," he said. "It's nice. I love it," He said.</p> <p>He started moving back and forth inside her.</p> <p>"It's nice," she said. "'You like this don't you?' he asked.</p> <p>She felt herself starting to respond, to get tighter around him.</p> <p>"Yeah," she said. "I love it when you're like this, I don't know if I can get this even harder than I have. It feels really good for me, but it doesn't feel that good right now."</p> <p>He kept this up for a short while, her pussy clenching his cock again and again with each movement. She was getting close again. He knew it.</p> <p>"You ready," she said.</p> <p>He nodded.</p> <p>He started moving in and out of her again, and she was moaning in pure pleasure as she felt him fill her completely. He pulled out a little faster, and she started to whimper a little.</p> <p>"Can you feel that?" she asked. "Mmm? Do you like this? My pussy, does it feel good?"</p> <p>He paused and looked into her eyes.</p> <p>"It feels better than I ever imagined," he said. "Just a little different, more slippery. More intense."</p> <p>"Does it make you jealous when I put mine on you?" she asked.</p> <p>"If it does,"</p> <p>She reached back and put her hand on his shoulder.</p> <p>"Does it feel better than what other men's pussies are doing," she said, "and, uh, better,"</p> <p>Her voice was shaky, almost shaky as she spoke. She was trying to say something, but not really sure who was being forced to hear it. She could already feel the build up inside her.</p> <p>"This feel good," he said. "Fucking amazing. Do you like my cock up your pussy?"</p> <p>"Do you want to cum now?" she asked.</p> <p>"Yes," he said, grabbing hold of his balls and moving himself faster inside her. "Yes," he said, lifting his head to look at her face. "Just let it happen. Cum with me. Let it go."</p> <p>He stopped, pulled his cock out a little, and held it, and she felt it pulse.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, I can't stop. I'm sooo close. You need a big release, don't you?" he said.</p> <p>She nodded at him, and as his cum pulsed onto a waiting part of her insides, she came with him.</p> <p>They lay next to each other, catching their breath and staring at each other. He took her hand and led the way to the bedroom.</p> <p>He took her to shower and to bed. He kissed her briefly, and then left her in the guest bathroomâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
