He then pulls me in for a hug and kisses me on the cheek. I can't help but smile as he leads me over towards his truck where I can see what he has in mind.</p> <p>After we are in his truck we leave, walking down the street to the park. As I park the truck, he grabs my hand and pulls me to him. I can't help but feel like my life depends on whether or not I can get a chance to be alone with these two.</p> <p>We walk for a little while around the park. It seems like no time at all for us to get close to the water, and as soon as we get closer, his hand reaches out and rubs across my backside. I'm sooo wet, and my nipples pop out of my bikini top. He rubs me across my thighs and gently pinches each one. It feels sooo good. My hips start to writhe in his lap as his fingers slowly slide between my thighs, and he slips one finger inside me. I start to moan and grind against him. I feel like a little girl, and I want him. My hips are starting to move in his lap as I feel him beginning to get hard inside his pants. He slides his hard length out of his pants, and I can see how ready he is to be inside me. He starts to rub his tip against my pussy lips, my hips arching into his as I beg him. I'm not sure if any of that is possible, but for some reason I'm thinking in that exact moment to my dreams when I suddenly feel his hand wrap around my throat. Just as suddenly as it started I feel his thumb slide into my pussy. I have never felt so full in all my life. I can feel something inside me I haven't had in months, and it starts to ripple over me. I open up and let it go, feeling his body press into mine. His erection was as hard as I've ever felt it, and I have never felt or felt more alive than this moment. He starts to slide his thumb back and forth in my pussy, and I feel his body tensing. He pulls his thumb out, and a glob of sticky wetness falls to the ground, then back in. I feel the spandex pants of a pair of jeans. He slides me up his body with only one hand, and wraps his fingers around his cock. I feel his body shudder and jerk slightly as his hand starts to move up and down on his cock. He doesn't move his fingers very much, just the rhythmic motion of his hand. He begins to move his hand up and down, sliding his fingers back and forth again and again. I start to move my hips in time with his hand, and he pushes one finger inside me, and pumps me with his thumb. After a few minutes of this I can feel his cock swell in his hand, and he takes his hand away from me, gasps as his head goes up, and comes out a large amount of white cum. He looks down at me and smiles.</p> <p>"You were amazing," he says.</p> <p>I am overcome with a kind of happiness I've never felt before. I don't know why, maybe I just felt that way myself. In my mind, I feel that he is someone else, someone who makes me feel like I could give myself to anyone. I feel that I am different from all the guys in a way. I know I'm not, and I don't know if it's because I never thought of myself as being gay, or because I never thought of myself as being bi, or some other reason. I start to run my fingers through the last drops of his cum. I can feel his breath quicken just a little as I do. I let go of his hand and put my fingers around his mouth, then kiss him softly.</p> <p>"I love you," I say.</p> <p>"I love you too," he repliesâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
