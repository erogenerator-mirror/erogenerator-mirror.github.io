They both had hard-ons. It struck me as odd. As I watched the tape, I noticed that neither of them moved. Finally, the tape ended. I could feel my dick hardening again. I quickly moved myself over to my wife, and she slowly moved her hand to my hard dick.</p> <p>"My god baby, it feels like you have been asleep for hours." I looked over to see she had slipped her hand down beneath her panties. "Shit!" I said looking at them. "It's getting bigger than life."</p> <p>"Do you want it?" my wife asked. "I'll do it for you, but not to you. Just because you made her do that, I want to watch you fuck another man. Maybe even your uncle. I would love to watch that!"</p> <p>"I don't want to watch anybody else." I said, trying to convince her that we should do it. "I'm not sure I'd do that."</p> <p>"I know, baby, but I don't care. It might be exciting, but not too much. I want to watch a man fuck another woman."</p> <p>"You can suck him if you want to." I said, still trying to convince her. "But not that way. He might be too big, you just might not like it." She was right. What she did to me in that room was way too obscene. She was still talking to the guy on the other end.</p> <p>Finally, I gave up. She could probably have said something with just her finger or her mouth. It took all the effort I had to not cum. My wife pulled herself closer to me, and I could feel her tongue rubbing her upper lip. She pushed the rest of her tongue between my lips, causing me to taste my semen. She then took my half-hard dick into her mouth.</p> <p>By now, we were both fully erect again. My wife pushed my face closer to her pussy. I reached over and started working her panties off. She was so wet and slippery that they easily slid off. She spread her legs as I pushed two fingers into her.</p> <p>"Are you sure about this?" she asked, while I continued to finger-fuck her. "I don't want to hurt you."</p> <p>It seemed a little crazy all the while though; but I felt that no more had to be said. I quickly pushed first one then two fingers into her pussy. Then began adding a third finger. My wife kept moaning. "Harder lover. That's it. I want you to come for me."</p> <p>"I'm so close," was all I could manage. "I'm going to cum. I'm going to make you feel good about yourself."</p> <p>"That's good. I bet the guys at work just wanted to feel you do that!"</p> <p>"They said it hurt too much to cum all the time. I never realized how good it could feel like." With that, she pushed her hips up at the same time and began to fuck my fingers. This caused my thumb to slide over her clit.</p> <p>She was coming really hard, and then I felt her body relax. I kept sucking her clit to make myself cum, while fingering her harder. After about 30 seconds, I told her it was time to take the next step.</p> <p>"Why don't you turn your phone off so we can share a little fantasy."</p> <p>"What's it about?" my wife asked</p> <p>"I don't know yet."</p> <p>"I'll help you set it up."</p> <p>"But I'm not sure it would work."</p> <p>"Maybe it would and maybe not, but I want you to see how you get on with this man."</p> <p>She looked hesitant. "That's a good idea."</p> <p>"I don't want you on the other end, just the one at this point." As I said this, I turned my thumb over her clit once more. This was a new feeling for me, but also one I enjoyed even more. And to make it even more exciting, I was working her harder with my own hand, trying to put more pressure on her clit.</p> <p>Finally, she said, "I want to go to the bathroom. I don't want it messy."</p> <p>As she turned around, I looked back to see her face. She had a strange look on her face.</p> <p>"I'll just be here a little longer."</p> <p>I quickly turned around and left me. When I got to the bathroom, two guys walked in. They were completely surprised, and I could tell they wanted to say something to her. But for now, I was in a nice mood.</p> <p>"Do you mind if I watch my husband fuck another woman? I don't want himâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
