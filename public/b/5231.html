He just smiled at me and winked. "Now this is one thing you'll never have to worry about, isn't it?" I nodded and he went out. It was only as he left me that I began to wonder if it was possible.</p> <p>A couple of weeks later I decided that my feelings for him were very strong. I decided to throw one of the few things that my family could do for me away, and then put my life back where it belonged. I began looking for men and women that were my own age, and I was getting better at being a model. I started to watch the people I was with. They weren't all as young and handsome as I was, but they were definitely good looking and had a good sense of humor when I found them. Some were so shy that even if I didn't want to talk them wouldn't say no to one of them.</p> <p>One particular guy I went out with was one of the kindest we had known. He was a former Marine and had just turned twenty nine. We dated and got married four months after. He was the most considerate lover I'd ever had. He never failed to please me and I loved it. Even after he left I was on his mind for the last four months. I had been hoping it would still be.</p> <p>That day I had gone to the store and bought a new dildo. I had left one of the dildos there the first time he came in. I hadn't had time since then to use it on anyone of my friends, but he was a different story. I didn't plan on using it on anyone who did to and from work, but I thought he could probably use it pretty well once he got used to it.</p> <p>I didn't know that I liked having him around though. I loved when he would come to me looking for me and be there for me. Sometimes a girl would come in, he'd be able to talk to me and I'd have to answer to him and get rid of any possible problems.</p> <p>The second we got back to the house I was worried. He hadn't moved out of his house yet, and I had no idea of what he had intended to do with all of his things. I knew, but I wasn't sure what to expect. I would be the one to get him from school and he would never be able to show up when I did. It had hurt so much to be with him.</p> <p>It was like I had been looking for a boyfriend for a long time and I could feel my life getting more and more short because of his absence. I thought it best to start over and not look back any further. I still hadn't said anything to him, but I would at some point.</p> <p>So I came up with a lot of interesting ideas about getting to know him. I knew he wouldn't be as much of a disappointment as he had been and I had been pretty confident he would enjoy his time in school. I hoped that I could get him out of school for good and give him one good chance to improve. I knew he could get me good grades, but I really wanted something special and I had the feeling that he wasn't worth living with. I was ready to take things slow and see what sort of life I was looking for.</p> <p>I put a little more thought into it and decided that at least to start with, I wasn't going to give into temptation every time I found myself. I would be looking at other candidates while I did the research and I had some free time. I also got my friends a date with the professor that I really needed if I was to have at least a chance in my life.</p> <p>The first time I really talked to Tom he seemed happy enough. They were going out and I decided I would invite him home. I figured if things had been a little less he might have let me stay the night. I wasn't interested in getting too far, but Tom seemed friendly and interested in me. He told me he was on his way home and he would meet me in the morning. I didn't ask how and he just smiled and said he would see me tomorrow. He had a big house in the suburbs and had some kind of gym in the basement so a workout seemed like a decent idea.</p> <p>I arrived at the little gym early because I really wanted to go get some yoga shoes and workout for it. I spent the first couple of weeks working out in the weight room before returning home. I got home and got a change of clothes from the gym. I came out to the kitchen to see Tom in the living room eating a sandwich. "Hey, Baby," he smiled while taking the sandwich from me. "I didn't think you were coming in tonight."</p> <p>"No, I was just going to sit downâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
