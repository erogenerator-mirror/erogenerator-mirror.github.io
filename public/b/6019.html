She giggled, then turned her head towards me. A couple of times, she raised her hand, letting her fingers dangle so our fingers could touch and tickle at the same time. Her pink areolas were pebbled and puffed and puffy, her nipple was rigid and full, like her clit. She continued talking to me as if nothing was happening, then her fingers moved downward between her legs. In an instant, she was rubbing her clit, making an "Oh" sound and twisting her hand back and forth in front of my face. My face was on fire and my cock was stiff, so it throbbed out of instinct as she pressed my head into her wet, open crotch. I looked up at her face, watching every move her fingers made. She moved her lower body, trying to hump her face, to put her lips back on my cock or to have my lips on her clit. She was moving quickly, almost out of control and she kept talking to me, sometimes saying things like "Oh I'm cumming," but mainly just describing the sexual feeling.</p> <p>My fingers were flying in and out of her wet hole while we drove. I was not going to last very long; I knew I would go off in a second or two. I was looking at her face, trying to determine if I would cum the moment I felt her fingers moving on her clit or if I would cum over the top. We were both breathing heavily and she was still talking to me but then she stopped and began kissing me softly on the lips, then back to where it started, then she kissed me again, again kissing my lips, and again pressing her moist lips to mine, pressing her tongue into my mouth. My cock was aching and I could see the outline of my erection as it strained my pants.</p> <p>"I think we are close to cumming," she said, as she kissed me again.</p> <p>Our mouths separated and we looked at each other as I looked down at her and smiled. Our faces were only inches apart apart and our lips were aching. We laughed and moved further, both trying to prolong the experience. Her hand moved and pressed to my crotch harder and tighter.</p> <p>I ran my fingers slowly from side to side across her thigh, up and down to her warm, wet pussy. My fingers parted the outer lips of her pussy. I could feel the wetness of her pussy and felt her hand pressing on my arm, trying to lift my hand so she could rub her clit harder against me. My hand began to slide up and down inside of her, sliding across her clitoris while we looked each other in the face. She was whispering little "yes" sounds to me as my fingers slid across her pussy. This is more than I had ever imagined, and I knew exactly what she was doing. She was trying to hump her face and her hand was pressing harder against my cock. She was rubbing her clit hard and I could feel her face pressing down on mine and could see her head moving back and forth, as my fingers slid on either side of her, one way to me and the other way to her. She was so turned on and her hand had her clit tingling that I could feel it pressing down on my finger. Each time I could imagine her pussy lips open, and her clit, so swollen and hard pressed against my finger. I thought I would cum before I did, but, I was just getting hotter and hornier.</p> <p>"I can't hold it back any longer," I whispered to her.</p> <p>"Oh really? And what are you trying to say?" She raised herself a little so I could see the wetness of her pussy against the bottom side of her hand. She had a smile on her face; and then she just looked at me, her eyes almost pleading.</p> <p>"I can't hold it. I'm going to cum," I said, and she laughed, but the breath was coming out in a ragged rhythm.</p> <p>"Wait. Wait until I start to rub you again, then cum all over my hand." She continued to hold on to her hand against my cock, but I could tell she was getting more nervous. She put both hands to her face and tried to stop from making a sound, and then I could see that she was looking into my eyes, as if searching for a sign that she should back off.</p> <p>"Okay, I want you to cum all over my hand, so just hold it for a minute," I told her, but she didn't move or move from under the force of my fingers to her pussy.</p> <p>"No, I want to suck you off first, okay?" I asked her, and she nodded, as she lifted me off the seat, and sat me back down, then lay on top of meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
