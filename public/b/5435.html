The late afternoon sun was still dancing off the trees and the faint glow left the forest with an aura of danger. They stood outside the car for some time, just staring up at the stars. They both started their journey home with a big smile.</p> <p>They talked again on the way home, laughing and talking about a lot of good things. Neither felt the need to rush home to the bed, there being a lot going through their minds. It never felt as good as it did the past few months when they were around each other.</p> <p>In the end, they agreed to get off at the house, their home. As they turned towards the main house they turned their heads towards each other, looking at each other with a look of worry and uncertainty in their eyes.</p> <p>As they approached the front of the house, they both paused, waiting for their eyes to adjust. In that moment, their first thought was of how they should have ended it. They quickly found their hearts beating together a little faster, the excitement in those eyes making them feel the need to make those last several seconds feel more pleasurable.</p> <p>When their eyes met, it became like a magnetism seemed to sweep through them, they both knew at that moment something was going to happen. The feeling was electric, one of those times when there was a possibility of breaking down or passing out. It made both smile and be anxious; they needed each other more than ever or they wouldn't even be able to say goodbye.</p> <p>Kneeling on the ground, they gazed at each other, their faces moving closer. Their tongues danced in each others' mouth and they both opened each others' eyes with a smile. Their hands moved to their pants, where they were suddenly shy and didn't seem to want to go any further.</p> <p>Neither felt the need to ask for sex. This was an everyday thing each one would not touch each other with, only to experience it from time to time. This was a first for both of them. Even though the sex had been slow and intense, there was still a feeling of passion between them that they couldn't seem to deny.</p> <p>As their fingers gently touched each others' lips, the heat coming between them became hotter. It was obvious to both that they wanted as much as each other had to have something. Even though they never wanted to tell each other their love, neither had always wanted to be intimate with another. They both wanted to feel what it would be like to make the other feel the same way. It was their first attempt at lovemaking.</p> <p>Their kissing intensified, their hands feeling each other, rubbing each others' clothes; exploring each others' bodies. As their hips felt the touch of each others' bodies, they felt like they could climax like only they could.</p> <p>For some reason, both of them sensed it. Their lips pressed and felt each others' tongue exploring their mouths. Neither had felt the passion like they felt now. That feeling seemed to only grow more intense as they tried to push each others' passion into their hearts.</p> <p>The kiss was the perfect height and depth to make it last. They broke away from each other's kiss. Their eyes had a dreamy look on them as their fingers continued to explore each others' body. They didn't care about what the other one wanted or needing, they were just doing whatever they could do for one another.</p> <p>As their hands slid over each others bodies they felt their heart racing with anticipation. Their bodies were so different with their hair and skin; their legs more slender with their hips and legs slightly curved. It's how they had dreamed about this moment. The feeling of the coolness of a forest, no heat to touch each others' skin. The softness of a warm night's night breeze as they lay in their clothes waiting for their own passion.</p> <p>As they neared each other they both felt the heat and the desire in their hearts. It was the moment they both knew they shared. They were so close together. It wasn't enough yet but the moment they were ready was everything they were. It felt like they were going to be one another's forever, a happy happy couple.</p> <p>They looked into each other's eyes and said nothing as their gaze met. They just had to feel something. They were not just in love, they were in desire. They both felt an emotional connection, they both felt they could make something better.</p> <p>Taking the first step forward, they embraced one another with passion and desire. When they sat next to each other, neither one knew what to do next. They were both too happy to think of anything else other than holding each other in their arms.</p> <p>The warm smell of summer brought back memories of summer and their passion for each other, in the way they were kissing. The feel and aroma of the fresh sea air.
