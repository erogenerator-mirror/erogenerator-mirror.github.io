"That's just what I want. All of me."</p> <p>"But, I think I can tell what she could mean... with that... look."</p> <p>"I know," she said, running her hands down my chest. "And I know what that would do to you. I can feel it in your muscles. When I got pregnant, I could feel your stress and lack of endurance just about whenever I had kids. I could feel the tension, as well as the excitement. You were nervous for a while, but I had the feeling that it was because you were having a baby. I can't explain it, but I'm pretty sure you're the same way. You look so sexy."</p> <p>I ran my hands through her luxuriant hair as she leaned down and drew my cock into her. I was surprised that I could feel her pussy, so tight in there, grip my cock so tightly.</p> <p>"It's okay," I said, as her weight pressed me against the bed. "Just let it go, okay? I know you can give it to me, and you can keep it going as long as you like. You're just going to have to make sure you don't leave me hanging. It's just a part of you, just like my body. And the way she's going, that's a little too much fun."</p> <p>"I can think of a few places that'd be fun, too," she said, as we laid there, me between her legs, and her hands, which had been lightly caressing my chest, slid down to my cock. "Let's see?"</p> <p>"It's going to happen," I assured her. "And that's why it's so special. Because it's you."</p> <p>I gently stroked down her neck with my thumb and forefinger, trailing a path down to her breasts. She tipped her head to the side, closing her eyes, and smiled at me. I let my thumb trail down her stomach and across to the line of hair between her legs.</p> <p>"Are you sure?" she asked.</p> <p>"I'm sure," I answered, as I traced down her side. "Just let yourself go."</p> <p>I brought my hand back up to her breasts, feeling the swell of the flesh. I brought my lips up close to her breast, kissing her in the places that made her nipples stand out, where her areolae were the most sensitive of all. I circled them with my tongue, then moved my lips to it, and kissed. I was in a trance, as my cock began to rub itself in the cleft between her legs.</p> <p>"Oh, God!" she squealed, as my tongue circled her nipple. "I knew it!"</p> <p>I kept moving my fingers on her breasts as I kissed my way down her body, then over her stomach and abdomen, across her mound, as my lips slowly kissed her from hip to hip. I could smell her arousal, and saw my hand glistening as my eyes feasted on it. "Mmmm," she cooed. "I like it when you lick me," she said, as her hands came up to cup my face. "I like it when you stroke my..."</p> <p>I didn't have to finish that sentence, as I brought my mouth right to her pussy as I began to explore, and she was already wet. I brought my own lips to her and licked as I inserted my tongue between her lips.</p> <p>"You taste marvelous," I whispered, as I flicked my tongue across her clit, and she jumped. "You're so beautiful."</p> <p>I went back to sucking, licking, and nibbling, as I let one finger slide up and down her canal. She was moaning softly now, and I had to remind myself that she wasn't really my daughter. I stopped my oral ministrations just before she was about to orgasm, because, well, that would mean I'd have to do some serious work to prevent it.</p> <p>"Not yet," I said at length.</p> <p>She groaned, her back arching, her eyes fluttering. "Please!" she groaned. "Please, yes, yes, yes, don't stop. Please. Oh, please, harder, yes, oh, please!"</p> <p>I could only do so lightly as my tongue and lips continued their assault. I felt her wetness on my tongue, and moved my head slightly as I began to push my mouth towards her, sucking on her lips and clitoris. Her hips thrust upwards, then fell back onto the bed, pushing up on her hands as sheâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
