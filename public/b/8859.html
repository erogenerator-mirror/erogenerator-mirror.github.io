He had never had such an incredible orgasm, not that he had gotten much of that before. The girl who had sucked his cock had been the one to take his load. There was no other girl or woman he had slept with in his life that he had imagined in those circumstances. Now here he was with this angel.</p> <p>Honey had been an instant sensation, and she had loved every minute of sucking, tongue kissing and cum sucking. He pulled her tight to him as he fucked her wet mouth, and she was moaning in pleasure as he reached his own climax.</p> <p>Holly could barely take some of the cum she was sucking and swallowing as her own orgasm had been so intense. She wondered if she could swallow him. The thought thrilled her, but there was no way that she would let him go. She did her best not to spit the cum out of her mouth. They didn't do that very often and most girls ended up getting all the cum. When he had told her that she had only been able to spit out his cum in the past couple of months. He wanted her to keep his cum in her mouth and suck it off. A little part of Holly was a dirty little girl. He was determined to make up for that.</p> <p>As they walked out of the hotel, they passed a few guys still in the lobby. Holly was a little worried. Some of them had been in there as long as they had been in there and they had seen everything. They didn't seem to care. Some of them were clearly gay. One guy was the oldest of the many, but that didn't stop him from eyeing Holly's butt. Her skirt was so short that it could barely cover her round cheeks. She felt herself blushing as they passed him in the lobby. His eyes kept coming back. It seemed that he was trying to watch her, but his attention was drawn to the rest of her. She was feeling a little ashamed that she had let the young man in the lobby drool at her.</p> <p>"Hey, buddy!" Holly turned to face him. He was the first one to come up to her as she walked to the elevator. "I was wondering if you could help me." Holly said.</p> <p>"Sure, what could you do?" Steve replied. "Can I buy you dinner?"</p> <p>Holly smiled and took the chance to explain the situation. "I was wondering," she continued, "if I could get up to make dinner for you tonight." She was feeling a little flushed, and didn't know what she was talking about. She was afraid she had gone too far already. She could have been in too much trouble.</p> <p>"That's really nice of you, but I don't need all this help. I have to leave early next week. But I don't want to be late. I mean, with the amount of men you have had, and the amount of orgasms you have had, I feel like I need it."</p> <p>"Really? Well, I guess I could make you an evening of it." Holly's hand was sliding up his leg, and she wasn't the least bit surprised to find that he was already hard again. "Let me get this straight. What do you need tonight?"</p> <p>"Maybe a nice bath!" It was a little hard for him not to giggle. Her idea of a bath was to have a shower so she would have a little something to get him going.</p> <p>"I'll think about it. And maybe we could go get our stuff, I'm sure you have a good time."</p> <p>"Oh yes, definitely!" He said with the beginnings of a smile. "We'll catch up later."</p> <p>They both smiled.</p> <p>Holly was still flushed and feeling a little embarrassed; though her heart was pounding in her chest. She had never really been a big drinker, but here she was as eager as ever for more of Steve. She felt that excitement that comes from being good at something. She hoped he had a good time. The thought of going home with him would get her horny again. Now that she had said it, she was hoping he would make a move, but for now, they were good friends.</p> <p>Steve turned to walk away from her again. She watched as she caught a quick glance of the young man's cock swinging beneath his robe.</p> <p>Holly had a good time at the hotel. And after having had lots of sex already, she wanted more. It seemed that many of the men she had gone with were still in there, either with friends or with girlfriends. There seemed to be a bit of a lull, however, when other men came on to them. She did see a couple of men she had had sex with there, but she didn't really expect to see their faces in there. That is, if they were still in there.
