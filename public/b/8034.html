She smiled and nodded.</p> <p>"Thanks."</p> <p>"No, thanks," he smiled. He had a point, he thought.</p> <p>"Is it time to stop for gas anyway?" she asked and took off walking toward her car.</p> <p>"Yeah, get in your car," he said, and she nodded. She drove past him as her headlights illuminated the road leading to the reservoir and she started to turn on her car. She stopped a couple of moments later and looked back at him as he walked toward her, and he nodded.</p> <p>"No, I'm taking you." He got his door and opened it for her. "You ride on one side and I'll use the other," he smiled. She nodded.</p> <p>"Yeah, okay," she said and got into the car. She was impressed with how comfortable it was to get to so many places in her living room.</p> <p>"My roommates are going to be here soon," he said as she drove off. "Have fun!" he said as she turned the ignition off and got out of the car. She headed inside her apartment as he followed her up the stairs and out to the passenger side. She got into the driver's seat and pulled his door closed.</p> <p>"Ready?" she asked him.</p> <p>"Ready!" he said and opened her door, leaning the seat back until his knees could barely touch. He slid down between her knees and leaned into her. She put her arms around his head as he slowly kissed her lips. She leaned into him and kissed him back. She smiled to herself as he got even more turned on from the kiss.</p> <p>"You've done this before," she whispered to him. He smiled and nodded to her. She pulled her top off and then her bra so he could kiss her chest, and then his hands went back to her breasts. Her nipples were hard beneath his hands, and he massaged them as they rubbed against each other. She pulled his lips down to her right nipple so his tongue could lick it. His fingers circled her nipple and he massaged it in turn, while he kissed the top of her breast.</p> <p>"Mmmmm," she moaned, pulling her top off and throwing it to the floor. He kissed his way down her belly and stopped to circle her navel and start to kiss it. He kept kissing as he slowly ran his tongue across her bellybutton. He had her completely naked and waiting for him, and that was exactly what he was going to do. He slowly slid his hands down her legs and up. He kissed his way back up her leg, pausing at each knee, and then moving to her thighs. He worked his way back up her thighs, getting a lip-lock on her pussy that made her gasp. She closed her eyes to savour everything he was doing as he continued.</p> <p>"Mhhhmmm," she moaned as his tongue made the right move on her pussy, and he began to lick her. He kissed her clit as he did, and then used his tongue to circle around it as he entered his tongue slowly, making it as deep inside her as it could go. He made sure to bring his tongue up her pussy like he did before. He used his thumbs to spread her lips, exposing her tiny pink pearl.</p> <p>"You're so wet," he moaned as he continued to work on her pussy, his tongue going even deeper inside her. She grabbed at his head and pulled him up to kiss her as she went still. She kept her knees on the seat as he started to work her pussy with his tongue, and they ended up just like before, just with their tongues. He started to rub her clit with the tip of his tongue and she moaned as it brushed against it, making her feel good. He brought his fingers up and massaged her as he sucked on her clit, making her arch her back a little. He brought his tongue over her sensitive nub and her body shuddered.</p> <p>"Oh, god, oh yeah ..." she moaned as he went back to her clit, moving down to her tunnel. He slowly pushed his tongue from side to side, moving it in circles as he continued to rub her clit with his tongue. He brought his fingers up and rubbed his tongue on her opening making her gasp. He brought his fingers to his mouth and slowly slid his fingers inside her pussy as he continued to circle her clit. He brought his hand back and started rubbing himself while he sucked on her clit as his fingers slowly pushed in and out of her pussy. She was moving to meet his finger as he continued to rub and suck on her clit.</p> <p>"Mmmmmm, yeah ..." she moaned as sheâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
