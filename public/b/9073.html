"I was just thinking that I might be able to get some sleep tonight if you would fuck me after the game," he adds. We lay on top of each other as our bodies writhe against each other's. I kiss his nose and cheeks and then his lips and he says, "So, Sam, what do you want to do tonight? I said you could be with me. Maybe we could go to bed and have some fun," he says.</p> <p>"Oh, I'd love to," he says, and then pulls his head back and looks into my eyes. "But, we'll have to meet you at the entrance."</p> <p>"I'll see you soon," I say as I kiss him and hold his hand on my breast. I'm not sure if I know exactly what that means, but I'm pretty sure I should go to bed with him. Or, maybe, I should go meet him on the other side of campus and see what happens.</p> <p>"Goodnight, Sam," I say softly. He says, "It's a great night," and then is gone. I am out the door before he can say anything more about the night before.</p> <p>The Endâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
