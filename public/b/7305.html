Myself, I wasn't sure what to say, I was still in my car. And she was not in the middle of the road anymore.</p> <p>"Come over, I haven't seen the car in awhile," I could barely breathe. As I went to the door, she caught me and smiled at me, "You want to come in anyway?"</p> <p>"Oh yeah, I am. And now it is your turn!" I told her, the words not fitting with the moment.</p> <p>She opened the door and I helped her in, and then we headed back to the club. She made me the lead singer and I did the lead vocals, she made the lead vocals, I did the chorus vocals, and we had a good time, as we took our first break with a slow dance. I knew the routine, and I could go with it. But I had to put on a couple of songs, because I wasn't sure I could stand to be singing with a live beat on, and so it was going to take me a bit of time and getting used to my new songs. There had to be a way to convince her I was serious, and not just about the song. I thought I could take a back road and drive us back to my place and still have time to get a decent sound out with my other songs.</p> <p>So as soon as we got back to my place, I put the lead singer on, because he had the lead vocals, and she was able to give directions, I knew there was nothing good for me but just to sit around and listen. She told me she didn't like this, as this was kind of her big time gig, so she would just stay right here with me. And she was a big fan of mine, and she wanted to see it played, so we could talk and talk and listen. She had told me she was really into the song, and I could listen to her and have a good time too. But I was going to have to get some control. It would be pretty obvious that this wasn't a good idea.</p> <p>I had put the track in, and that time in the car was the perfect time to be here, as she was dancing and singing with me. I kept a very low volume of the song, and when I said "No, no, no, no" and she immediately stopped dancing, she smiled and said; "This song is perfect, I don't think you have any choice in the matter." I told her that I didn't think she would be very happy with the situation. But she said that was fine with her, she said that it meant that I needed to let go and let my inhibitions go. And so I took my time and kept up my slow, but rhythmic beat. I had her moving around a bit, and moving just a little so that we could get our own music on each other. She was moving her hips and her body to the music, and I noticed that she looked pretty hot dancing. I thought this would be great, I was in a situation where I wanted to be more than just good, and I would need to really get to my music.</p> <p>Her hands were in my lap and my arms were just about my neck, and my voice was still a little rough, "How was rehearsing?"</p> <p>She smiled and said; "So, are you going to ask my permission and see if I can put some music on your record?"</p> <p>"Well, you have to remember, it is a record, not my first set. There is a part-time manager."</p> <p>"Really, I guess so, I really didn't think you would be interested in this kind of thing. I am not really sure that you would want to do some stuff like this with me, and I thought you meant that. My job is not to let your inhibitions go, but it sounds like it might be more fun with you being my first song on it."</p> <p>"Well, if you are going to be my first song on it, then I want it to be more than just a piece of music. We aren't going to use the song to talk around. I like it." With that, I kissed her softly and then pulled my head back, and said; "Let's go dance."</p> <p>She smiled again, "OK," and let me go. I turned around and put my arms around her, and we started walking off towards my place. It was getting late, our break was over, we had just ended a couple of hours before. I had her stop a couple of times, but that time was going to be great, so I let her get behind me and give me a little space. She did all the rest, as I was starting to lose my composure and start to feel lightheaded, "So, it is just about time for us to go back."
