They ordered champagne, champagne and cognac, and sat down.</p> <p>"I was very surprised that I got the opportunity to use the island as a place for the coming of the new school year, even considering the work I put in the previous school year, I was surprised when you called me."</p> <p>"I wasn't upset that you wanted to do this, you were not upset that we were going through a tough time."</p> <p>"I can't explain why, why I felt the need to make it an important day for both of us, but it was something in my heart. Our lives have turned upside down. I couldn't let anything else spoil what was going on here. I couldn't give up this job I couldn't do it."</p> <p>He looked at her intently, like he was appraising her. She looked sad, but didn't seem in any kind of pain. "There is no sadness in me, there isn't. There isn't a sense of sadness in you. You came here as a girl and I thought I understood why the world fell apart for you after you passed.</p> <p>"I wanted you out of my house, and now I know why."</p> <p>At that moment, a knock came at the door. It was the captain. He looked startled and then went to look as if he had been expecting someone.</p> <p>"What do you think you're doing Jack?" Jack asked.</p> <p>"The crew is done. I was taking a drink of champagne and preparing myself for a week on the island. We aren't to have anything mixed up in here."</p> <p>The crew walked out of the cabin and they headed towards the door. While they were waiting, Jack explained a bit of what had happened in the last three days.</p> <p>"The first thing when we woke up is I guess we both got excited, but the second thing was we were both thinking things were going to change. We both had a lot of time, but a lot wasn't sure we really wanted it to happen."</p> <p>Jack nodded his head in agreement. He then asked, "How do you feel about having the boat back on the island that the company paid the company to set up on it?"</p> <p>"I'm just a little apprehensive. I haven't had the chance to really see the place yet. It sounds like we will be back home in no time.</p> <p>"We could still hear the ship moving outside, but we won't be the only ones being thrown back to the ship."</p> <p>"What? You two are leaving the house to take care of things on the island?"</p> <p>"Yes sir, that's what I have been hoping to tell you," Jack spoke up.</p> <p>"Yes sir, they were already taking me home, but they are taking me where they want to go. They want you to take care of all of the things that we haven't been able to do. They will be here by the end of the week."</p> <p>Jack knew something about the ship. He never thought this strange. He was about to ask for it and his curiosity getting the better of him, he asked, "And what if we don't get out of the house soon?"</p> <p>"That depends," Jack spoke to him.</p> <p>"Jack, I don't know if we should be going back or not," Jack said.</p> <p>Jack pulled a piece of paper from his desk and wrote, "Call the captain and tell him to tell the crew that you wanted to work out a deal. We will be back on the island soon."</p> <p>Jack nodded to the captain as he got dressed. He called in the crew, the crew, and the captain. He put the paper into the lockbox, went to the captain, and gave it to him, "I want to offer you the captain's seat when you come back. The ship has arrived and will be taking us back to the island."</p> <p>Jack walked toward the deck. He put his papers on the deck and sat down as if he was sitting on a chair, the captain called to him in the captain's cabin. Jack sat still trying out all the things he had hoped to tell the captain. He had been working hard for the last week. He had been at the island for almost 2 weeks. He had never had anything like this before and it was the best thing that he could imagine. But now, he was alone. He couldn't even think about anything he had said from this place. They had never gone to the cabin, and were going to take the boat home in a few hours. He thought, that was a great idea, and the captain said, "Jack, I have a proposition for you."</p> <p>Jack got up and walked into the main cabin.
