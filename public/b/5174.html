He said as a few tears rolled down her face.</p> <p>I leaned over and kissed her, "And he's very good for you!"</p> <p>I could see I was about to blow some wad. I was so focused on doing everything with her this summer I didn't even realize that we were in my car. But I felt like we'd been apart for years instead of just days.</p> <p>"And...!" I paused in my kissing to look at her and saw that this time was different to what she'd had since I've known her. She was a beautiful, sexy women. I could see, I knew, that I was not going to lose her.</p> <p>"And I'm sure it's too hard for you not to say that, but you've gotta hear this too. I mean that if I'm going to get into what it means for me to become sexually adventurous, I need to take a second and third try, 'cause you're the hottest woman around, and I don't believe that a girl, or a boy or you, who could possibly give a man better sex than you can, but don't you just want to fuck? Then, as a gift I might even ask the guy or girlfriend who lives near where in the city he lives or lives to be with you to get his or her permission too."</p> <p>I moved one hand to her breast and lightly stroked her nipple as I said this. I knew this would excite her and she wanted me too.</p> <p>"Well now...," I paused again, feeling like my cock was about to fall out of my pants, "I want you too!"</p> <p>She immediately stood up on her toes and began rubbing her breasts together. I reached for her, pulled her to me, and felt her lips on mine, for the first time in over three years. "I want to see them!" she whispered.</p> <p>"OK then," I said as I leaned back in the truck and undid my pants and let them drop. I helped her to stand and she slipped the dress down her hips so it fell to the ground on the floor. She then reached behind her, unhooked her bra and with one hand began rubbing her nipples.</p> <p>"Oohh that feels so good..." she moaned as she started tweaking her nipple between her fingers.</p> <p>A minute or two later we were making our way back to her apartment. I had put on a clean shirt. I knew I needed to wash my hands before we did anything else. I wanted to feel her against me.</p> <p>She led me inside and kissed me hard before sitting on the couch again. We began to kiss deeply and as she reached her hand down I had both hands on her ass. I pulled her tight against me and pulled her hair down with one hand while I unzipped her dress. I reached down for her bra and began to rub her breasts as we kissed.</p> <p>I reached behind her and felt her ass. She had lovely pale skin, and when I began to reach down to her vagina through her panties she arched her back and moaned, "I wanna do something for you" she whispered.</p> <p>"What do you want me to do?" I asked as she reached for the button and began to unfasten my pants. As the zipper was down her hand reached in and felt for my cock without actually doing anything. I groaned as she continued to rub my erection, my balls and my penis.</p> <p>"I want to kiss you!" she said.</p> <p>I unzipped her dress in back and pulled it from her shoulders. We were both naked, now she was standing in front of me with her pussy facing me. I looked between her legs at how perfect her body looked.</p> <p>I pulled her to me. I put one hand around one of her breasts, and slowly put the other hand inside her panties to rub her sex. I slid my finger from behind the material of her panties, across her clitoris, and down her lips.</p> <p>"Oh...!" she said. "Yes...right there!" And she began to shake and move her head back and forth. She pulled her breast away from me and reached behind and, pulling up the leg of her panties, put them on the sofa. I got up on the couch with her and we got to her on one leg and began to kiss again...hard.</p> <p>I pushed her knees further apart and then dropped myself down in between her legs so that I was on my knees facing her. My cock was standing at attention as I started to lick the inside of her pussy lips and then moved to her clit. I gently caressed her lips with the knuckles of my fingers, as I continued to suck her clit.</p> <p>I felt her body begin to quâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
