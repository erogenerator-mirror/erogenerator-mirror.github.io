It was a sign she truly believed he was right, even though she thought it was just a weird way to greet friends. "So what do you think it feels like to be able to do things when they're made to you?"</p> <p>There was a tone of concern in her voice and he realized he'd said too much, but he was still a bit pissed off. "What do you mean, 'make love'? Why can't we just do things together?"</p> <p>She sighed. "Well, because I've been really struggling with it. I really want to, but I never expected people to be able to make love to a couple just as hot, passionate as I do. If I'd been getting it from someone else, that would totally be a turn off."</p> <p>"So you're saying we make love together in that position?"</p> <p>She nodded. "Yeah, but what if I was a little too enthusiastic? Wouldn't one of the people in my life do it, wouldn't her and I do what we're doing?"</p> <p>"Exactly."</p> <p>"So I really am still a virgin," she said.</p> <p>"But you want to try it."</p> <p>"I do. But what if I want to have a couple of guys that I meet and don't get too into it?"</p> <p>"I'd be happy to help you have sex." He took a deep breathe and shook his head. "And if I were you, you'd be so happy."</p> <p>"And if you wanted me to have one boyfriend and not want to do anything because they're too much for you?"</p> <p>He was amazed at how much her eyes betrayed her hurt. And he had to smile as well. But he was still a bit upset that she'd come to the same conclusion as he'd been one time.</p> <p>"I think we'll probably only do it half way. But like I said, I'm not complaining."</p> <p>She looked at him for a moment. "Do you really think you'll be able to do that?"</p> <p>He nodded. "Maybe not if your mouth is full of dick, but if it's all the same for you, then yes."</p> <p>She laughed. "That should be obvious. But we'll have work to do to get some of what you gave us."</p> <p>A couple of hours later, after dinner, they sat outside on a patio in the backyard. The sun was already gone and the birds were chattering. She reached over and gave him half-hard erection, causing his pants to tighten. She sat down next to him. "Would you mind if I told you what I'm going to do next?"</p> <p>He thought for a moment. "Okay, here's what I'm going to do."</p> <p>"I know you aren't gay. No," she said slowly. "You want to touch me, but I'm not really attracted to men."</p> <p>"I understand. I'm actually not attracted to men either, I was just curious."</p> <p>She laughed. "I don't care if you are, but since you don't know I'm gay, I thought you might want me to make sure you're okay with me doing it. I'm just asking because I'm looking to make you feel good, to make your dick want to move around a little."</p> <p>He hesitated. "You're kidding. You're going to make me move around some."</p> <p>"Not only that, I'm saying that you should be very sensitive about other people's feelings about you and I can assure you it'll be alright."</p> <p>"I don't know. I'm not a virgin, but I can sure use the word good right now."</p> <p>She smiled. "Okay. I'll try to be less aggressive."</p> <p>He smiled back. "Thank you."</p> <p>She put her hand on his thigh again. "Do be careful. I'm a bit afraid of my reactions."</p> <p>"Not much," he replied. He leaned in and nuzzled her neck. "This is nice."</p> <p>"Yes, it is." She was moving, pressing her lips into his neck and kissing him passionately, so when he moved his lips to hers, so when she responded by reaching behind her and taking his erection with her hand, he had no problem responding to her move herself to position herself so they were a close distance. Their lips met and their tongues were dancing together.</p> <p>A minute or two later, they pulled apart. She leaned back on the stone patio again and looked out over the lush green landscape. They both took in the surroundings and then both stood. He looked down at her, realizing where everything began. Her beautiful face, her long hair spread out in her hair, her dark skin, and then her hands, taking one knee, and slidingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
