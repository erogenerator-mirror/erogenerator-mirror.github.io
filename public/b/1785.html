What can I...do for your pleasure?" she was still a little embarrassed, but she smiled with a twinkle in her eyes as her heart sped up and anticipation intensified. She was almost ready to orgasm when someone's voice came over the phone, "Room service, can I take a quick shower please?"</p> <p>"Of course, I'll be right with you."</p> <p>That little exchange brought a grin to her face. She smiled at her self satisfaction. She got up and went to the bathroom. She could hear him in the shower humming to himself as she stood there. She had to take a shower. She had been with men and women during her career for a long time now, she didn't want to break the spell of her job at the gym. She opened the shower curtain and stepped in.</p> <p>There was no one else in the bathroom except for the water, she took a good close inspection. She had a beautiful body, her tits were small, her ass had no real curves, but they were perfect. Her legs stood in an almost obscene shape, from her little waist to the curve of her waist and down to her thighs. Her skin looked as smooth and perfect as she had described. The only signs that she was real were her eyes, slightly darkened but very blue, and her hair was straight and blonde.</p> <p>She finished taking a shower and stepped out to take her own towel. She dried her hair as best she could from head to toe. She could see it was time to be done with this evening. She stood in the foyer and walked out to let the hot August breeze wash back past the bathroom. She felt better, but her thoughts were with someone else's body. She looked over at the window and saw someone coming down the street. She smiled and decided not to watch when she saw him. He had to get back to his job at the gym.</p> <p>She decided to call him, "Hey, it's me, what are you doing over at the gym?"</p> <p>"I'm just going to the gym."</p> <p>"Come on, can we talk then?"</p> <p>"Sure, I mean okay, I love what we talk about."</p> <p>"I know, I'm just not into talking about what we've done at the gym."</p> <p>She could still hear his voice, even though he was obviously not there.</p> <p>"There's something I need to tell you; I'm leaving. I'm really going in for a big promotion and I'm going to be retiring."</p> <p>"Really? I hope you take it to heart."</p> <p>"And you better, I love that you're going to be my boss. Just don't get too excited and you can always tell me to get ready."</p> <p>"Oh I will. I promise. Bye."</p> <p>"Byeee"</p> <p>It was a little after three. He had a little trouble getting home, "Where is she?"</p> <p>"She's at a sleepover at her sister's home tonight. She told me about it a little while ago, she got drunk and left her car at home, so I figured I'd meet her there. When I got there it was about seven."</p> <p>"Wow, I'm sorry that she left me at your home," she added, "I know what I did to my own work; that's just how I feel. I'm sorry. I should be with you."</p> <p>"You're the one who's acting strange. Go in the bathroom and I'll finish getting ready for her, okay?" he was starting to get frustrated.</p> <p>It was already ten at night, so it would take her a few moments to get ready. She looked at her reflection in the full length mirror, "I'm a little older, that's why I usually take to the bathroom in the afternoons, then the first thing I get after gym is food."</p> <p>She finished drying herself off and walked into the bedroom. Her hands went through her hair trying to make up for her long time job at the gym. She brushed her lips with her finger and then rubbed them to try to make her lips fuller for his tongue. She was thinking of him all day, thinking of kissing him. She felt a shudder of excitement as her breasts came into immediate contact with her arm, "You are a beautiful young woman."</p> <p>"I wasn't kidding, you are just like my sister. I think you just look so much sexier. Have you had this done before?" she asked as she brushed her breasts into a more aroused state.</p> <p>"Oh yeah, actually we met in college."</p> <p>"What does that mean?"</p> <p>"Not really, I don't usually like to have guys at my place to talk about girls."</p> <p>"Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
