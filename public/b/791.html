I looked over at her; she had her eyes closed now and was just leaning back against the counter now with her feet on the floor next to me. She ran her hand slowly over mine and gave it a gentle squeeze as we locked eyes again. She raised her head and bit her lip as she looked at me and let out a small laugh. "Ooooh, it's nice."</p> <p>"Yeah, I just wanted to see what it was like. You'll love this!" I managed to get out quickly.</p> <p>"Oh, I hope so. I want to feel it. I want to feel the warm, wet feeling and cum on my tongue!" She finished off by lifting her eyes to mine and smiling devilishly. "Now, finish cleaning me for real. I'm so worked up from all this and I have to pee really bad, can't stand that much."</p> <p>I ran my hand over her body again and noticed that it had gotten a little sweaty from our earlier activities but still there was nothing out of the ordinary. She leaned back so I could get better penetration, I slowly started to fuck her with long and sure strokes. I felt her get more aroused and her breathing start to increase again. I bent her legs back up and started to slide out as her thighs tightened around my waist. "OOOHHHH GAWD, THAT'S FUCKING GOOD!" She cried out. I looked up to her face from between her legs where I could see a small smile starting to form on her lips. "Do it now, fuck my tight little ass, give it to me, fuck me, take that hard cock deep, shove it in and make me cum all over that dick!"</p> <p>As I started to fuck her with long, hard strokes, I leaned forward into her body and grabbed her breasts to kiss her passionately. I kept my full attention on her body as her hands reached down to squeeze and stroke my ass as I continued to slide in and out.</p> <p>My eyes were locked onto hers as our faces moved closer to each other and I could see the lust in her eyes but was mesmerized by the view I was feeling. It had come back to me as well and it had an undeniable but undeniable effect on me.</p> <p>Sasha gave her chest back up to meet our kissing and I felt her body quiver as her body started to move more. I stopped kissing her and began to kiss her all across her neck and across her ear and then to rub her shoulder and down her arm to the side of her breast.</p> <p>We kept kissing and rubbing as I kissed and nibbled on her neck and down her left arm until I got to her right arm. The soft skin of it had given way to that of my mouth. My left hand rubbed slowly up her side and then back into her side where it came to rest on her hip.</p> <p>I could feel her body shivering as I squeezed her hip and then back against mine. She moaned as I started to kiss down a little lower onto her belly.</p> <p>I looked into her eyes as I moved back up and kissed her soft lips, as she watched me with growing interest. I placed a tiny bit of hot, wet kisses down her chin and down her neck. She looked up at me through her half closed eyelids as I kissed her neck. Her breathing became heavier as I finally took it into my mouth. I started to run my tongue all over her neck as I placed my lips there. I started to slowly run my tongue in long, slow circles over the top of her collar bone and down just off her collar bone and she closed her eyes in pleasure.</p> <p>I slid my tongue back down and started to kiss back up her neck. This time, my tongue traced a path to her breasts. I slowly kissed the left one and then back up it then across her nipple before taking it into my mouth. I sucked on it gently, lightly, for a moment and then let it pop out from between my lips with a groan.</p> <p>I looked down and looked into her eyes as I slid my tongue across her other nipple, first one in, then on, and then off, licking it each way.</p> <p>I kissed the tip of her breast and then took that into my mouth again as I ran my tongue back and forth across her nipple as I rubbed my right hand slowly up and down her side.</p> <p>"Mmmm, that feels good," she whispered. She opened her eyes and looked down at my wet and wet lips as I kissed her chest, then back up to her mouth.</p> <p>"I want you too," I replied, pulling my lips away from hers and starting to pull off her shirt.</p> <p>She opened her eyes again and smiled. "This feels so good."
