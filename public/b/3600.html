He said I could do anything, like be submissive to him, and I do it. I'm such a dirty girl and he knew it, too. I'm going to get a tattoo."</p> <p>"Wow. No, I think that's kind of cool."</p> <p>"But wait. This isn't a date. Please don't do anything to me, sir."</p> <p>"Honey, I'm not sure I want to. Your hands are dirty, and it might be fun to feel them. I can't."</p> <p>"I'll be good," she said, and began spreading and spreading her arms.</p> <p>He smiled. "Honey, I'll be good. I love you. You don't want me to go all romantic."</p> <p>He grabbed her hair and pulled her head back, her eyes closed in ecstasy. She looked over his shoulder and smiled.</p> <p>He reached into his pocket, and took out a leather dog collar. He held it against her for a minute before letting it go. "There's something else, baby," he whispered, "that's special for you."</p> <p>She opened her eyes to see him kneeling behind her, looking at her. He took a leather collar from the box. She thought she might feel chills to know that she looked so delicate to him. He smiled, and placed it around her neck.</p> <p>"You're getting bigger, honey," he whispered in her ear. She felt so delicate to him.</p> <p>She felt like she was melting under his loving gaze. She loved being his plaything. She loved having him in her bed, watching her as he ate her up. She felt so happy to finally be his little girl, and to be giving him the puppy. She looked over her shoulder at him as he knelt before her, taking his time with her ass.</p> <p>She felt his hot breath as he nuzzled her cheek. She felt the collar. He gave her a hard smack to her ass, causing her to open her eyes for a moment, and seeing his smile. "You're a good girl," he whispered in her ear.</p> <p>"Thank you, Sir, I deserve it."</p> <p>"No thank you, my girl," he repeated with a soft laugh. "No need for that. You're so beautiful, and I love the way you look when you're naked," he said, running a hand over her body.</p> <p>She felt small and shivery under his touch and felt every inch of her. He could tell she was excited because he felt that same heat that she felt. He reached up and put his hands on her breasts as he rubbed her, feeling their softness under his fingertips. He heard her inhale sharply, and he knew she was anticipating his touch for a moment. He looked down and smiled as he saw her breasts shaking under the pressure he applied to them.</p> <p>"You do have great breasts, doll."</p> <p>"Thank you, Sir." She tried not to make the word hurtingly sound like 'fuck' for the next moment.</p> <p>He felt her hand on his crotch, and his own penis began to get aroused by her touch. "Honey," he whispered, "do something for me, please."</p> <p>She put her hands over his eyes, and he felt her mouth on his collar. He heard her slurping as saliva leaked from between her lips. "Honey, honey," he whispered softly, "please?"</p> <p>She felt his mouth close around her nipples, and she closed her eyes and began pushing her breasts into his mouth. "Sir," she said with a half-whispered whine, "please?"</p> <p>He held his head in place around her hard nipple, feeling her hand on his own crotch, stroking his organ. He could feel the hot rush of pre-cum seeping from his scrotum. "Honey," he repeated, "please?"</p> <p>"Sir, it's your turn to be pleasured."</p> <p>"Honey," he groaned as his lips came off of her nipple, "I'm not sure I can do anything for you. How about if I go take a shower, then get some rest and we will talk about this?"</p> <p>"That would be very good, Sir. You don't have to do anything. I'll go in the other room."</p> <p>"Honey, you have a nice body. I don't think you should feel embarrassed, doing something you're not proud of."</p> <p>"Oh, thank you, Sir. I'll be good."</p> <p>She heard his breathing get heavier, and knew he was getting close to what she had been looking for. "Mmmm.
