"A quick fuck and a quiet night?" and with that we both collapsed.</p> <p>After a while I asked for more sleep.</p> <p>"You know, I should be going home, the boys will come to the front desk on Monday morning at seven. What about you?" I asked. "What time?"</p> <p>She went into her room and shut the door, sat down, and turned on the TV.</p> <p>***</p> <p>When I finally got home I went straight up to my office and found an e-mail from an interesting man, a friend of my father-in-law I had never met. He had gone on to some interesting chat sites and was now on a dating site which included some erotic stories, and was a good friend with whom some really interesting people were going to be staying at our house for a month. I didn't really know if I should tell him the truth of whether or not I was really attracted to him, but I decided to take the risk.</p> <p>I had put all of my trust in his offer. If I didn't agree to his terms it would be his word against mine. His address was a nice house in a quiet suburb where there were a lot of little houses and he could be pretty charming. I decided that I needed to tell him the whole truth, and just go with it.</p> <p>I checked the e-mail and found a man from a dating site and he seemed a bit serious about it. I was surprised that he had even considered coming to live with me. Of course I didn't give a shit because I know I couldn't stop myself anyway and he was a nice guy!</p> <p>He told me how attracted he was to me and what a great time we had had together, his name was Andrew and he had been working from a job he started while he was in Korea to get a degree in marketing. He described how great his life was, we talked almost every day and I was intrigued by it. He was actually quite charming and made me feel a touch of warmth when I mentioned the idea of being his live-in girlfriend. I was interested in meeting him, so I did.</p> <p>We talked about my relationship and our sex life for about a few days. He seemed so sincere about his need to have me around and how we could be friends, and also, we agreed that we both wanted to get to know each other more. He said he also needed to know that I was attracted to him, that I was interested in sex with him, that I liked it rough, and that I was curious about it. I was even surprised by his enthusiasm and the way he reacted to all of it.</p> <p>When he wrote back to me I told him that I was attracted to him too, and that I hoped that we could meet sooner rather than in a hurry and that I had already told my folks that I wasn't going to go to college in England. We made an agreement that we would meet on the last day of every month or so. When we did decide that we would meet that day I was surprised, at first and then even turned on at how he seemed to be making me nervous at just the thought of meeting him.</p> <p>I wasn't sure if I should say anything before he said "Yes". And to be fair there was also a bit of excitement about the fact that I didn't even know if my parents would mind that I would be coming to live with him that day, and the fact that I had to be there. I did however tell him that that I was only here to stay until about eight and that I was excited about spending time with him. That was a big relief and not too much more.</p> <p>And then about what Andrew and I could do.</p> <p>I was really nervous about meeting him.</p> <p>I don't really know anyone named Andrew and I didn't even know anyone named Alex. But I did know Alex a lot like Andrew and we were both a little less cautious than the others.</p> <p>I had no plans to meet Andrew in the first place because I was sure he could be quite charming. He was a nice big guy and he did look a bit like his real name... well, not as an English name. Also, when I spoke to him he looked more or less the opposite of Andrew, as I knew he always was very shy and quiet, and even more so as he was a bit shy than Alex.</p> <p>The only thing that made Andrew look at me as more mysterious than Alex was the fact that we were both older than I had ever really been. I had never really known Andrew, as we had only met once or twice at school and it seemed really odd... kind of like having a boyfriend you met on your first date. Andrew must have looked at me as "someone" more orâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
