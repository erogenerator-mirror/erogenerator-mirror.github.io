It meant that a part of her brain still wanted to help her. Something else, however, held her back from wanting to help herself, and so she just stayed put. He might not have believed that she had a "proper" mind, but at least her own was present. He'd never known to be anything but interested in her. Not really. She had an odd self-image. There were times when she felt like that. There were times when she had an air of vulnerability about her. Maybe that was one of the most subtle parts, because it would have bothered him if it hadn't been there.</p> <p>All her other thoughts came down to him, though. The idea that she was "naked," as he was, when they were alone at night. The idea that her breasts were exposed. She had put them on for him. She'd enjoyed that, too. She'd enjoyed being embarrassed. She'd enjoyed that she was being sexy.</p> <p>He tried to think of a way to help her. He was trying to see what she really wanted out of life, to be an actress, a good model. Why was she still wearing clothes? She'd been naked most of her life, and now that she was no longer, the last time she was naked was a few weeks ago, the last time she was in a relationship with someone in the middle of the day. That had been embarrassing, but he had to be patient. He had to try to help her, in more ways than one.</p> <p>But she was already in the middle of it, and he had to try one more time. He had to be patient. He'd been in the middle of it more than a few weeks, but he had nothing to add on.</p> <p>He kept thinking about the idea of her being naked and posing for men, doing things out of character.</p> <p>He turned on his heel and went back toward the bar. He put five bucks on the bar, and looked up. Her head was up, smiling. He smiled back.</p> <p>"You're kidding, right?" her voice came from behind him. "I was totally naked!"</p> <p>He turned. She was smiling. Her body was covered by clothes, and it was very sexy; all she had on was an overcoat. Her breasts pushed up against her dress, forming a perfect point against her skin. Her legs were open enough to be visible, because her knees were closed together. Her breasts were exposed, though they seemed not to be all that exposed. He didn't know whether or not he should look away or just smile, or do something other than look.</p> <p>He couldn't. She leaned over the counter, giving him a full front row of her breasts.</p> <p>"And I'm naked too!"</p> <p>"Sure," he said. It wasn't a joke, though.</p> <p>"No," she said. "Not quite."</p> <p>"Sure."</p> <p>She leaned over him again, leaning over him with her breasts touching him. "You should see them," she smiled, "they're so sexy. I can't wait until I get to have another man at a party."</p> <p>"It's crazy. I think I might have forgotten you are out there alone right now."</p> <p>She pushed her chest forward, and his hands shot out to meet her. She leaned over his lap, straddling him, and held on tightly. His hands went to her hips, and they moved up to her ass. He rubbed his hands on her cheeks, just to tease her a little, to make sure she still had all the nerve to pull him inside her before he gave her any trouble. He rubbed her ass a bit, enjoying the shape of her.</p> <p>"You're looking forward to the party," she said, giving his cock a light squeeze for her own fun.</p> <p>"I am!" he said. He had to smile, though. There was only one way he could get all that sort of effect out of himself. "What the hell are you? That's my name on the front."</p> <p>She laughed. "Don't you remember?"</p> <p>"I suppose," he said. She had a sort of laugh, too. He couldn't recall. What the hell was going on, then?</p> <p>She lowered her head down and kissed him. It wasn't a kiss on the mouth, but an open-mouthed kiss. Their kiss, although brief, felt as if it lasted forever. She pulled away. "I know you can't make up your mind," she said.</p> <p>"You could still just tell me to go," he said.</p> <p>"But I promise you, I'll go when I can't make anything else up."</p> <p>He didn't know how to respond, so he leaned over her as she rose up to the bar, still sitting down on oneâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
