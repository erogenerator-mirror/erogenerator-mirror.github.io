It tasted of the salty tears I'd just had to make my eyes water. I pushed it out of my eyes and held it in my hand thinking if I had to have her inside me I could probably have the same thing.</p> <p>"I can't wait until tomorrow," was all I could think of telling her.</p> <p>"Me neither."</p> <p>"No. But it will be tomorrow after, can't we do something?"</p> <p>"Tomorrow we can, but the rest of the time I'm just going to have breakfast and we'll get to know each other better."</p> <p>"We won't do dinner tonight," her voice was still very timid at mine, "I promise."</p> <p>"Good." I got up to leave again, "I'm going to have to go meet some old friends tomorrow to catch up with some of the things that have happened in the last few days."</p> <p>"I understand." "No, I want you to stay."</p> <p>"So how will we go about this?"</p> <p>"Are you going to keep me here or are we going out and see someone else?" She laughed.</p> <p>"I'm not sure. I have been thinking about that so much I'm just not sure. I have to admit I've thought you might be the perfect person to help me with my writing and you'll be right here all day tomorrow." I started back to the main road, "I'll see you in another thirty minutes."</p> <p>"Goodbye Joe. I'll have you back tomorrow ready to write."</p> <p>"See you tomorrow."</p> <p>"I'll see you tomorrow, bye," I waved as I turned for the next door.</p> <p>After thirty minutes I drove home and stopped in to grab a coffee for lunch. After eating I went to my bedroom and got dressed for what I was planning the next day. I figured being a writer was going to be better than all the other things my old self told me about what being the perfect person means. It meant I could write my best stories and I thought I was going to have to go through that again. With everything that happened to me that day and just the two days ago that followed I couldn't really picture anything else happening.</p> <p>My phone rang a couple of times and with two missed calls I decided to answer it and let it ring a few times. It didn't seem to come to me until I got a voice from my own.</p> <p>"Hi, Joe, there is a problem. I am working through my problem with the new editor of A, but am having difficulty getting the book out of the office tomorrow. Can you come back to help me while I try to get it?" It was my ex, Sam.</p> <p>"Hi Sam. Is Sam here?"</p> <p>"Hello Joe. You'll have to wait and answer the next question of course."</p> <p>"Yes, yes."</p> <p>"Are you my subject?"</p> <p>"Yes, of course."</p> <p>"Have you made plans to go to work on this book?"</p> <p>"No, I haven't planned on that. Actually it's more of a test, you know."</p> <p>"What does Sam think?"</p> <p>"She is definitely in, but can I call you first?"</p> <p>"Sure, Joe," I said as I heard me hang up my phone.</p> <p>I got dressed and headed back to the publisher. Even though Sam would be having to get a job from now on I needed to figure that out because I really didn't want to have to start with the last client because of what happened between Sam and the publisher. I knew she was going to be at work, why didn't she come on up first just to have Sam tell me about it? I sat down at my desk and started working with my next plan. I knew the problem with Sam's problem was there was too much.</p> <p>For the next ten days we didn't talk much. I was busy finishing on the novel I had been working on, Sam was in her study while I was editing the paper, and in her mind I was at least looking at the book and trying to make sense of a potentially dangerous situation.</p> <p>At lunchtime it was easy to walk all the way to the publisher's offices in the opposite side of town, Sam and I were both sitting opposite our desks but we were leaning on hers and she was leaning forward so close to me that I could smell her perfume. When I asked about her and the book she said her parents were back in town and she'd been away for a long time, probably for ten days.</p> <p>When Sam answered her phone on her end I was floored. I didn't think things had gone quite that far, but the next thing I know she was on the phone with the publisher, and I couldnâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
