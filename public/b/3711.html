I hope you've seen some new stuff."</p> <p>"Not really. I've only had her in one setting or another. But that's the first year."</p> <p>"That's good to know. Are your roommates too? I'm a little jealous of both of you."</p> <p>"We are," he smiled and held out his hand, "And none of us will be living the rest of our lives without having sex with the other's spouse."</p> <p>"I didn't know you were such a prude," she giggled, "And it's funny to see how many married couples are like that. In fact, I was in a threesome with the woman from the bar one time but it never turned out exactly what went right because she seemed to just enjoy it. I'll never tire of your company and I promise I'll never tell you how I feel about you until we're absolutely sure our paths have remained."</p> <p>He took her hand and kissed it. She leaned her head back on his shoulder and pressed her cheek against his as she sighed. After a few minutes, she whispered, "I think it's time we went to bed."</p> <p>They quickly undressed each other and headed up the stairs. He was naked. They climbed on the bed and lay on their sides facing each other. They were facing each other's erect penis lying against their stomach. With their fingers still busy on each other's parts, their legs intertwined. She put her hand on his head and pulled him gently to her breast where he sucked and caressed her nipple with his lips and tongue, which brought a small sigh from her body. After several moments of watching each other enjoy themselves, she rolled over and kissed his mouth gently.</p> <p>Suddenly, she got up and straddled him. As she moved over a cock, she pulled back slowly, then took the shaft into her mouth. As the shaft slid easily deeper into her mouth, she continued with the shaft in her hand. She kept taking and putting the shaft deeper and deeper into her mouth, until the head of his cock reached the back of her throat. He moaned appreciatively as she continued to suck and lick him while rubbing his balls with one hand to give them a slight squeeze. When he was as hard as he had been before she released his penis and continued her journey around his crotch, stopping just at each of his muscular legs. Slowly, she rubbed his cock all the way up his body until she got under his cock and started rubbing his balls with one hand before she let him fall out of her mouth. She ran her tongue up his balls on the way back up his body. When he moaned, she continued to lick all around his face. After kissing his eyelids and then his mouth, she rubbed his cock faster as she got even more excited.</p> <p>She kept sucking until about five minutes had passed and then, looking up at him, she asked, "So, were you ready to cum, Brad?"</p> <p>"Ah, hell yes."</p> <p>"Want to watch me swallow when I'm done?"</p> <p>"Oh, yeah, sure."</p> <p>She climbed up and straddled his cock and slowly lowered herself onto it. The shaft went into her easily, but Brad had only a fraction of an inch before she started to fuck backwards, sliding her body over his.</p> <p>"Now it's my turn," she said as she rode him at a slow pace. "Do you like being on top?"</p> <p>"Oh, yeah." His hand caressed her breast. She squeezed it, causing her nipple to harden just before she took it into her mouth and sucked, causing her to gasp. She let his cock slip from her mouth to speak.</p> <p>"I thought you didn't like it. You're fucking huge."</p> <p>She didn't stop riding him. She moved slowly along his cock which slid in and out of her wet pussy, which was coated in her juices. She was getting harder, her muscles tensing and ready to explode.</p> <p>"I thought you wanted this?" she smiled as she sat a little more onto his cock, "Or, 'I thought you thought you wanted me'," she said, lifting and lowering her body slowly, "To be completely in charge of you so soon after two months without it! Now, I want to do something for you." She sat some more and reached both hands down around their cocks so that they met. While she rubbed their balls, she slid off him and knelt in front of him. She grabbed a hand full of his hair and pulled him forward, causing his cock to enter her mouth. She moved to the side and opened her mouth wide. Brad watched as she took his cock to the back of her mouth and wrapped her lips around its tip.
