I'm off to the shops. I'll see you later. Oh, and I love you!"</p> <p>"Oh, God, Ben. I love you too." The woman said, giving him a quick hug and leaving, followed by the sound of her heavy high-heels clacking into the road. And she was gone. She had given him her keys.</p> <p>He lay on the edge of the bed, his body still in sexual turmoil. The woman had given him a key to an apartment building. He knew from experience that that apartment building's number did not extend beyond his apartment. He took a deep breath and tried to shake off the emotions he had come to have. He closed his eyes. What was she going to do? He was a man. He had committed a cardinal sin with his behavior. He felt like the devil himself.</p> <p>He awoke to the smell of coffee and bacon. He felt that a certain level of guilt still existed. He tried to take control of his emotions. He made himself a cup of coffee and went to the bathroom. As he went into the bathroom, there was a note on the toilet. He looked at it. 'Ben,</p> <p>Do you remember what happened the other day? I'll get back to you tomorrow. I just realized that you still can't quite get over last time . You can't help it. Anyway, it's been a great help. The last time I checked, your heart wasn't in the game."</p> <p>"So, what's the plan?" he said.</p> <p>"What the hell is going on with you?" she demanded.</p> <p>"No," he lied. He was not looking forward to any more of this. There was a certain fear in him. "I'm not even sure what to do," he thought to himself.</p> <p>He went through a period of preparation for the following day. The clock in the kitchen started ticking towards 10:30 pm and he was still dressed, except for the white shirt, which he kept on the bed. It was the only thing he had on underneath all day. She walked into his room at 11:30 pm. He felt something was wrong, and decided to leave the room without having to answer his wife, no matter what.</p> <p>She sat down on the edge of his bed. She started to remove the shirt again. "You can't, can't, do that," she said. "I really don't like it. You're such a bastard."</p> <p>He was stunned. He opened his mouth to speak and she shook her head, leaving him no option but to comply. "Why are you still dressed?" he asked. She didn't respond. He went back to the bed. "I guess I'm going to have to put my clothes back on now," he said with a smile. But before he could sit down, the doorbell rang at 1:30 pm. He grabbed his clothes and quickly returned to his position on the edge of the bed.</p> <p>Ben answered the door. It appeared that both his and Jennifer's parents were home. When the door opened, Ben and Jennifer looked as horrified as he had ever seen them. "Oh my God!" was all they could say. But it was hard not to look. He was wearing a blue shirt, but when he saw it he realized that he still had a shirt on. He quickly put it on.</p> <p>"I'll come to the kitchen and help you with this," he said. And he walked away, down the hallway. He put on both his shirt and his own pants, while he continued walking. He couldn't tear his eyes from his wife's body. She looked like she was glowing. She had on her usual short black dress. He had heard earlier that the dress was sleeveless. They were both still wearing black heels, but the fabric looked like it was almost threadbare. The outfit was not as severe as the previous one, but it had been tailored to its specifications and had a very classy feeling about it. It was black with a little bit of lace, but it appeared to have a very classy look to it. It seemed to be designed specifically to show off.</p> <p>He followed Jennifer in to the kitchen, leaving her to fend for herself. He made himself a cup of coffee. He went to the microwave and set the tray down while he sat down around the table. "How'd it go?" he asked as he sipped.</p> <p>He felt his heart sinking into his stomach. "It was very nice. We have many things to talk about," he said. He was a little relieved that he could put this back into his mind but he needed to say something.</p> <p>"What about you?" she asked. "You seemed to like it." He didn't move.</p> <p>"What about you? Why didn't you say anything last timeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
