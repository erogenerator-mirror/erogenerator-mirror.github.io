He knew and he just smiled.</p> <p>"It can be scary."</p> <p>"It can be fun having you around." I replied with a smile.</p> <p>"Hey I'm not doing it." He said quietly.</p> <p>I looked at him in mock anger and said, "You better believe it."</p> <p>My own tone was so full of sarcasm. He just looked at me and smiled. I could hear his tone, but I could not get it out.</p> <p>I was sure that the answer was there but now I wanted it to get even worse.</p> <p>I could hear him swallow then say, "Maybe not after today."</p> <p>I knew that he had not meant it, but I just waited for it.</p> <p>"Why did you say that? Because I am the best friend you've ever had?" I asked.</p> <p>"Yes, but the person you have known since the very first day is dead, right?"</p> <p>I had expected it at this stage, but now I could see what his intention was. His eyes were red and he was breathing hard.</p> <p>"I...I don't know. I am sorry for what I did, I just... I just didn't mean it." He said.</p> <p>"Maybe you're right. Anyway..." I said as I continued to try to find some way to get out the situation without losing him.</p> <p>He had a look of hurt on his face that I knew was not a comfortable way to handle. I could just tell but I really wanted to see it.</p> <p>"Tell you what," I said finally. "I know you're hurting so... I just wanted to be with you for a few days."</p> <p>"Wow. I'm really sorry." He said.</p> <p>"Yeah you can talk to me. You can call me when you're all better." I said with a smile, but the tone on his face was all sarcasm. I felt really bad for him then. When he looked at me with his best friend I felt so sorry for him.</p> <p>My tone was very sarcastic, "But I wouldn't have brought you over if it weren't for that." I said with a grin.</p> <p>He was shocked.</p> <p>"You're right. I'm sorry..." I said.</p> <p>His eyes grew even redder, "You think? You can tell me! Who the hell do you think you are and why did you call me? You don't even care!"</p> <p>I looked at him as I reached into my pocket and pulled out a small packet of tissues and handed him one. "Here, I gave you these."</p> <p>He started to take both. It felt like it took forever to get them all.</p> <p>"They would probably be more comfortable with us naked." I joked.</p> <p>As he handed the tissues to me I said, "It would be like calling a massage therapist. In fact, I didn't do that."</p> <p>"You mean it would be a 'practice massage'?" He asked as he turned to me. He looked at me so intently and it didn't feel like a professional professional. I was worried.</p> <p>"I guess I just... It just doesn't make any sense to me." I replied with a smile.</p> <p>I reached out and grabbed his hand, "Come on, let's go lay down."</p> <p>He gave me a puzzled look. He needed to think clearly. I told him to get in the truck and I'd ride with him. I would leave him to go to bed and get him some stuff.</p> <p>I watched him in the rear view mirror until I was sure he couldn't see anything. Then I closed the door and we walked out to the truck.</p> <p>I got in the truck. He shut the door and sat next to me. I could see him checking the window constantly. I just sat there, but I was sure his eyes had the same thoughts. I was pretty sure that I was smiling because of the way he looked at me while he drove me to the hospital.</p> <p>He had been such a good friend to me. I really wanted to be with him. I knew there was no going back, but then I realized that there is something you don't want to do. Maybe all you want to do is cry and lie. I just nodded. The next time we were in the area I tried to talk to him.</p> <p>I felt like a weight had lifted. Not only was he my friend, but it was also obvious that he would always support me. The whole situation bothered me. He knew exactly what I was thinking. He also knew that I wouldn'tâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
