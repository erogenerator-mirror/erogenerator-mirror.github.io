One of the most incredible dreams that a woman can imagine that the first time she's allowed to experience, the way that the woman who made her fantasies come true had felt the way the woman on stage had felt at the time, the passion that the female stripper had felt at the time that she masturbated herself watching her perform in her fantasies. And then it was like she had been hypnotized into following the instructions of that woman. And then it was like she was having feelings, feelings of lust that she was ashamed of.</p> <p>Her fantasies were the kinds that she used to have to masturbate with a black man in a locker room in her life, or in an outback on the beach. And the stories of all those erotic stories she kept telling herself had made her horny with arousal to some extent. She was a wild woman in her day-to-day life. She loved sex, loved fucking men and women, and loved that she had those feelings of lust and desire and desire again. And then she thought that if she ever wanted this, she could let go of herself, or it'd happen like the stories that had been telling her. She would let go, and not be ashamed of herself. She would give in to the fantasies that brought her pleasure to people she loved.</p> <p>But for now, tonight, she had something else to get off on while she thought about the fantasy. She had been thinking of masturbating for the past four years, just a couple of days ago, and then thinking about it now, but when she was with Mark, it didn't last long. It never had, and so far, the thought had come as a result of a recent experience in that same locker room with the strippers. But in reality, she was imagining things that had never been done before. Tonight, her fantasy was about to be her own. Her own fantasy was about to be what she had felt during her masturbation, to experience something that she knew she would never want to do again.</p> <p>Her eyes were still closed, and she was drifting in the sexual ecstasy of her imagination about tonight. Her hips were thrusting against the air. She was sliding her hand along the fabric of her panties inside out her panties. She could feel herself becoming wet. She pulled her hand back from her cunt and it was soaking up her cum.</p> <p>"Mark?" she said softly.</p> <p>"Hmm?"</p> <p>"Is anyone there?"</p> <p>"Yeah!"</p> <p>"What's up?"</p> <p>"Nothing."</p> <p>"Are you doing anything, baby?" she asked. "Is that what you want to do?" she said, lifting her legs and slipping them off her sneakers. She was stepping out of her panties and then she was pulling her bra down and off her shoulders. They fell with the weight of her panties and onto the floor.</p> <p>Mark looked down at her. She was standing there in front of him completely nude except for her socks from the day before, bare save for a thin, thin black thong that was almost transparently transparent, and clearly outlined her pussy lips beneath.</p> <p>Her dark nipples were standing at attention, and her areola appeared to push out at least half an inch at the bottom of her breast. Her nipples were as hard as rocks, her nipples protruding like little points over the entire area of her breasts that covered her areola entirely under that thin cloth.</p> <p>She was standing in her underwear, the top of her left breast just below one of her areolas. She was wearing very tight, white, bikini panties. Mark thought about her and the image of her when she came into the hotel room, while he waited for her. He thought about her. The images of herself, the feeling of the material against her breast, her nipples pushing against the material as she walked out from the shower, the feel of her nipples growing harder under the material of the bra, the memory of her.</p> <p>Mark couldn't take his eyes off of her. It was her, his wife. But he could see all of her, and he saw the shape of her pussy lips from between her thighs. She was looking at him like she had the same image in his mind. She was as wild as the dream, even if she was just standing there.</p> <p>They had been at that hotel for more than four hours, since it had been 8 am, and now it was just before midnight as they finished their champagne and walked back toward the hotel room. "I have never ever done anything like that before," she said. "I have thought about this, maybe about the reality of it but...I'm not sure."</p> <p>"Maybe I'll take part in something like this at some point," Mark replied, leaning over and giving her a deep kiss instead of a few seconds. "How did that feel?" He asked.</p> <p>"Itâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
