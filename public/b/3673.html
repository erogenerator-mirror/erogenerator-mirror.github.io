I was so wet and hot, wet for someone who I never thought would be there.</p> <p>My nipples hardened and I found out I was soaking wet as I started to rub faster. I started to play with them faster, moving my index finger as deep as I could get it in when he started to pound away. At the other side of the table, I could feel his eyes on me and I could only imagine that this was really getting to him. With my other hand, I pinched my nipple, pulling on it until I felt it stretch. I pulled on it just as the moans started to emanate from my mouth.</p> <p>Then, and I don't know why, I felt an explosion and I bit my lip to prevent myself from crying. I could feel him come in me and I felt a wet finger enter my mouth. As his orgasm subsided, I sat there motionless, as he looked at me. He leaned across the table as I moved my hand to my breasts, feeling me come down from the orgasm and to his.</p> <p>Looking at me, I could not believe how much I loved and wanted to be with him. This guy made me feel different than I have ever felt in my life.</p> <p>"Come back to bed now," he said and as he reached for me, I reached out my hand to him, pulling him up from his chair.</p> <p>I felt my pussy soaking wet and it felt great to feel his eyes looking at me.

I felt his warm body, his skin hard and smooth. His arms holding me, his legs wrapping on mine. His hands resting on my waist as we moved, but no one in the room looked inside, only me, in his arms.</p> <p>We walked slowly past my bed, it was one of those white sheets with a deep cut in the middle, and there was a pillow laid on it so it turned to be a blanket. I could feel his eyes on me.</p> <p>"I wanted to stop by," I told him and we both walked towards my bed. I could not believe the feeling of his hands slowly moving up my leg. He slowly moved his hands up until they rested on my hips, then I felt his warm breath and could clearly feel my pussy and his fingers caressing my wetness.</p> <p>"I'll be careful." He leaned in as I heard him speaking. His touch on my skin could not be described in words. And, as I leaned in toward him, I could feel his tongue licking up my lips, my body and his hands, exploring me, making me feel so alive, so sexy. When he moved slowly between my legs, I took in every sensation. I could have felt some sort of orgasm if he had touched me there, but he could have it, or I could have cum if he let it. So I was aching for him to be with me, and my body had this need that even though it was a dream, I had to have himâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
