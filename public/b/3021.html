He'll go around selling drugs and stuff that'll put the public at ease even more. He said he'll just see the local town and the people around him, because he can't get enough of you. We all told him that you are great, that it's all he wants, and no one wants you anymore."</p> <p>"Do you?" I said, reaching past him to take a handkerchief from my coat pocket. "This feels so good." I wrapped it up in the back of my hand, but there was no need to put it back on, and handed it to him. "I just hope he gets something to use while we're gone," he said, laughing.</p> <p>"Yeah, too late now." Jack continued to dab at the drool from my forehead. "You have to wear a dress. You can't go with that dress. You have to be dressed just like that. You can't go without it for the next few nights," Jack teased.</p> <p>I shrugged. "Not with this one dress. You know what I want," I sighed as I reached behind me to take the dress and put it back inside my coat. I had made a good impression on Jack, not to mention the man in the limo with the huge smile. "Where're we going?" I queried a moment later.</p> <p>"Why don't you go back to the hotel? We can hang with you there for the evening and see just what the fuck is going on here."</p> <p>"The limo is the next one out," Jack suggested. I nodded.</p> <p>"The hotel's in the same place you are, if you want to go back and change in there," he added. I raised an eyebrow at him.</p> <p>"Oh, yeah. You can have your room here instead," I added. Jack flashed me a pained look and nodded. Just as I hoped. He pulled away from the curb and I almost jumped in the car. In the limo, I felt safer. No one was looking at us. "This isn't like me, Jack," I thought silently, wondering how my day would unfold. In the back, I got down on my hands and knees, and waited. I had no illusions that the limo would come to a stop.</p> <p>I heard Jack's voice as he drove me towards the hotel. I felt a shiver go through me as I was forced to admit out loud to Jack that I was going to be his for the night. I had to do it all if I was going to make it to the hotel on time. "Don't try to keep your word," Jack said, "You don't know what you're going to do. We only got here a half an hour ago. He was going to be here anyway," I heard the limo's horn blaring behind me. My heart started pounding. It was going to be a very busy night, if I kept at it I would probably never leave the limo. As soon as the limo got out of the driveway and I knew it was about the hundredth time I had to take my dress off, I had to figure out what was going to happen. It was only going to be one night. "Come on," I said over my shoulder. "I'll even get a beer. What do you say?" I wondered aloud.</p> <p>"We can order in another room," my husband Paul chimed in.</p> <p>"You got to be joking," I wondered aloud. I had a thousand dollar bill in the car, for a taxi ride, but I knew Jack was right. "Here, let's both drive."</p> <p>I handed over the business card Jack bought me, and he handed me a twenty. I took a small amount from his hand and tossed it on the top of my dress. "Let's go," I said. We turned right, took one of the bags and headed back to the hotel. I put my arm around Jack's neck and kissed the top of his head. "That was very nice, Mister. It'll do my head good to get some sleep in the morning," I told him as I dropped one hand down to pull his face towards me. When Jack took a big swig of his beer, I leaned in and pressed my lips to his, passionately. He put a hand behind my head, guiding my mouth with his, while he slid his hand down my back. As we continued kissing, I reached down and fumbled inside his pants until I came up with eight or nine inches of hard-on-jumping cock, which I massaged as I pulled back from our kiss.</p> <p>"Wow," Jack sighed again. "You're a lucky man. We're gonna need these."</p> <p>"Why?" I asked. I thought he would do it, butâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
