I was kissing my way down to her clitoris, and after swirling the tip of my tongue around it, took the clitoris between my lips. I held her hips firmly with my hands and began working on my partner. I knew how the clitoris was, and that it was hard to locate it when licked in the vagina; it seemed to be sticking out a good three inches. Her vagina sucked my erection in, then drew me back out again. She continued to kiss me with all the abandon that I had given to her breasts, her hips, mine and also her face. I was kissing and licking all over her face.</p> <p>We had our first orgasm together in front of several other people at a bar. There were not so many people here that we only had to get nude. One of the couples had brought over four couples and we had sat down with our drinks each and ordered the food that was on the island. Several people were already in the bar chatting and the first couple brought his drink and started dancing. Several of them looked at us and we looked away. All of them knew that the "new" couple of whom we had met was a good looking guy.</p> <p>After the fourth dance, I went to the bar and picked up another drink and began the long, slow dance that my body knew from its youth. I had never been to the Caribbean before and I could feel that my heart was racing. I slowly slipped one leg over her and she slid her body against mine. We continued to dance and the other women who had already gone had also begun to dance with us. I was glad that I was wearing a garter belt and because it opened up my cleft with a little better maneuvering. Both of the women were now sitting down as we continued to dance and it looked like it was going to take less time than I had thought it would. I moved my body so that every stroke brought me closer to my partner. She was smiling and looking deeply into my eyes. I looked at her and saw that her nipples were still hard and pointing to the sky. I also noticed that the lips of her vagina were parted slightly when I moved closer to her.</p> <p>I kept moving to catch my partner's eye and saw that we were making eye contact. A few minutes later, she pulled away for a moment and asked me to move away from me. I was getting nervous again because I wondered whether I was going to get to experience another man again.</p> <p>I went into the bedroom to change before going back out onto the stage. All of the girls had already had their turn with me. I took a brief look at all the girls and decided that the one that first moved was the favorite. She was also sitting on the edge of the bed. I walked over to the bed and sat down next to her and started kissing her neck, down to her breasts. The girls started to take their clothes off as I kissed the insides of her thighs and was surprised that her sex looked as good as she had looked last night. She leaned against me and I felt my erection as I had last night when we had sex and noticed that the head of my erection was not very big, but it was hard and very long.</p> <p>I took her left breast in my mouth and lightly nipped it with my teeth. Then I gave her nipple a quick lick. She reached down and grabbed my penis and squeezed it lightly.</p> <p>"Let's have some more fun," she said with a seductive smile.</p> <p>We did a quick round of the bed and again kissed. This time our tongues and lips were even, I think, more passionately. I continued down her body, leaving long wet trails with my tongue inside her vagina. I was still unsure of whom it belonged to and I pulled her to me and we spent a long time in the sixty-nine position. I felt that when we both came together and started to move, I was in the middle position from kissing her vagina, and I was in the middle position from my kisses on her thigh and the one that had already gone on earlier.</p> <p>The girls left the room before returning carrying a small bag. I had my penis in my mouth and was sucking it for all I was worth. When a girl would walk in, she would stop and bend down to make a quick adjustment of her panties and then sit back up. The thought of a beautiful nude woman touching me for the first time again was all it took. I was sucking her vaginal opening like it was the best piece of pussy ever. The sensation of it was wonderful. I heard her moan as I licked all over her clitoris, and then slipped a finger inside her vagina. I was not as much of a stranger to eating pussy as she, but the taste was better in my mouth.</p> <p>I decided to ask the girls if they would like to see more of me.
