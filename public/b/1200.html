"I thought you might like it some other time."</p> <p>"No, I would have never gone that far," she said with a laugh. "You just made it all even sexier."</p> <p>"It's what it is," I assured her. "In my experience, a woman's body is always different, depending on what sort of lover she is. As well as being attracted to me, she's always horny when the mood strikes her and her imagination often takes over."</p> <p>"You're serious there," she smiled. "But then, a good looking man who is, well, well, doesn't have the stamina to make her cum."</p> <p>I smiled as I considered whether or not she was actually serious. Maybe we could try it with her later. I liked her just the way she was and I knew I wanted to do it to her all again someday. I leaned over to brush a strand of her hair away from her face as we reached the front door of her apartment. "We're gonna get to know each other, tonight. What do you say?"</p> <p>"Oh, God, I can't believe we already have a threesome," she grinned. "I hope that makes up for not even being in bed with you."</p> <p>"Of course, I'd love for you to experience it again sometime," I assured her as I took her face in my hands and we shared another long, wet, sensual kiss. "And I want you to be sure to let me know when you get a chance to do it again."</p> <p>We walked out together to the reception desk to see the receptionist who greeted us when we arrived at our door. She checked his credit card and smiled as he handed us our card and said, "Oh, that's good," before entering the door. We both smiled as she closed it then said, "Thanks for being open with me, Tim. Hope all that experience can be enjoyed, too."</p> <p>"It's OK, babe," I grinned back. "It's a lot to be getting over. When you get back, I'm in the back parking lot, waiting for your return."</p> <p>"Oh, that'd be great! And what about you?"</p> <p>"Yeah, sure, but I don't really know about sharing you, or even how to handle it," I said as I held the door open for her. "There's a lot of guys who come here. We're just friends with benefits."</p> <p>"Really?"</p> <p>"Yes, really! Don't you worry, Tim. You'll be back. Just give yourself time to think about what you want to do while you can still enjoy the rest of this trip at a leisure."</p> <p>As I closed the door, I leaned over and kissed her. "I've been thinking about this all day. What is it going to be?"</p> <p>"I want you again this weekend. I don't want to wait too much longer."</p> <p>"I don't want to wait too much longer either," I smiled. "Let's get to know each other better."</p> <p>That weekend, we spent the day at our favorite barbeque. We hit the dance floor together, danced with some of the girls, and drank a few beers. After several hours of this, our group headed back to her place. We each had our own room, got undressed in the bathroom, and had the place all to ourselves for a few hours. It was fun. I thought my wife might be able to handle anything sexual.</p> <p>Myself, I knew she did, but I knew I wasn't into anything in that department. And when she left, it seemed like a small step.</p> <p>At her apartment, we spent the day getting to know one another as much and more than we already had. I got naked and she did the same. We didn't have sex but we did take care of one another. And we were making love while I watched a movie on TV.</p> <p>The next Saturday afternoon as we were sitting on the couch watching "The Lord of the Rings," she asked me, "So are you interested in becoming a movie star?"</p> <p>I laughed. "Would you let me?"</p> <p>"Hell, yes!" she exclaimed. "And I'd love to see the man of my dreams! And I want that to happen so much!"</p> <p>"Just like you want me!" I responded.</p> <p>"Don't forget, Tim," she smiled. "You don't have to do anything you don't want to do, either."</p> <p>We laughed and laughed. Before the night was through, we'd all made a date for Saturday to come see "The Dark Side," the movie we'd been watching the whole evening. We'd also all been watchingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
