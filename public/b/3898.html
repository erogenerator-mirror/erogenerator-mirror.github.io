"Thanks. That was great."</p> <p>Sophia: I'm going to be leaving the store by 5:30. I can't wait to see you.</p> <p>Sophie: I know, but... I was wondering if we could take your truck...."</p> <p>Me: "Sure, but I'll drive us through the mall. That'd be awesome."</p> <p>Sophia: Are you sure? You don't like driving all the way back by yourself.</p> <p>Me, "Yeah, no, but it's still cold out there. And if it gets too hot, I don't want to wait."</p> <p>Sophia: "I don't doubt you say that. Where are we going?"</p> <p>Me: "I don't know," I replied. I wonder if its raining?"</p> <p>Sophia: "A lot of stuff is flying around."</p> <p>Me: I'm sure it's just us heading home. It's hard for us to even find a parking place.</p> <p>Sophia: "I'm sorry, but we'll have to get inside. Do you want to come with us?"</p> <p>Me: "You're really nice to me, Sophie. You're really sweet to me."</p> <p>Sophia: "It's been so long, I could only imagine what it would be like to be with you."</p> <p>Me: "Yeah, you can be my girl. We can take a little time together."</p> <p>Sophia: "Well... I've only ever had boyfriends before I got caught smoking. I wouldn't want to tell anyone what I did."</p> <p>Me: "What about when you went to see your mother. Did it hurt or something?"</p> <p>Sophia: "I don't know. She seemed nice."</p> <p>Me: "Well, I was only watching. I really didn't have any problem going with you. But when you walked up to the counter, she looked like she had the world's largest cock in her hand."</p> <p>Sophia: "Ohhhh wow. She really knows how to control a room at the same time."</p> <p>She looked down at her own hand and then up at me. She had the most gorgeous lips I had ever seen. Her dark eyes looked at me for a while before she broke into a dazzling smile. She looked so sweet.</p> <p>We were in the middle of a mall, in a small market section of a grocery store. She was wearing a pair of jeans and a tight white t-shirt. Her legs were bare, in fact my legs looked fine. She was gorgeous!</p> <p>I couldn't hold back for Sophie, I had to see her in person!</p> <p>We had been browsing for hours, and we couldn't keep our hands off each other.</p> <p>Sophia: "I know this may be a bit awkward, but I just couldn't help myself. I could tell that you were staring at me.... Ohhhh." My hand was already rubbing her thigh. She turned around and faced me.</p> <p>Sophia spoke as she ran her fingers over mine. "We should try looking for a place that we'll both like. I think we can find a store close to work..."</p> <p>Sophia: "You're cute with your thoughts!"</p> <p>Sophia put both of her arms around me and began to pull my body close to hers. I let my tongue slowly creep in between her lips. We shared a smile. We kissed for about a minute, before she began to move against me.. Her nipples were now rubbing against my chest.</p> <p>"Is that too much?" I whispered into her ear and felt the heat of her sex begin to radiate.</p> <p>Sophia: "No, no. Just kiss me, sweetheart." She began to move against me more.</p> <p>Sophia: "Are you cold?"</p> <p>Sophia: "No, not at all. Where were we?"</p> <p>Sophia: "You were touching me, you naughty girl!"</p> <p>Sophia began to caress my cock through my jeans. God, that felt so good to me, to have something else touch me. "I have a bit more to go if it gets too cold," I said between kisses.</p> <p>Sophia: *hugs* "Why don't you put that up here?" She grabbed a couple of things and got out a cart. We looked at it brieflyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
