He had a long neck, I thought, as he gently squeezed his jaw. He looked amazing, I thought as I looked him up and down, and was suddenly grateful that I bought a new t-shirt today.</p> <p>"Thank you," he said, almost bashfully.</p> <p>"You're sweet," I said, and leaned over and gave him one the most sensual little hugs I can ever say, and then turned and kissed his cheek, making sure to let the sides of my lips brush against his. He was so happy. Then, the rest happened. I'd forgotten to turn the water on and in time for him to finish his shower and I slipped into the shower with him.</p> <p>I'm sure it was the same feeling as with our first kiss, but it seemed so different. I wanted to hold him and make loving love to him like I'd just done it the first time, for the first time with a man. I wasn't feeling that old, I was still in my 20's. I loved this man, and I really, really enjoyed the touch, the affection, of another man.</p> <p>It was a very slow and tender shower. I never really stopped thinking of that first time, and of the time we'd spent together as lovers, and of the day we'd just finished, as my mind wandered toward that first romantic kiss. Of course, this is a story that only happens to me, so there aren't any other stories for you now either. :)â€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
