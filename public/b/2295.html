Lola said.</p> <p>"Oh! No?" I looked into your eyes, wondering if I was talking about it with a boy.</p> <p>You smiled.</p> <p>"Yes, I'm here with you and nothing more."</p> <p>"I'm going to be late for school." I said.</p> <p>"It's still early." Lola said.</p> <p>"It's still early." I said.</p> <p>And with that, we kissed again, longer and deeper.</p> <p>It was wonderful.</p> <p>"I just want to stay here forever." I said.</p> <p>"You need to keep practicing." Lola chuckled, still holding my hand.</p> <p>It was so hot and we kissed so long.</p> <p>We kissed some more, before kissing again.</p> <p>"Do you want anything to eat or drink?" Lola asked.</p> <p>"Oh, thank you."</p> <p>"No, not right this minute, I'm still just going to finish showering and getting ready to go home." Lola said.</p> <p>"No, I don't want to eat too much right now. I'm going to do some shopping."</p> <p>"OK." I said, wanting you to make the dinner.</p> <p>"I'll go on the treadmill." Lola said, as she got off the treadmill and walked into the bathroom, giving me a little wave.</p> <p>"I'll just go get my purse, I'll take yours out when I'm out in the hallway."</p> <p>"You're such a nice young lady, so sweet and I love the way you blush." With that, she walked out of the bathroom, her soft, warm, warm butt swaying as she did.</p> <p>I was so wrapped up in my shower that I was just about to go downstairs when you joined me, but instead, I heard your voice.</p> <p>"Where are you two going?" I heard you say. In fact, I couldn't have made a more out of it, your voice was just so good.</p> <p>I couldn't have given a rat's tail if anything had happened.</p> <p>"I'll go upstairs in the bedroom, I feel like eating."</p> <p>I could hear you chuckling as we walked up the stairs.</p> <p>"I think we better get upstairs so we can have some fun."</p> <p>"Sure, we'll be down in a moment." I said, but you didn't move. I stopped a little ways down in the hallway, and leaned on the door.</p> <p>"I feel better. Are you happy?" I asked, wondering why I felt this way.</p> <p>"I'm happy. And I'll be feeling a lot happier when we get home." You said</p> <p>"OK."</p> <p>We kissed again, before I pushed you against the door.</p> <p>We kissed more, until we were both panting for breath.</p> <p>"I don't want to leave you alone, if that's what you want." Lola said.</p> <p>"No, not right now we're more in the moment." I said, and kissed your neck, moving to your ear.</p> <p>"I'll be right back, don't go." You said, and walked into the bathroom.</p> <p>I followed, taking your hand and leading you in there.</p> <p>"Let's get this shower going, it'll give us time to clean up before you go." I said.</p> <p>"OK." You said.</p> <p>We got the shower going, but soon the water was running cold, and we washed each other down, turning each other around and doing the same thing.</p> <p>Our kissing was even more wonderful as we washed each other.</p> <p>Eventually you let go of my hand and we dried each other off.</p> <p>We got back in bed together, kissing and fondling until we both climaxed.</p> <p>"Wow." I said as we fell out of sleep and back into sleep.</p> <p>Lola:</p> <p>The next day was a lot of fun.</p> <p>You know what it is like growing old, I'm just glad to be rid of my burden.</p> <p>You're all grown up right now anyway, even if you still don't fully understand what the term "old" really means.</p> <p>I can't really say that I'm ready to admit that to anyone, but I can say that Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
