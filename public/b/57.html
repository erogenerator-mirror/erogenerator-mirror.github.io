Do you always go on your way when I visit?”</p> <p>She smiled and said. “I do know you well. It’s ok. If you want to come over now, I’m here…and you can sleep in the back of the truck or on top of the tent. I’ll drive.”</p> <p>She had such a friendly and trusting smile when she said that. I felt as if I had just run a marathon.</p> <p>“I don’t want a man…Not that guy.” I told her with a smile.</p> <p>“Oh, it’s ok. I like him a lot.” She told me with the one eyebrow cocked. She was giving me something else, and I wanted to ask her.</p> <p>“If you don’t want me to sleep in the back of a truck I don’t mind. I can ride up beside you on my truck.” I said. I could see that she wanted to play right now and then.</p> <p>“Don’t worry about that…I have all my life.” She said with a smile.</p> <p>“You have my back.” I told her with a huge smile.</p> <p>“Oh, don’t worry. I’m glad you don’t want to sleep in a bed on a truck.”</p> <p>I could see that she had an idea. She’s not too bad in the sack, and I could hardly wait to get rid of her. I had to admit this was nice.</p> <p>“Thank you.” I said with a big smile. She walked over to me and hugged me. She hugged me a little tighter than she did the other day. It felt natural. Now, I don’t want to be an ass, but I couldn’t imagine her standing at my shoulder. She was so nice…and all that stuff is making me feel good.</p> <p>We walked up to her truck, and she helped me get into the truck. It was warm and comfortable, and she put her foot up on the gas. She grabbed my arm and looked me in the eyes.</p> <p>“How much time do you have?”</p> <p>I smiled and told her. “You go ahead.” She told me.</p> <p>“It’s not too far. I have to get through the tents now, which is a lot sooner than I thought.”</p> <p>“Don’t worry….This is so warm for me.” I said.</p> <p>“I’m not afraid of the cold” She told me, which was strange as I only live two miles away from the camp.</p> <p>We were both silent when we got on her truck. As soon as I started the engine, all I thought about was how she would look in a pair of jeans and a soft sleeveless top.</p> <p>We turned on the highway, and she gave me another kiss. We talked as we drove. It was easy to do. This conversation didn’t go too far, and I enjoyed it. After a few miles I asked her. “So…do you want to fuck me?” I asked.</p> <p>“Sure. What do you want?”</p> <p>She asked me to let her get on the couch, and put her ass on one of the cushions. I watched intently as she sat down, and pulled her legs up. She started to make it look like she wasn’t wearing any panties. Her pussy was completely bare. I didn’t get a good look between her legs.</p> <p>“Take your top off. I like the way the shirt looks.” I told her, trying my best to keep from looking up the shirt. She smiled back at me and then pulled down her shirt all the way so I had a clear view of her breasts and nipples.</p> <p>She reached back, unclasped her bra and slowly pulled it off so the straps slipped off her shoulders. She let it fall to the ground. She smiled at me as she unzipped the waist band of her jeans. She turned to show me her perfect ass.
