What do you want?" My own question was a bit vague, but in the heat of battle and the heat of the moment, there was little point in being coy.</p> <p>"Yes, this is all so exciting, but we can always wait." I grinned, even more than before.</p> <p>"You're not going to fuck my ass again, right?" There was the slightest hint of sarcasm in his tone.</p> <p>"No. I've enjoyed it, and I'm not going to stop anytime soon."</p> <p>"Oh? Is your ass always in the air?"</p> <p>"No. This is not going to be a routine." He reached out with his hand and I felt his fingertips brush over my ass, and then slide under mine. I felt the touch of another man, and it was all I could do to continue to keep the conversation going. His hands were gentle, and I took them inside me.</p> <p>I looked back over my shoulder as he pushed his hand inside me. "Does your ass feel good?"</p> <p>"If you keep doing that, it'll stay in there, but it's really good."</p> <p>"You know, there are other ways to describe it." His fingers brushed lightly over my anus, slowly opening it up and running his fingertip around the opening.</p> <p>"Do you want me to just slip in?" I heard my own voice ask.</p> <p>"No, not really." I didn't know how to respond.</p> <p>"But I love the way it feels," He added. My body responded immediately.</p> <p>I started grinding back against him while his finger moved inside my anus. "If you want one more thing, I'll be able to return the favor."</p> <p>"Don't be silly. I won't hold any surprises in here when I come downstairs with you. And we won't be doing anything to mess around with." I felt his fingers start thrusting their way deeper inside me. I pressed back into him, trying not to be too loud in front of the whole neighborhood. He moved just a bit forward on the couch. He was almost standing beside me, and I was pressing into him.</p> <p>He moved back as I tried to catch his cock in my hand and pull it out of me with my other hand. I let go with it and it bumped against my stomach. "Sorry, it didn't last very long, did it?" I leaned down to kiss him, but he stopped me. "I've wanted to fuck that ass ever since I saw you. And you're not finished yet." I could feel the tautening of his cock against my stomach, and could feel the warmth of his precum glistening on my skin. I raised my hips, and he could tell what I wanted to do. He moved a little to push his cock inside my pussy. I couldn't resist.</p> <p>He slipped one arm around me and pressed his cock against my pussy, and moved to slide himself inside. I gasped at the feeling that was the first time my pussy had ever felt the softness of this man's cock. I pushed back against him, enjoying the feeling of it in me. We had known each person for a while, but had never had that happen before. I could feel myself getting wetter as he moved inside of me.</p> <p>I reached down and started rubbing myself while he stroked my pussy. His other hand slid down my back, his fingers brushing over my anus. I stopped him from moving to put his finger there, but only for a moment anyway. This man was so good at finding my most sensitive spots, and I knew I wanted more than one of him in me. I looked over at the couch. My friend had laid naked on the couch. Her legs were up in the air and her pussy and asshole were clearly visible through the open crack between her legs. It was the type of pussy I loved to eat. I could smell how wet I had gotten her and my own pussy. I felt the tingling in my pussy, and a bit of a twitch in my asshole. My legs started shaking and I felt the first orgasm build up.</p> <p>"I'm so close" I groaned. I wanted to pull my legs up and let his cock go into me. I tried to hold on as long, but it was difficult to make myself not yell and moan as my orgasm neared its peak.</p> <p>"Shh..." He whispered as I felt him move away. I leaned back against the couch, gasping, and looked over at my friend. She was completely unashamedly fingering her own pussy, and the look on her face could not have been more intense. "Are you close?" She was back on her knees with a finger deep in her pussy, and was now jerking it in and out of her cunt in front of us. I could tell she was close.</p> <p>I lookedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
