I like being naked for you."</p> <p>He turned to look at me. I took off my t-shirt and laid it over the back of the couch.</p> <p>"Can I take advantage of your naked body," he asked matter of factly.</p> <p>"Please! I'm horny and want you to touch me too."</p> <p>He grabbed the belt and began to tie it. "No, I mean I want you to have lots of free time like this."</p> <p>A slight smile came across my face as his hand went round my waist. "I would like that." He slipped my sweats down and reached around to cup my breasts. My nipples were very hard and felt on fire under his fingertips. He rolled them gently in his thumb as he rubbed his finger on one nipple. His fingertip rubbed back and forth across my hard flesh. His other hand went below the waistband of my shorts and ran the front of his fingers back and forth over my naked skin.</p> <p>"Well what do you think," he asked.</p> <p>"Makes me wetter." I lifted my hips as much as I could to encourage him so he would move his fingers up.</p> <p>"My erection is straining to escape." He lifted his head to look down at my crotch as he ran his finger down the length of my length and began to play with my slit.</p> <p>"Please"</p> <p>"Please what?"</p> <p>"Please finger my pussy."</p> <p>He took his finger and circled my hole with the tip, teasing me a little. "Your pussy? Are you naked for me?" My eyes widened and I nodded.</p> <p>He looked at me and his voice was low, deep and deep. "I think you're ready for me."</p> <p>I reached between my legs and spread them as wide as I could. My head fell back as my body undulated, seeking his touch. "Please" he whispered to me. "Touch me."</p> <p>He ran the tip of his finger down my slit once again as I trembled from the combination of anticipation, anxiety, and sexual frustration. He pushed his finger slowly into the pool of my wetness as I groaned. He ran it around in circles as I lifted my body to meet his as he pushed deeper.</p> <p>"Your pussy tastes so good," he whispered, making my head come up and my eyes roll into the back of my head.</p> <p>"Your finger feels so good inside of me like this." My head rose higher for a second as my hips pushed toward him for more. His finger stroked the tip of my clit as he pushed it deeper into my hole. I was gasping as his finger slid deeper in to my hole. I closed my eyes as an orgasm hit all the harder and faster.</p> <p>"Please"</p> <p>As my climax reached its peak it brought little pleasure at all. I let it go at last just as I heard a car drive by us.</p> <p>"Shoot for me," he whispered.</p> <p>The feeling of him there so close and naked sent me into a haze that I could feel him with every thrust of his finger. I couldn't move, couldn't scream, couldn't make a sound. It was all I could do to keep myself from losing my inhibitions.</p> <p>He reached up and felt his cock through the material of his shorts. He rubbed it in the slickness of my pussy before withdrawing it. He stroked my thighs and buttocks as he stepped aside. The heat of their bodies was overwhelming. I had no idea I could feel so turned on.</p> <p>"Is your cock hard."</p> <p>"Very hard," I replied. "But you are not as naked as your cock."</p> <p>He walked to the door and turned it shut. My eyes widened as I sat for a few seconds to recover and then watched him walk toward the living room.</p> <p>He reached the front door and I stood there taking in the gorgeous sight of his slender form and his broad shoulders and arms. I had always dreamed of being with a man's body on a physical level and I had finally succeeded. My eyes were locked with his eyes as he turned and opened the door.</p> <p>"I want you to touch me," he began.</p> <p>"What?" I asked, as he was pulling down his shorts.</p> <p>"I want you to see your cock," he added.</p> <p>I was speechless as he pulled off the last pieces of garment and laid them over the top of his shorts. The head of his cock had a tiny coating of clear liquid on it and I licked my lips as a tingling sensation hit me. "I want you to touch me," he repeated as his fingers went to the waist of his shorts and worked the fabric to snap at the waist that was left uncovered. "Go for it," he crooned.</p> <p>"Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
