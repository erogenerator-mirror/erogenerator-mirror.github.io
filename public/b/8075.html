"Anything."</p> <p>"Have you ever done this with a girl before?"</p> <p>"Not really," mom said, sounding like an idiot.</p> <p>I knew exactly what she meant; she liked to do it with a girl.</p> <p>"Have you ever even seen one of those," she asked, looking me in the eyes.</p> <p>I didn't answer. I watched her take her seat and smile again.</p> <p>"Do you like sex?" she asked, looking over. "Do you like to fuck?"</p> <p>I didn't answer.</p> <p>"Do you like it in the ass?"</p> <p>"I don't love it in the ass, Miss."</p> <p>"Do people think I'm a lesbian?" I saw her look around. "I know a guy who goes for that shit, doesn't he?" she asked. "I think everyone loves it."</p> <p>"Oh," I said, feeling stupid for taking so long to tell her. "You're right."</p> <p>After leaving the restaurant, I walked her to her car, and we kissed. We kissed like two teenagers with our tongues in each other's mouths. I moved my hand down from her shoulder to her breast. I could feel her trembling. I took her hand in mine and led her to my apartment. She was very nervous. I had never done this with a boy, either of which I didn't know and who wouldn't know where to begin.</p> <p>I opened my apartment door, and she quickly followed. We kissed again when we walked into my bedroom. I walked her to my bed and sat her down, then knelt on the floor and crawled up between her legs. She had to try to get her legs apart so I could see her pussy. I licked her again, then slipped my tongue beneath her hood to find her pussy. She was soaking wet. I moved my tongue up over her clit, then went back down to her pussy, going back and forth across it. She was shaking and squirming now. She was in pain.</p> <p>"What the fuck are you trying to do, John?" she screamed. "Just give me a minute."</p> <p>"Miss?" I heard her whisper. I looked up at her. She was crying and my heart beat stopped. I lowered my head, looking up at her.</p> <p>"What, John? What's going on here?" she asked, her voice rising to a screaming pitch. My eyes went back and forth between her face, her eyes. I could see how much she hated me now. I was starting to believe it. She had to do something, was about to get kicked out of the apartment, and was going to get some kind of a life.</p> <p>"I said what are you doing?" she said. I raised my hand to signal a reply, then lowered it to her pussy again. I moved my lips over her clit again, then slipped my tongue inside as far as I could. I moved it slowly back and forth, pushing it up as far as I could, then pulling back until it got to the back of my mouth. She was shaking and quivering. I could feel her orgasm beginning. I knew she was close to coming. I moved my tongue down and sucked hard on her clit. She groaned and screamed, and then began to scream in ecstasy. My mouth began to hurt just to let her finish, so I let go of her clit, and moved my mouth again to her pussy lips.</p> <p>"Miss, please," she said, trying to push herself off the bed again.</p> <p>"Please, what, Miss. Just go back to my bed, but please, please let me finish in your arms."</p> <p>"Just go back to my bed, John, I don't want to be alone. Please finish what you started in here."</p> <p>I looked up at her, at her hair, her eyes. I moved my mouth back up to her and kissed her.</p> <p>"I don't know why, Miss."</p> <p>"You look like you could use a little rest. Why don't you just lay down and I will go wake you and have a few seconds to kiss you before you get out of bed. I guess you can use the bathroomâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
