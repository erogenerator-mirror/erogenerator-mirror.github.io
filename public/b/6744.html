He thought about a woman who hadn't been laid in a while: he wondered if it was because he'd fucked up for the first time in a week or so, or if the prospect got him hard again to think about.</p> <p>As he drifted off, he realized that he was just beginning to get a little horny, even if it wasn't the sexual excitement he had wanted to feel for years. But now that he found out that it wasn't the sexual excitement. It was the excitement he'd been feeling for years. There was only one way to find out.</p> <p>He started to get up and go to the bathroom for a paper towel and some cold shower gel, but stopped, his mind and heart racing. He wanted to see his beautiful wife naked again, and after what seemed like an eternity to him she was laying out the clothes she'd laid out for him.</p> <p>The bathroom door opened and he heard her say hello as he came out of the bathroom. Then the bedroom door opened and she let him in.</p> <p>"What do I do now?" he asked himself.</p> <p>He picked up his clothes and sat on the toilet, thinking that it probably sounded a lot different now, but the thought, or the smell of it, had him up so he could take care of himself without having to think about it. The bathroom light came on and it was back on again; his eyes could make out the outline of her body as she lay on the bed, still naked and still wet and splayed out.</p> <p>He remembered seeing her naked once when she came over and sat beside him, the same look of lust and desire there. But he didn't even think about making this last. He remembered that she knew and so she did what she wanted. He took his time getting dressed and he just stood for a bit, watching his wife naked as she laid there, her legs parted and arms above hers, her breasts rising and falling, the nipples hard little nubs, her breathing ragged and shallow. He thought for a moment that he might be able to get hard again; it would feel good. He started to turn around and walk outside to get some paper towels, but decided against it, at least for now. He stopped and stood watching his wife, as if for the first time the day before, standing naked and vulnerable in the doorway of the bathroom. She had her eyes closed and he could tell that she was thinking the same thing.</p> <p>He pulled on his clothes and as he grabbed the towels, he smiled to himself; the look of love and passion on her face as she stood there, naked and exposed, letting him take her into his arms and look at her.</p> <p>He finished getting dressed, took the last button on his shirt and held it open as he walked out onto the patio and the water started to splash against the patio. As he reached across the glass door with his hand to catch the spray, he felt it on his chest.</p> <p>"Ain't never been in bed with a real man," he thought to himself. The feeling didn't bother him at all; in fact, it thrilled him to get this sort of attention from his wife. He realized right then that he wanted her again, and he'd do anything for her with it. He looked at his wife, her eyes still closed and his own eyes closed and he felt his cock jump as he was thinking about her. He pulled the towel off just as he heard a knock at the door.</p> <p>He was surprised to see that her body was still warm and wet from her shower and that she was totally nude as always, her nipples were pointing out at him, almost making his cock jump. He was trying to think of a way to keep from making love to her while her had a hard time keeping his cock in check. They'd fucked, fucked and fucked with no hurry or satisfaction just in the past few hours.</p> <p>"Come on in, we'll save the hard way," he heard his wife call out.</p> <p>He got a big grin on his face. He walked across the patio and sat down on a towel, his back against the railing, his arms in front of him, his legs up in the air.</p> <p>He heard her knock on the door again, but didn't really hear it. She opened the door and asked, "Do you mind, you dirty old man, don't you think you could help?"</p> <p>As she started to walk toward him he said, "Hell no; if that's what your husband wants I wouldn't ask you. I want you."</p> <p>She smiled at him and then stepped inside as he held his arms open. She smiled more broadly as she stood in front of him in her heels, with her arms across his chest to keep herself from falling. Her nipples were pointingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
