I was still holding the towel tight around my waist when I heard the bell ring. It was late afternoon; and I heard a light rap on the door. My heart raced at the prospect of this young man being there in my bed. A few seconds later, a warm hand brushed my cheek. There would be no more play.</p> <p>"I am on duty tonight," the young man announced as he slid the towel from my slim body and let it drop to the floor. He moved up to me, kissing my lips on my mouth again, his tongue sliding over mine. When his hand reached out to cup my breast, I felt as though we were on fire. His fingers closed around my nipple, pinching it firmly. "Oh, baby," he groaned against my face. "I always know that no matter how many times we make love, I always end up dreaming of what you could make me feel like when you were ready."</p> <p>The fingers on his hand found my aching nipple, pressing hard and firmly. My hips lifted in response, inviting him to take me. He was not gentle, pushing me against the wall while his mouth moved down to my neck, sucking and nibbling as he moved his hand to my other breast. The hand in mine was gentle, but firm as an expert. When the gentle, gentle touches left my breasts, his hand moved up my body to cup mine. Feeling her warm, soft body was like touching a flame. I wanted to move my body so I could share the experience. But I didn't. Instead, my legs opened, inviting him to move.</p> <p>Our lips parted, our breath quick. Our bodies moved together in slow, sensual circles. My heart was pounding against my chest, with my knees weak.</p> <p>He took the hand holding mine and pressed it to the side of my head, directing it to the side of my body. We locked eyes for a moment, our lips moving closer. His tongue moved toward my mouth, probing softly. I opened to him, yielding to his touch. The sensation of his tongue moved to my collarbone. His hand traced the curve of my breast to the underside of my breast. He moved to the top of my breast, pressing his thumb lightly across my nipple. I could feel it tingle against his palm.</p> <p>The finger moved to my navel and pressed lower, dipping down to tease my bellybutton. His thumb moved to the bottom of my clit and tickled it, moving around the opening. His hand cupped my thigh and moved it upward, between my legs. He moved his fingers to touch my lips, parting my moist folds. I felt him moving upward from my belly button to my breasts, stroking each nipple. The other hand moved to my hips, pressing my lips toward his. It was at that moment that I realized there was only one thing that I wanted at this moment. In one smooth, fluid move, I wrapped my legs around his waist and lifted my hips. He pressed my body down against the wall as his lips found mine.</p> <p>My hands went to his shoulders, pressing him against me as their tongues danced together. My body felt a powerful, primitive urge as his cock nestled itself over my swollen lips. He moved his hips to slide his cock inside of me, his cock slowly moving up and down over my swollen lips.</p> <p>"Oh, yes," I whispered when the head of his cock reached my slit, "just let it slide inside." His hips began a slow movement, filling me in a way I had never felt. My body responded to him as he drew me toward him. My hips moved gently, seeking the rhythm of his hips, urging him to keep pushing. There was no sound in the room other than our breathing.</p> <p>I closed my eyes, letting the world float away as I enjoyed the way that the young man moved inside of me, his hard cock filling me. He stopped moving, waiting for me to tell him to continue. I was ready to tell him to fuck me, but all I could do was let the words come out as I moaned and pushed my hips toward him, meeting the thrust, moaning with him.</p> <p>"Yes," I cried out, "I want it to always be like this." As the tempo and rhythm quickened, I felt his weight on me as I felt his body, like a weight on top of me. I felt a tremendous pressure on my hips, and felt him pressing against my body. Our bodies were moving like waves against a beach. It felt like sparks were flying through both of us. I wanted to move, move with him.</p> <p>"Take me," I begged, "I want you back inside of me." He rose up on his arms, pulling me closer to him. He was moving, moving inside of me. I felt his cockâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
