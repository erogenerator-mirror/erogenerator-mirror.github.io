She looked up and saw him standing there. He stopped for a moment then walked over and stood in front of her. She didn't need him telling her to do something but as she stared at the bulge in his pants she realised she needed to do something. She walked over and knelt down in front of him.</p> <p>"Do you know what it is you like best? Don't tell me you like sucking my cock?" He said confidently.</p> <p>She looked up at his face but saw he wasn't smiling. She knew what he wanted her to do. She undid his flies and pulled the end of his cock out of the fly of his underwear. It sprang up and throbbed. She wrapped her hand around it and with her thumb rubbed the shaft a little. His eyes rolled back in his head as she did so. It had a thick shaft so she ran her other hand along it over the top and down the inside till her fingers touched the side of it. He let a moan escape as her hand moved along it. She put her hand back along it and again she felt his hand on her breast. He was rubbing her breast in circular motions. After a few more seconds he pulled out of his boxer and she could feel his member rubbing against her leg.</p> <p>Without breaking her gaze she looked up and saw him smiling down at her. She looked down at his cock standing up. He looked her dead in the eye and then quickly slapped her bare thigh under her skirt. She gasped loudly at this and grabbed the skirt in both hands and tried to pull it down. He laughed as he saw the red satin on her leg and lifted it off, revealing her pink silk panties. He looked her right in the eye and she felt as if he had turned her a shade of red but the look in his eyes was intense and as her eyes returned to his lust filled stare she could feel the heat rise in her. It was the first time she had looked more closely up to this point but she felt she had been aching to taste him.</p> <p>He stared at her exposed legs and then leant forward so he was almost in her face. She leaned in towards him and tried to lick and taste him but it was hard not to gag as he had her tongue completely pinned under it's own weight. She was too tight and he could feel every muscle in her body tensing as with one hand he grasped her thigh and pulled her body to him. He slid his tongue deep into her hot mouth as he reached round and pulled the elastic over her pussy. Her whole body tingled as the wet heat of the underwear covered her pussy.</p> <p>He licked her lips then gently moved them apart. He let the tip of his tongue slide down her slit and then ran it along her lips. He then pushed her legs higher and started to kiss her thighs. Her legs quivered as her heart raced, but she felt that this was the first time he had done this. He moved her legs up to where her head was at his crotch. He pulled her to him and she looked up at him with a desperate look. That was the only time he had seen the look of lust he had in her eyes. He ran his hands over her naked smooth skin and ran his thumb over her clit causing her to moan. He grabbed her hips and turned her sideways so that she was facing him. He started to ease his cock between her legs but she stopped him.</p> <p>"Wait," she said. "I really need to take a shower."</p> <p>"You need to, you naughty girl!" was all he was going to say. He pulled her gently against him and kissed her face.</p> <p>"Not even a kiss? There's not much more you can do, is there?" she asked as he lifted her hair back from her face.</p> <p>"Well, you see, you're being naughty. I've decided to take a shower before I change, you want to do it with me?"</p> <p>"That's an offer I cannot refuse, I want to try and enjoy your body." He said as he let her hair go.</p> <p>He pulled her down on the sofa chair and sat next to her and began unbuttoning his shirt. He slid his trousers down a little with each button until he was sitting facing her. He reached between his legs and grabbed his cock.</p> <p>"Get back there," He said as he moved his head towards her.</p> <p>She looked up towards his face then looked at him.</p> <p>"You can have it then, I want you now." She said as she opened her mouth. She couldn't believe how it felt to open her mouth to him and take his cock inside. She closed her mouth all the way around it's length. She could still taste the blood on it. She knew it was the result of her own excitement and could feel it pulsingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
