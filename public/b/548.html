"What time is your flight?"</p> <p>"It's not for an hour or two, I'm going to be late for work," he lied.</p> <p>"I'll make you breakfast, honey...but don't let anything I do or say in the future change your mind." I kissed him on the cheek and got right on the plane.</p> <p>I knew that Jack's job was going to require a huge amount of time and effort. Since no one was at the counter at that precise hour the next day, I was going to have to make my own breakfast.</p> <p>I made sure Jack had a good breakfast that looked exactly like what he'd left for me the night before. And I also ordered some bacon, eggs, sausage, and hash browns.</p> <p>I was going to need something to eat, so I made sure that when I heard my boss coming in the dining room and saw him sitting there, I knew that this would be a big day. A big day for the both of us.</p> <p>I took a few sips of coffee and sat down to eat my breakfast. "I'm sure that I won't be able to leave the two of us alone for a while, will I? Don't you ever take the time to think about what you need to say to me?" I smiled, and then told him the situation that had occurred the night before.</p> <p>Jack looked so happy that I didn't feel bad for what I was about to do. He told me that he was so excited about my plan that he couldn't get me to sit down on his lap in the chair he was sitting in. But as I sat down, my dress rode up. I got a better look at his crotch. Not only did he get an erection that he wasn't used to, but it was getting wet all over. I sat back up and gave him a smile, and told him I didn't want to hear his silly jokes anymore. I knew that in a minute he would be in love with that part of my body.</p> <p>A few moments later I was up and dressed to get Jack. We had made plans to make love the night before. Jack helped me dress for once and I kissed him on the cheek and gave him a hug in the elevator.</p> <p>We had breakfast in the same restaurant and I was amazed that everything I was told to not wear was this way. It also made sense to me, since Jack didn't seem to mind the dress as much. I also took the time to make sure that the makeup was the same as the evening before.</p> <p>Jack sat there when I asked him to go with me for a walk on the way to my home. It was an interesting night. He seemed genuinely happy to be able to come to my door. He looked really happy to be going. He looked really happy when I offered to take him home and drive him back to my house.</p> <p>I got us both a blanket wrapped around our waists, and Jack got me a set of keys that I could call a taxi on my phone.</p> <p>When we got to my house he didn't say anything to me. He simply looked into my face and looked as though he knew what I was thinking about. He looked as though he wasn't sure how I felt about that. But my heart kind of went out to him. Our life was really getting better. He loved everything that he did. He didn't want to have anything like that happen again. I just couldn't do it.</p> <p>When we got to my house, I took him inside and took him in my arms and laid him on his back on my kitchen counter. I turned out the lights and set the table for us. I had him lay out on his back and I stripped and got out of my dress. It took a moment for him to notice that as I slowly removed all my clothes, my breasts came into contact with his chest hair. When I started to get ready to put my underwear on, I sat next to him, and slowly slid my panties down one leg and then the other, watching his eyes follow my underwear.</p> <p>I finally got my panties off and put on a matching bra and panties and sat over his lap and watched his eyes drink in the sight of my naked body. I don't know how long we sat there, but I was getting really turned on. I was rubbing his stomach and his arms were moving around my waist. His body felt so nice. "Do you like what you see?" I whispered as I ran my fingers over his jaw, just above his eyes, just below his chin.</p> <p>We sat there for a minute just looking around at each other. We started to kiss and when I started to feel something warm on my leg, I looked up to see Jack's face. He was grinning at me and he told me, "You're a really nice girlâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
