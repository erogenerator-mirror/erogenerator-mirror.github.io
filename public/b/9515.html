"Please...don't do this."</p> <p>"I can't. You can say whatever to make me stop." She took her finger away from me. "I'll be gone for hours." She lifted her foot up and off the floor and walked back over to the bed laying flat on her back, her eyes pleading with me to do more.</p> <p>I knelt down next to her. "I'm not going to use that knife again." I held the knife out to her.</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"It's a friend of mine," I said as calmly as I could.</p> <p>"No, it didn't hurt that much. We were together for a long time, and now it's time to get out of here." Her whole body was shaking with pain.</p> <p>"No, we're not going," I said. "I just don't want anything from you again. I've never felt so helpless in my life."</p> <p>"I want you," she said softly.</p> <p>"Me too," I returned. "I just don't feel safe being alone together like this."</p> <p>"We got you, you know," she said, taking my hand and leading me into the room.</p> <p>"No," I said quickly, but I could see that she wasn't letting go of my hand. Her eyes were wild with desire. "I didn't mean to. And if you want me here," I said, gesturing at myself, "you're going."</p> <p>"No, I want you," she said, standing and stepping close to me. "I want us to play." She kissed me and held my hand as I stepped closer to her. She ran her fingers through my hair and caressed my face. I loved the way she held my hand.</p> <p>I started walking with her leading me toward the bed. I looked back at her as I took a step, and she grabbed my arm. "Get on your back, you little slut." She turned me toward the bed, and I lay down in the middle of it, my eyes closed, still not letting go of her hand. She climbed onto the bed and straddled me in the same sitting position she used to kneel at one of my favorite places. My hands were shaking and I was starting to sweat from the anxiety.</p> <p>"You have to look like that, you asshole," she laughed. She grabbed a pillow from the foot of the bed and threw it under my face. "Get that mouth open and get that tongue going." She climbed onto my chest with me on top. She placed her hands on my shoulders and lay down so that my face was right in front of her breasts. My cock was rock hard and I was so turned on by this woman that I couldn't stop myself.</p> <p>"Come on, come on." I said, but I stopped just as a drop of precum emerged from the tip of my cock, running down it and over my balls. I moved forward a little at a time until I felt her tongue lick it. "That's it, suck on your wife's tits, you idiot," she mocked me. It just felt like that.</p> <p>She ran her tongue around her left breast slowly, moving up to her right. "I'm going to suck on your nipples, too." She took one of her nipples in her mouth and let the nipple grow and stand out as she sucked the whole thing. Both of my hands were shaking now and my palms were sweaty and red. I could feel the wet spot on my shorts sticking to me.</p> <p>I couldn't believe the reaction I was getting. I was really surprised that I could stand. Even though I'd never had anything this hot in my whole life, I felt like I was in paradise.</p> <p>She sat up as far away from my face as she could, resting her forehead on my chest. "Don't worry, honey, you're not the only one who needs a man right now," she said, putting her head back down. She was still leaning over me so that her breasts were touching my chest.</p> <p>"What does this have to do with this?" I asked.</p> <p>"Nothing, really. Now open your legs a little and I'll sit back and let you play with your cunt." She climbed away from me and lay down on the bed once again. This time she reached down with her hand and brought my cock up to her waiting hole.</p> <p>"Oh yeah, come on in," she giggled as she pulled me down for a kiss. "Come on, baby, you're about to get one of my friends to lick your pussy for you!"</p> <p>I was almost too excited to care about the thought, but Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
