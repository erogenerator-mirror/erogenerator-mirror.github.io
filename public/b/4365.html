"I will not be gentle - I will not stop the passion and your desire in me as you need to be. I will just use the moment I give you this orgasm to make you want me more and more."</p> <p>Then he released her nipples from his caresses and slipped his hand inside her panties, her body responding to his touch as she had done to him, she arched her hips and pushed back and her breasts brushed against his arm. Her body shook and her mouth opened and closed over his as she pulled her mouth away. Her body shook and quivered again, a tremble she had never felt before and she could feel her body being lifted from the bed, she could feel him standing naked beside the bed with his hand inside her panties, his fingers exploring her wet flesh and feeling her tremble with anticipation. She could feel his arm moving her panties gently down her legs, slipping them gently to the floor as her legs moved and as he slipped them off and he turned her around to look at her.</p> <p>His eyes roved over her body slowly as he spoke to her... "I want you to be mine and to know your body as best you can with me."</p> <p>His hands touched her hips as she felt him lift her, she almost dropped, and the feel of his muscular body moving across her felt heavenly and exciting. As he lifted her she felt the bedding slip away to give the end of his shaft room to enter her. And then he was there and in her and in her - and she was so wet, he had to move his position slightly as his hardness moved inside her and she felt him slide himself slowly into her and it was like the first time it had been a few months ago when she had first felt the length of him inside her.</p> <p>She felt his legs part her and her body arched as he pushed himself down and his erection was enveloped by her wetness. Her muscles contracted as he moved inside her and the sensation was wonderful and she began pressing her body back.</p> <p>"Ohhh..." he whispered and he stopped only to push himself further inside and then back out again a little more. She wanted this as much as he wanted. He wanted to take her in an animalistic way, to show her who she was now. Then he paused again, allowing her body to respond again and she could feel his erection move back and forth inside her and she could tell that both of them wanted just this to be their very first time.</p> <p>"Is that what you want?" she asked him and he just grinned at her and nodded.</p> <p>"I want you to be my mate!"</p> <p>He thrust himself down into her again and she closed her eyes and arched her back again, his hardness sliding as deep inside her as it would go and her own body started to respond as well.</p> <p>"Ohhh," she whispered, she heard herself saying.</p> <p>"Yes," he breathed. "I want you as my mate!" He pushed in fully again and she felt him begin moving slowly in her again and then he slid out, sliding the tip of his erection back inside her and then just slipped into her until she realised that he wanted her to tighten her whole body and hold him there. He needed to be in her to make it happen and she had no problems doing that. Her whole body was in his power now and he felt her body move with him, the feeling was sensational as her breathing had increased and he started to move with her more and the sensation in her body added to the pleasure.</p> <p>"Yes, yes, yes... " she cried each time she felt his shaft move inside her. "Yes, it feels so good."</p> <p>"I like it when you do that, to just hold me, and to just hold on to me" he murmured into the darkness.</p> <p>"Can I?" she asked.</p> <p>"Of course."</p> <p>He slid up and then pushed in, her muscles tightening around him as she felt his shaft enter her body, his movements were slow at first and a little more frantic but she felt her whole body respond and she wanted more. She opened her eyes and looked at him as he continued to move inside her and she was overwhelmed by the sight of his shaft as it slid through her and into her body. He was so gorgeous, her body felt alive, but she felt him close inside her as her walls contracted and her whole body responded.</p> <p>"Ohh! Ohh," she cried as he held there, he had made her feel like this and her body responded to him as deeply as it had to the feeling that he was moving within her.</p> <p>"Yes," he said. She felt he had not yet come and he was moving inside her slowly now and felt her body respond to him more firmly. She felt him move in the darkness and she could feel him moving within herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
