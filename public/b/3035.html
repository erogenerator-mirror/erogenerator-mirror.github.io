I can't believe that you did it with that guy you were with last Friday. What are you thinking, my brother?"</p> <p>"He was my first, you understand?"</p> <p>"Yes, because he was your first. I am glad I didn't have any trouble making you happy."</p> <p>"I have always liked you, Dan. And I like you too. I have to admit I would have liked to have had you as my first, but it was you. How would you like me, to be on top? I mean, you know how I was looking at you."</p> <p>"It would surprise me, you know."</p> <p>"I wouldn't be surprised. We have known each other all of our lives. We have known each other for as long as we did. And it wouldn't be as if we both had a second date. We weren't going to rush things, but we needed this. You wouldn't feel like an insecure virgin being on my arm, but I couldn't make you. I mean it wasn't until you admitted to it that you were interested in me. Maybe you knew you were a good looking first? Maybe you did, but I'm not so sure I wanted to jump your bones."</p> <p>"Why on earth should I?"</p> <p>She looked at him. "Because I like getting your cock in my mouth, too. Would you like to see it?"</p> <p>I stood up. "Dan, we don't have all night. Let's go to the couch and you can take care of me, and I'll show you what I like."</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>"Okay, baby. We can take one or two shots of rum and pop at the arcade. Why don't you get your shirt off so we can try it out?"</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>He got down on his knee's and looked at her. "We haven't eaten yet, so my food is probably good. If you want to play, I'm all out. We can go to some of the bars that you know. We can have a great romp when we get back to the house."</p> <p>"Yeah, I'm up for it."</p> <p>She took a deep breath and went into my bedroom. She came back a moment later with a t-shirt and a pair of shorts. She put the shorts on but they were not as snug as she had hoped, and got into my shorts.</p> <p>"You can change. We can meet in the lobby for some coffee. If you prefer something else. We'll save us that embarrassment."</p> <p>"Don't worry about that. You won't be a virgin the rest of the summer. I'll have a roommate who doesn't want a virgin."</p> <p>"You can ask me to come down, too. We can hang out in bed later, or come back up here for a little. Whatever you want. Just give it to me."</p> <p>He looked at the shorts a moment, then got dressed.</p> <p>We went back to the couch. "Dan, I want it too."</p> <p>He nodded and got under the sheets. "We can see about that."</p> <p>When we heard the elevator door opening, he got out, came over to the couch, and sat down. I sat down next to him.</p> <p>"Dan, I just want to tell you and tell you I've been thinking about this for a long time. I've just had a lot of time to try it out with you. This is really not what I planned on, but it's what I've always wanted."</p> <p>"Oh? What have you always wanted, then?"</p> <p>"Me, too, you."</p> <p>His arm went around me, and he brought me to him. I was in his arms. I knew that this wasn't the first time I'd wanted it, but it was the first time I felt like I wanted it. We were so close. We both had our hands in each other's pockets and I could feel and hear the excitement in his voice. It was hard for me not to cry with happiness, but I didn't need to. He kissed me on top of the head and told me he wanted me to do this. I was glad to hear that and happy because it was the final straw. After a few seconds of holding each other, we both burst out crying, and I told him how much I wanted him, and he promised never to say the word "No".</p> <p>We laughed a little, kissed some more, and fell off to sleep, me snuggled up to him as close as I could get. I felt so safe and loved, and I knew that his love to me made him happy. When we were ready, we got out of bed, went out to the elevator and went down to Dan's apartment, where we met all the friends that were waiting. We kissedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
