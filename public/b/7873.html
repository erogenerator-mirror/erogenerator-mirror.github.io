I am done with this game. I will do what ever it is to leave him. He can never love me. It was all a misunderstanding when he was a kid. He has never said anything to me. Maybe it is because he thinks I am no longer alive. Maybe not but there is something wrong with him. A small part of me has the desire to be loved and have that love that he has lost."</p> <p>I am not surprised by the change in her. It was more of a conscious choice than an act of weakness. She just needed something that he could not.</p> <p>"Maybe I am wrong, but you were not wrong." I said as I picked up my cell. I dialed an old number and waited for it to pick up.</p> <p>"Hello?"</p> <p>"Hello it's the girl from the mall. What did she say?"</p> <p>"Do you know where she lives?"</p> <p>"No, I don't want to go there. What?" she says.</p> <p>"I'm in a motel room."</p> <p>"She lives there?"</p> <p>"I saw her driving back. My name is Lisa. I am in room 603."</p> <p>"Well I don't have a room. I'll meet you there. I want you in bed so I will hear about this before we go to sleep."</p> <p>"Do you give oral sex?"</p> <p>"Not unless it is really a man's job. When we are having sex, I love the taste of his penis in my mouth so I will be honest and say no to any man."</p> <p>"I'm not a man. I'm a woman."</p> <p>"If something like that happens, please stop right at this instant. I may decide I don't want to do anything that I don't think you want me to do."</p> <p>That was a strange reaction. Lisa was very conservative in her sex life. She had her share of boyfriends and she never went all the way with a boy. I was wondering if she just made up her mind that way.</p> <p>"If what you just said is true, what I want is to be with a man that loves me. I'm not ready for that just yet and I don't want to do that with a guy. If I meet a man that is nice and I know I can love him and be with him is the only way."</p> <p>I was surprised at her words. She wasn't sure if she was serious or not. "I'm going to the park tomorrow. My parents are gone for the weekend and I have the house to myself."</p> <p>"I know, I can't. I won't touch you in any way with me there."</p> <p>"I have to go. Have a good day Lisa."</p> <p>"Don't go Lisa." She says through a groggy.</p> <p>"I didn't say I won't Lisa." She says without a hint of a smile.</p> <p>"Okay, I'll stay."</p> <p>She says goodnight and I turn toward my room. What could she mean? I am not sure what this man could be like to me. The next man is as much as I have been with a woman that I know would not be interested in him. I am not sure what I would do for sex if I knew this man.</p> <p>The motel room is not much more than a small bed. The walls are thin and a thick cover was covering everything. There is a small table and coffee table around one end of the room. A few chairs are scattered in the room and they match the rest of the room. There is also a large bed with a blanket hanging off the bed while there is a bedside table where I know that there is nothing else to do. I am beginning to wonder if you can be a decent husband and do something really good in the bedroom.</p> <p>I lay on the bed and closed my eyes. I am sure that the sound of the television is playing some mindless television show. Lisa will get home tomorrow. What am I going to do all this time? I have never even kissed a man before and I am not sure what I would do about it. If I find out that she is not interested in me, I hope she doesn't see what I just got up to with this man. I am too angry to be thinking about that right now. For a moment, I wish that I would at least see him. I want to see if he had a cock. I wish that I could be as good and gentle as she was.</p> <p>I am not sure if I want to go to that motel. I can hear the news on the television playing on the television. I hear the voice on the television talking.</p> <p>"Well, that was a pleasant surprise. I hope you have a nice rest so I can get some sleep tomorrow. I might call to let you know thatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
