It seems like you're more than just a friendly acquaintance. As I think our conversation, you are certainly an interesting guest. What a wonderful evening."</p> <p>As I walked away she smiled, the thought of going home again and finding me alone with my lips sealed in a velvet kiss, her eyes glittering with glee. Oh, I'm so glad I didn't bring anything else to wear for our outing and my cock started to get stiff in my pants. I smiled, took a deep breath, and walked back into the kitchen.</p> <p>"Do you find me attractive?" I asked.</p> <p>"How do you mean? I mean, do you like going home with a naked woman?"</p> <p>"Yes." She took a drink. "Now," she said, "that's a question that would be difficult with a full erection, wouldn't you agree?"</p> <p>"Yes. I like the idea of going home naked but I think we need to go with a more sophisticated way of doing that."</p> <p>I'd seen my chance coming, so I was in favor. "I'll run down and get my shaving kit. Let's do it now and go to my room and get our clothes on."</p> <p>"You're so serious. You're not serious. Let's do it right. I won't get mad any more than you won't."</p> <p>I pulled on my coat and we both went into the elevator and headed for our room. "The first thing I want to see at your door is whether you can walk and look back. Is that something you're interested to do?"</p> <p>"I will admit that I would like to feel free and sexy to a degree."</p> <p>We hugged. She pulled back a little so that I could see her face, which was still beautiful, and, I thought, very beautiful. I pulled my cap back on and she took another drink. I handed her a drink and stood in the doorway, trying to put it back on the coaster.</p> <p>"You're right, this is a very sensitive evening." I said, laughing.</p> <p>"Are you?" She came up to me and gave me a kiss full on the lips. "Is that a compliment?" she asked.</p> <p>"A kind of jealousy of that." I told her. "You're my wife. I was thinking we could go on a trip together again, maybe even see the ocean."</p> <p>"The ocean." She said it like it was a fact. "When did you say you were a 'nude' sailor?" she asked.</p> <p>"Just before I got your husband to the airport."</p> <p>"Well," she continued, "you've been taking care of me for almost a year, haven't you? You've still got a body to look good in and I'm going to find out what parts I know you'll really like to play with." I took her hand and pulled her into the bedroom. I had a bottle of KY from the medicine cabinet and took out a tube from it. I took one out and opened it, coating my erection with lube. I poured a generous amount on her right buttock and then knelt down; placing my hands on her hips and spreading her cheeks. I knelt back up, and rubbed some more down onto her pink rosebud, making her squirm. When I was done with that I slid my hands up her thighs to her waist and pulled her toward me, taking my hard-on between her legs. She placed her hands on my shoulders and pushed back toward me, opening herself for me and spreading her knees wider to allow me access. I pushed forward and slid forward into her wetness, sliding easily into her as far as there could be. "Do you like what you see? I haven't really had a chance to see much of you yet."</p> <p>"Yes," she panted, "I do like it. I like you. You're a very sexy man. And you fill me completely. I feel like our life together has changed a lot."</p> <p>"Good," I said as I began to pull out. "You're getting wet."</p> <p>"Yes," she responded. "I want to please you. Please. Please just fuck me right here."</p> <p>I got up on my knees and turned her around, getting my cockhead between her spread legs. I held my cock at her entrance, lined it up with her pussy and slid it all the way in. She was so wet, so hot, so tight, I'd never been in this position before. I began to pump her with a steady pace, taking long, long strokes. Her hands reached round and around and she clutched at my back and shoulders as I drilled her as deeply as I knew she could take it, taking her back down onto my cock with each stroke.
