"You can't be serious."</p> <p>"I'm serious," I responded a bit harder as she moved forward onto her back, her tits hovering invitingly over the cold, wet, hard concrete of the pool. "Is that how you really want to be treated?"</p> <p>"I think I've made the right decision," she said simply and slowly and with a huge smile spread her legs apart. "Fuck me," she commanded.</p> <p>I leaned over her and took her from the front. She lay back and raised her legs and started to rock back against me as we were both eager with want of what was to come. As I was about to try to get inside of her I couldn't and then, as we both started to move with the rhythms of our body, she began to squeal and move with us. We were both trying to feel the inside of her soft vagina, and we were both feeling what we had wanted from each other for so long. I was trying to be slow while looking for the greatest feeling, the one that would allow me to make love to her slowly.</p> <p>But just as suddenly as it had begun, we were done. I began again, but then we were both crying. Not at the realization of having lost the love that we had made, but in frustration, pain, jealousy and most of all something else. We both took each breath in as a wave of release washed over us. We sat on the pool's bottom.</p> <p>"Was that what you wanted," I asked her.</p> <p>"Yes, it was," she told me. We both knew what answer that was, but neither of us wanted to tell the fact.</p> <p>We lay there for a while, and I don't think either of us really had any idea if you could do the same. We knew there was a level of intimacy there. We knew our feelings, especially hers, were deeply felt. We felt the love both our bodies felt for each and each other. It was something we could do together, even without knowing if it was just meant to a friend that was making love to someone else, or if the two of us were sharing our deepest most thoughts.</p> <p>But just as quickly as that moment had begun, it was no longer a memory. Our lives were no longer the same. It was as if nothing had changed. We had always loved our friends, and we had loved the love you had for them.</p> <p>Eventually I managed to get up and we went into the house as I wanted to tell her something. We had to keep secrets from you. If it came to that point in our relationship I wanted to be honest, honest with her. But once we were back in her home, the next thing I knew we were both kissing again. Our hands were busy, exploring each other's body.</p> <p>"I wish I could be there with you this morning," I confessed. "I have a confession I want to make."</p> <p>"What?" She asked. "I couldn't possibly take that seriously!"</p> <p>"Yeah," I said sheepishly, but with a smile and another hug. "I'd love to be with you all day."</p> <p>I started to get up, but she pulled me back down.</p> <p>"Let's get dressed."</p> <p>I pulled my swimsuit pants up and we ran back to the house naked. I had on my shirt, and she had on her own swimsuit. The next morning I called my friend in and made sure he was up and ready to help in the kitchen. I was waiting to tell him something, so I did it while he was talking to my friend on the phone. When he heard the first of what he thought was my 'yes', he broke the moment too and headed off to work.</p> <p>Our friends were not sure what to make of the idea of us hooking up with one another for the first time in several years. I had seen it in the movies, but I never thought we would actually go all the way. But we decided to go all the way just the same. The more time we spent together, the more we enjoyed each other. There were no secrets at home. We did everything together, with no secrets to lose. There were no secrets of our pasts. Things between us were nothing. My friend and I have never been the same since, even when we were first made love. I always feel safe and at ease, just like we have always done over the years. We are in no hurry. There is nothing that has ever changed.</p> <p>And now that I had theâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
