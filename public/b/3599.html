I can't wait to try out one of you."</p> <p>With that he kissed me so passionately he wanted so bad I could taste it; kissing me the way a guy would be kissing me was all about him. When I felt his tongue inside my mouth I knew this isn't what I had wanted from the beginning. I was about to cry out when he grabbed me and kissed me as if I hadn't been able to breathe for hours and then said "There's no reason to lie baby, we just needed to have a drink." We went into the bar and ordered a round of drinks.</p> <p>I looked him in the eye and smiled when he said "The alcohol is having its effect on you?" I nodded. "I've known for a while now that I wanted some more fun with you, but was afraid of the repercussions when I found out we were not being as open to each other as we should be, that's why I just got the promotion yesterday and got a promotion that's why I'm looking to get back into the business. I'm starting to think I'm about to do just that when I hear that he's looking for a replacement and for what reason? He looks like he just wants to jump his lover's bones!" He took his drink in one go and then laughed when he saw I was smiling at him and nodded. "Don't worry, I'm not leaving you out if you don't want to take another step." I nodded and he grabbed my cock which had recovered from the kiss and asked me "Will you take care of me please?" He grabbed me and led me out of the bar as if he didn't really want me and took my hand and led me into the hotel bar and was sitting with a beer when I asked him "So I've heard, how about you?" He smiled and shook his head. "I haven't been to this part of the city before and I've been looking for someone who didn't care for my wife, so I thought it would be fun. This way, we can get this job done as much as possible without having to spend money or spending a lot of time on food."</p> <p>I agreed and he ordered another round of drinks and was just beginning to laugh when I just stood there and then told him that was the greatest lie in the world and that even if it was true, I would not give up the chance to have the best sex in my life. "Ok", he replied, "this isn't every whore I've had. You sure can be a lot of fun. You're definitely an older woman." I grinned and kissed him again.</p> <p>We walked into the bar and he asked me to dance and I was a little taken back, but I quickly learned that this is where I was going to get my first taste of the new business and it would have to be fun. I didn't really know much about the dance culture but from the way he looked at me and laughed at me during the dance I figured, what am I supposed to do when he gets an email on him from someone else? I knew that I didn't need to be dancing very hard to get his attention so I just smiled and let it go by. When we got back to the room he had turned up the stereo and a romantic soft rock CD. He dropped his pants and we were totally naked and I was really horny.</p> <p>There is a woman I'm sure doesn't care that all other guys in my presence get turned on by a girl but I think she knows what it feels like to be totally naked with an attractive man. I put my tongue in his mouth and found it didn't take much to excite him. I slid down and took him into me and he moaned at the feel of my tongue on his. I felt his cock harden against my belly and it seemed as if I was making a difference in him. I slid it into myself and he seemed to be enjoying every second. I reached up and grabbed him in my hand so the head of his cock was touching my lips and I guided him in.</p> <p>We were in perfect rhythm and I felt my excitement rising just as I began to cum, knowing that I would probably never see his cock again made me even crazier as he held me tighter and increased his thrusting. I think I heard "Oh fuck!" But I was lost in the intensity of the moment knowing that neither of us would be able to take much more, then he pulled out and rolled us over so I was on my back then he slid into me again and I felt his hard body underneath me and it made me feel so fucking good. We kissed deeply, his hands were now caressing my body, his fingers going all over me; he slipped a finger in my ass and started to fuck me with his hand.</p> <p>His thrusts wereâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
