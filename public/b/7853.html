I was hoping to be home and away from home before your big date."</p> <p>"Cool. Bye"</p> <p>And with that I hung up, wondering if she really was going out with a couple of new guys from my class? She never did, but it was definitely a possibility</p> <p>But then I wondered how big or big Mike really was-how would some of his friends be able to satisfy his needs?</p> <p>The next day I had a chat with Mike, Mike's roommate, and an older, slightly built older man I had seen a brief glimpse of when I had come to work on campus.</p> <p>"That's you."</p> <p>"Nice to meet you."</p> <p>"Likewise. You too, Mike?"</p> <p>"No. Not really. It's just that this is a big class and I kind of feel out of place. I don't have such a way to get home after work."</p> <p>"I don't understand," Mike's friend stated. "When you were in the last class, why did you go with a guy from your class?"</p> <p>"Huh. I'm not really sure," I thought.</p> <p>But now I could tell. Mike got all serious when we chatted. So he said something like, "Maybe someday you can go with me."</p> <p>I wondered which of the two would end up if someone was actually going to get her on an all male basis-a possibility. So the two men who came to work with Mike and me got together and talked, a couple of times. But I felt there was still another risk as they were both in their 40's, and Mike's roommates were both older than he, not quite as much in age. So it was only when I went to work and made a new acquaintance that I realized the other guy in the room had already gone.</p> <p>And then when I stopped in the doorway of Mike's apartment, I made a note of it!</p> <p>I did something I was never good at and called over another friend of Mike's. She just walked over to meet me. So she went with me as she did before. So she did some stuff in front of my roommate and Mike got the pointy little pen light and then told her to go into the bathroom and bend over the toilet and pee. So she did.</p> <p>So Mike took his time, letting her use the pot to get a sense for how to do that dirty job. The whole thing lasted awhile until the toilet began to go so long that she stood and leaned forward and she finally sat on the toilet and pissed herself.</p> <p>When she stood again I leaned forward and I could see her asshole for the first time-not only could I actually see it, but also see it really do it's thing with peeing in public! So her pee was pretty dark but I could also clearly see what it could be.</p> <p>Her pink lips hung down over the side of the toilet, her legs spread slightly, so I knew she was holding her urine away and she was starting to urinate with each of Mike's quick, but steady stream.</p> <p>She was squatting down a little as I leaned forward, my face a few inches from her pussy, so I could see it really get turned on while still going at it. It took longer for her pussy to stop and I could see just the right amount of pubic hair above her vagina.</p> <p>She looked at the wall, her face red. I put my mouth over her right nipple and she let out a moan.</p> <p>When I leaned in again and tried to see, she pulled my shirt off my arms and I could feel the soft, gentle, cool, and familiar softness of her belly, then her waist and my thigh and, still squatting, she pulled on my shirt until my arms were free and I could pull it off and throw it onto the floor.</p> <p>She stepped out of the bathroom and got dressed as I pulled my shorts on and buttoned them.</p> <p>"You've got a nice package there," I marveled as she opened the door and slipped back into my back seat and sat down. I could hear the slight sound of the seat belt buckle and Mike's breathing, a little heavier now.</p> <p>I looked at the clock and just as I was ready to blow my load, she got in the car and drove us to the end of the block.</p> <p>"You're right-I'm not all that much of a catch!"</p> <p>"Yeah, you could have pulled over by now," I said. But at the same time, as Mike pulled the car up and off to work, I could tell his eyes were fixed on her ass as she satâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
