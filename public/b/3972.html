You should finish," I teased back.</p> <p>She stood and reached her hand down to the side. It was soaked. "Oh fuck."</p> <p>"That was hot," Jason muttered, his eyes glancing her ass, which was covered by the g-string.</p> <p>"Mmm we can't have that...can we?" she asked, pulling her dress higher. It rode up so far it nearly came to the waist, exposing her shaved cunt. She pulled the elastic of her g-string back and off, tossed it onto Jason's lap. She turned back around and bent over, placing her hands on the counter for support. "You better get it," she giggled, "or it'll get in my crack."</p> <p>"Is this yours?" Jason asked, his hands running all the way up her dress, stopping a second when they met her pussy.</p> <p>"I hope so." She lifted her bottom, placing her pussy right at Jason's head.</p> <p>"God, are you sure a dirty girl isn't allowed to wear pants at the beach?" he said, licking her slit.</p> <p>"Not really."</p> <p>"So go get it." He hopped up and grabbed her hips for support, guiding her back onto the counter. She wiggled her hips in a teasing manner as she grabbed the counter and put it back.</p> <p>It took a minute for Jason to pull off his pants and join her. He was hard and ready for her, but for a different reason this time. She could feel his head inside her. It brushed the outer lips of her pussy where it came in contact with the thin fabric of the fabric, and he pulled it to the side. She took a deep breath as he pushed himself in her. He slid into her slowly but smoothly.</p> <p>"God yes, Jason. I told you I love the feel of you in me. It's perfect," she breathed.</p> <p>She turned and leaned over the counter, resting her hands on her back. Jason looked into her eyes as he took turns sliding himself in and out of her. She let her head drop onto the counter and closed her eyes, enjoying each slow and strong thrust. "Mmm, yes," she moaned, her body completely relaxed from the orgasm.</p> <p>Jason began to speed up and began a steady rhythm, feeling the blood flow back into his dick. She moaned as they sped up, her body completely alive from the sensations. His breath was catching in his throat as he began to work in sync with her moans. She slid her hands under his ass and began to push up, to meet him as he pushed himself further in. His dick began to hit the g-spot, making him feel it. He started to groan, and she heard him in short labored breaths.</p> <p>"Mmm, yes...I'm going to cum!" he gritted his teeth and fucked her harder, sending a wave of pleasure through her body. Just a split second before he exploded in her pussy, she wrapped her arms around his neck, and he kissed her neck as his dick left her pussy. He pulled away, grabbed her waist and sat her down on the counter again.</p> <p>"Turn around," he said, standing up and pulling her back to her feet. He took in the sight of the wet, sodden patch where he was buried inside her and the view of her body, which he had previously wanted, had never been in front of him before.</p> <p>"Fuck," she moaned.</p> <p>"Turn around for me and let me eat you."</p> <p>She spun around and placed a hand on either hip. He quickly pulled off his boxers and kneeled down in front of her. She spread her legs wide and let him lower, but he didn't enter her.</p> <p>"Honey, no, wait," she said, reaching out for some tissue.</p> <p>"Come with me. We don't have to do this later. That is still your choice, baby," he said, taking a long slurp of his own cum that he scooped from her opening.</p> <p>She turned and kissed him. "Fuck, you taste better than you look."</p> <p>"Did you cum? I can't take the chance," she teased, looking him directly in the eye.</p> <p>"No, I just came," he said, smiling at her.</p> <p>"Oh my god," she said, still in shock at how turned-on he was making her feel by being with him while his cum splattered in her open-mouthed kiss.</p> <p>"Let's see." He reached under the counter, and pulled open the front door as he watched her. She looked back expectantly at him. He closed the door behind him, and motioned her toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
