I knew it wasn't my name but she didn't seem to care who called her and she kissed me again.</p> <p>"Hey, there's no one in this building. I'm sure we can find someone to dance with for a while." I couldn't find any one at this point but she asked me the bartender once again.</p> <p>"I'm not dancing this time." I couldn't believe what I was saying. Her smile didn't seem like a joke any longer.</p> <p>"Of course you're not. It's my job to make sure that you're safe. That's just what you're here for" she giggled and kissed me again, her tongue probing gently inside my mouth, exploring my mouth. I wrapped my arms around her and took a deep breath as if I had just run a marathon. I had her in my arms almost instantly and I wanted to make love to her all over again. I felt dizzy and faint as well as hot and bothered, the excitement was almost too much.</p> <p>As we danced, as someone who is often called an expert, even she could dance with me, but she didn't. I told her I thought she was a good dancer and she giggled that too because her voice had an incredible effect on me. I could feel her firm breasts pressed against me and we swayed to the music, making love as we kissed. I put my arm gently around her, caressing her as we stood in front of the dance floor. She looked at me with a smile and I smiled back, and she looked at me with a smile as well. We danced together like that for a while and then moved off the dance floor.</p> <p>"What did you think of the place?" she asked.</p> <p>"It's like some country club," I said.</p> <p>"Do you dance a lot?" she asked.</p> <p>"Yeah, it's my work. I hope that doesn't bother you?" I asked, trying to sound interested.</p> <p>"No, it's a nice place to be," she said. "And if you're a good dancer, maybe I'll let you try my room so you can change your clothes."</p> <p>I said okay. I'd never tried her room, I only had her room when I worked there. It was only the one time we got her things in the morning, so technically, it wasn't such a big deal anymore.</p> <p>As we walked to my room, I couldn't contain my excitement. I'd never had a chance to make anything other than one of the most amazing sex I'd ever had. I had to get her undressed right in the middle of our dancing, and I'd never come up with anything else I wanted to do, and I was really attracted to her. Maybe she would understand. No, after tonight, maybe she wouldn't. Even if I didn't find out how wild I'd been, just maybe, maybe she would enjoy it.</p> <p>When we got to her room, we took off our clothes and jumped on the bed on our knees. She strummed as much of the strings as she could and I got my face and hands on her naked body. After she had a couple of orgasms, she asked me to make love to her. I did just that, licking all the strings again and again.</p> <p>"It's been a long time," I said, kneeling in front of her and looking down into her eyes. She reached out and began caressing my face and hair again, the way she had touched me.</p> <p>"You're just asking me if I thought that maybe tomorrow I could just make love to you," I told her, holding her face in my hands as I kissed her.</p> <p>"I want to make you happy," she said. "I really do." She kissed me again, holding me close and running her warm fingers down over my chest. I loved what she was doing and couldn't take it anymore if I didn't stop it. I broke the kiss and pulled her to me and kissed her. She was a great kisser, and when I kissed her neck and throat I thought I might start to feel something inside her. When I kissed her lips I could feel the first quivering of her body. And when I kissed her forehead and then her eyes, I felt the same trembling of the first tremble.</p> <p>"You taste good," I told her, and she looked in my eyes and smiled.</p> <p>"Do you think something happened?" I hoped she knew what I meant.</p> <p>"Definitely, I don't think you can go back to the way you used to," she told me. "I want to make love with you." That was the last thing she said to me, even though she didn't say it. She kissed meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
