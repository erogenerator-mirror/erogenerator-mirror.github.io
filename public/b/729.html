As she approached she had an idea of what she thought of when the next patient would be. She had never been with a guy after her second miscarriage. Her mind was in turmoil and she did not need anyone's opinion.</p> <p>After the day's tests got better she told the doctor she was fine. But, it was another day of agony and her heart ached terribly. Her heart was already racing as the days passed like a dream. But, what can I do? If I were not married I couldn't do anything. She was so sick of waiting, her husband thought she was the most beautiful woman in the world. He wanted her all his life. And, he wasn't even sure what he wanted to do about it.</p> <p>Now, she had to do that. She began taking the pills they gave her and she could not stop the flood of emotion that ran in waves through her. In the months following that same day on the fifth, she was getting weaker and in a very dark moment of depression she even contemplated killing herself herself but, she was never able to make the decision.</p> <p>"How am I going to be able to live with that?" she said to herself. It was her heart that worried. It was her soul that felt safe and loved. She knew that now. Even if she wanted to kill herself, she couldn't do it. She was so wrong for not getting any stronger to go to see her boss. She started praying the best because she realized she prayed so many times.</p> <p>She was going to take the pills and then tell God she was too tired to come again. She would do so. It would be over by the time she was done with the pills, she thought. And, God help her, she could not keep up with them.</p> <p>She was just going to take the pills and not tell her boss anything about it. It was the day before her period came and it had been almost a month of time since her last period. She was going to kill the woman beside whom she was going to die before it went to the nurse again.</p> <p>A knock on the door interrupted her thoughts and she opened it to find the woman she remembered. "How did you know I had another period today?" she asked in the worst way.</p> <p>"We had already spoken to the nurse today. I didn't want to see you at least another twelve days since you're supposed to be working the morning shift." the woman replied.</p> <p>"I didn't know you worked at the hospital?" she asked a little sadly.</p> <p>"No, my wife is sick and my boss is sick so..." she looked at him. "I'll do anything for you. I won't go without if you don't want me." she said softly. "I was not going to leave you for another two months. That's all I wanted, to be alone. But, you had to believe me after everything that's been going on?"</p> <p>"I suppose you were supposed to stay home after school and work?" the nurse said looking at him intently.</p> <p>"Yes. I was hoping you would have enough money to cover me." he said almost sadly.</p> <p>"Are you sure I don't have to worry about your husband or your mother finding out?" she asked. Her voice had a desperation like a kitten's eyes.</p> <p>His answer was a long, deep sigh. "Well," he said, "I guess we'll just have to live with the stress."</p> <p>After the day they spent apart the following week, a sense of relief began to grow into a new wave of sadness. Maybe she would give him his happiness when he finally realized he no longer felt as alone as she had done. Maybe he would even feel free to be with his wife.</p> <p>Chapter Five</p> <p>One day in the spring she was ready to leave that dreadful day as early as she could. In a way it was the last day she would be in the office. But, she was not going to stop to pick up the empty envelope for her boss. She wouldn't get a chance. She just wanted to stay home. She started planning how to get out of there.</p> <p>The week passed slowly and in the end the first day she decided she didn't have enough leave. The last time she really needed was Monday when her boss came by her office to ask her something. But, her boss was waiting for her at home. She told him it was not really her favorite time of the week and was just her favorite time of the whole thing.</p> <p>"Oh, come on," he said with a laugh, "I'm not leaving here like you were!"</p> <p>At first she felt sorry for him. He didn't care what she had to say but, she didnâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
