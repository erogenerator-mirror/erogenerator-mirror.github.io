He asked me to repeat my question as he answered "I don't do that anymore" the next moment.</p> <p>"I've been taking all that from a tax return for over a year. I don't want to risk it, and even more, I also don't have any money for you to help the girls at the gym and to get back into the real world".</p> <p>"That was an interesting question, but where does I get my money?" I asked.</p> <p>"Well, let's just say that I was the one who suggested you work out, and I think that you've had sex with many of the same female employees," he answered.</p> <p>"Well, the last one did a number on me for starters," I told him. "But I wouldn't even do a hundred."</p> <p>"You were lucky." He said and with that he smiled to let me know that he had picked the perfect woman for the job at that time. We had a nice conversation in which he gave me compliments about who he was and where he wanted to go to work. All throughout it, I kept thinking that I was actually going to be a part of the gym. Not for him, but for me. That had certainly crossed my mind.</p> <p>Our conversation continued as we finished eating dinner. When I was done eating my dessert, I took my plate to the sink and washed the remnants down. I then wiped myself down with a towel before putting the dishes into the washer. I was thinking that he and I might spend the rest of the evening getting to know each other better and for a while.</p> <p>We finished our meal and we walked out of the restaurant. As we walked to my car, I turned to face him. I smiled at him while I said "You look great", and I leaned over and kissed him.</p> <p>"Where on earth were you going" He asked.</p> <p>"To get started" I smiled at him "so now I'm going to show you that I've been taking care of you."</p> <p>"You're going to be seeing lots more of me, " he said.</p> <p>"I think you just had the best teacher that I've ever had." I said in reply.</p> <p>As we arrived at the gym, I showed him to his room and we went inside to have about another 45 minutes of hot steamy torrid sex. We fucked on and on but I didn't want to end the session. I wanted to make the most of the time I got.</p> <p>At 1:30 that evening, I got up and got dressed to go and have the evening planned with my boss. We left the gym around 3:30 and I had to walk to Jim's office. When I arrived, he greeted me with a huge smile on his face and sat in his office chair. I walked up to him and asked "How was my dinner?" Jim opened his arms and I put on a hug and kissed him on the cheek saying "My pleasure." I then walked back into his office and shut the door.</p> <p>I looked at him puzzled and asked "So, could I please get into your pants before you leave." Jim looked up at me with a smile. I was still wondering just how he was feeling about me being his teacher and I certainly wasn't about to change his mind and I was hoping to have the time of my life. But in the meantime, he was sitting in his office. The clock read 2:45 and it was not unusual for Jim staff to rush into office and shut the door to check their messages.</p> <p>As I turned to face him, I said "I've had a real fun day today".</p> <p>"You did huh", he replied. "Well there can be no other way to say it."</p> <p>I smiled at him and said "I was afraid that you'd take that as a rejection."</p> <p>"The offer didn't come on the best day but I was happy to let you get your workout." He said as he took the gym bag from his desk.</p> <p>"Are you sure you want to do this again?" I replied.</p> <p>"Absolutely," he replied in a soft voice. "I'm sure that you won't mind if I bring another woman with me if you meet one."</p> <p>"Nope" I replied. "But I'm sure that you'll find someone else to take care of me."</p> <p>"I'll do my best" he replied and he was right. I was so hot that it took only a few minutes to make me forget about how much I had enjoyed the day. And when I got back to our room I found him in Jim'sâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
