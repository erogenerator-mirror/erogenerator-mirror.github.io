He just kept going, looking at the pictures she had picked out for his collection and smiling knowingly as he made a few comments, finally moving her hand to the back of his head and pulling him forwards so that her mouth was level with his. They kissed passionately, the intensity of the moment almost too much, as well as the sexual tension.</p> <p>"That was amazing." she muttered, her voice barely audible</p> <p>"I'm glad," he grinned, pressing her fingers to her lips as he leaned forward to suck her tongue. "So when do I get to come back?" he asked, kissing her gently on her mouth, letting his tongue slide inside her and running it along her lips.</p> <p>"I'm counting on it." she replied, turning away before he could respond, turning around to face him. "Can I?"</p> <p>"Of course."</p> <p>He stood up and moved quickly, placing in a folder on his desk and quickly pulling out a photo from his pocket, his hand reaching out to push it against the wall. It was, surprisingly, from the moment he had first met her, that the photos were still of him. He held it in his hand, looking at the image, thinking the two of them had spent so much time and energy in their cubicles he knew that they had both got a good look at each other. It was then that he realised that he had taken a couple of his own pictures, taking out a couple of the ones of his face when he saw a face with his tongue, and from that it seemed that only she had had any second thoughts about having him for his birthday. Not that it could be hard, that she knew he was, and that he seemed to really like having her for his birthday every year, because they were, he told himself, an age apart...</p> <p>"No, I don't think so."</p> <p>"Why not?"</p> <p>"Well... when you let me come back I don't think you'd want me seeing your photos." he replied, looking around the other cubicle. "I know this looks like there's been a fair bit of talk already, but you're not allowed to look at pictures, are you?" he said when he could talk properly, knowing that she had probably thought they had been the talk of the day. Even if she hadn't looked he was pretty sure he would have heard her voice. He grinned mischievously at her.</p> <p>"It's perfectly legal here." he said, moving towards her. Her face betrayed no sign of having any idea what he wanted her to do anymore.</p> <p>"Really?" he was shocked to see her actually react. Her mouth dropped open in shock, her expression shifting so that he had to look up to make sure she was actually speaking. "Well, what do you want me to do?"</p> <p>"Don't do anything. You can look at us." He ordered in a strong, authoritarian voice, his whole body shaking in excitement as he pulled off his clothes and stood naked in the middle of the cubicle, looking at her for her reaction, even as he mentally compared the situation to her photo albums.</p> <p>"Yes sir, anything."</p> <p>"Good, then strip off your clothes like everyone else in here is doing," he told her, moving towards him slowly and watching her expression intently. She hesitated, not sure if she should back down or comply with the order, it would also be bad to get caught doing anything this public. Still, something seemed to make her hesitate. He wanted her to strip as quickly as possible, but he thought he had better take it a step further, so he moved his body forward until they were standing face to face, his cock still fully erect from her reactions, the feeling of her hot breath between them as her hands moved, finally, one by one, to the buttons of his shirt. Her hands reached out to grab them as she felt the material, and to his shock, her fingers didn't even try to pull it forward, just slip under the collar of his shirt. She pulled his shirt off in a second, quickly, and he was naked.</p> <p>"That better?" he asked her, standing over her in the cubicle and smiling. It was obviously his intention, and he was about to walk out of the cubicle and into one of the cubicles, but she had other ideas. Pulling away once his shirt was off, she quickly stood up.</p> <p>"Don't move." she said, not looking him in the eyes. She knew the position. He was still looking anywhere but into her eyes now, waiting to see what she would do next. This made her hesitate again, but the excitement was undeniable. It wasn't as though she was just goingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
