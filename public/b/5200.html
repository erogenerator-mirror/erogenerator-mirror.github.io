She exclaimed, giving me one of her deep, sensuous smiles</p> <p>"Oh! Oh! You're making me blush!" I blushed furiously as the words began to pass over my face. "Here comes the last part."</p> <p>I closed my eyes and turned to the girls. They stood in a wide circle with her hands behind her back to keep her hair out of my line of sight and forgoing any more than shoulder-to-shoulder. All in my line... a line... that would be so perfect between our legs!</p> <p>"Well, well, Mr. Johnson!" She cooed happily in my ear, "I see that you've made the correct choice after all!"</p> <p>"Well, well, I guess I should be sure in order to keep up with the young ladies."I replied sarcastically.</p> <p>"And why, sir?"The brunette asked in an amused tone "Was I right?"</p> <p>"Well, I just hope he behaves himself here, doesn't it."</p> <p>The brunette nodded. "And do you?" she asked.</p> <p>"Well, I don't know. Should I wait, or wait for him to have a chance to get out of here?"</p> <p>"Of course, Sir!" The brunette smiled and pointed to me, "I'd really like you to give yourself a chance so we can get going again."</p> <p>"And if I did have one chance to get back home, I'd have to be out of here, so if I came back the same time he did it again, I'd have to give myself a good chance as well!"</p> <p>Their expressions conveyed their total approval of my plan.</p> <p>"Now!" The brunette growled in my ear "If you want to make it to lunch today, we'd like to bring him along too!"</p> <p>"But of course." I replied.</p> <p>"That's a deal." The brunette smiled and leaned her lips into my ear. "But before we go, should I lock up and go home?"</p> <p>"No, that's not necessary," I replied, "But we won't keep this quiet anymore. This is the way we're going to be the last day of this visit - or at least the two of us. We're going to make this very special!"</p> <p>"Hmmm... yes, we will!" She cooed in my other ear. "And it's going to be very, very special from the looks on your faces from watching us! They'll all be as excited as we are!"</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>Mr. Johnson didn't answer his phone when I arrived in the lobby of my condo building at one o'clock the next morning. When I walked in he was standing on the curb in front of me, the wind blowing past his hairless, stubbly eyebrows, staring at a phone lying on the curb about a foot away from the building.</p> <p>"Hey there, stranger!" He grinned at me, "You missed me last night at your apartment, didn't you?"</p> <p>I nodded my assent and walked past him on my way to the elevator bank. On the way I stopped at the directory and found the familiar digits that made my life complete. On the first few digits I was the only one in the directory. I was also the last person to have a visitor on my watch list that day.</p> <p>"Well, it's a pity that it's empty." The familiar voice began its soft cadence once more. "I'll have you there at any rate."</p> <p>"Thanks." I said quietly, but quickly. "What's your last name?" I felt that familiar sensation returning in parts of my body.</p> <p>"Frank." He replied, and added, "It was your name you asked me to give the day before last."</p> <p>"That doesn't mean that the name is going to continue to be Frank?" I smiled sweetly. "I guess it makes sense."</p> <p>And he did. After hearing the last words that came out of his mouth in one sentence, just as I was on the verge of turning to leave that morning, he quickly finished his sentence and stepped back to the elevator. Just as soon as he left the elevator he turned his attention to me and stepped with a smile to me. It occurred to me that I had known all along that day that he and I were going to be a couple in a matter of weeks and that would be the most amazing days of my life... and that he did indeed love to love me. It was also possible that I would find out if anyone else had the same thoughts as him and I had.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>When I was ready to leave that morning at oneâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
