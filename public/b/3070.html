I ask looking at his eyes. "What are you afraid of?"</p> <p>"Your cock?" he mutters with a huge grin. "I'm afraid what you're used to is nothing, so I'm going to make use of that." He laughs as I laugh myself.</p> <p>I pull him into me with my left leg and lock my heels behind his shoulders. He puts his right arm around me and squeezes my right breast.</p> <p>We stand like that for a moment, me with my arms wrapped around Alex as he feels the weight of me, his hands and chest on me. I want to get him off, I want to keep him hard for us to start again, but he's teasing me. He takes a step back and reaches up and takes my face in his eyes. I feel his hips rubbing against my ass with each step. He kisses me on the neck, and then moves from my lips down to my ears. He continues to massage my breasts as he slowly lowers me to the floor. I'm in awe of the way he does it, the little tricks he knows I love just to see. "Lie down," he murmurs to me, as his hands move and move over my body, tracing up to my face first. He makes the rest of me arch and twist, and gently rubs against me. My skin is already tingling with every brush of his fingers.</p> <p>His hands are warm now, wet and slippery with my own sweat; I can imagine myself lying under him as he moves me into his body. I lift my body and feel his hard cock move up my slit. With the slick wetness of it I feel him enter me, filling me. I moan as his hips come down. I arch my body up to meet his, feeling him move in me and feeling every movement. He moves us together, in slow circles, just the motion of him pressing in and out, in and out. "God you feel so good," I whisper in his ear.</p> <p>"You feel so good, too, baby," he answers and nuzzles a lock of my hair back, holding me for a moment. Just the feel of him in me, of the little tickle of his hair makes me moan a little louder every time he does that.</p> <p>"Oh god, Alex, I love you so damn much!" I groan, pulling back. I pull his face up to mine and kiss his mouth. We move slowly as the intensity builds more and more, and kiss is never as long as it always is. We both grind against each other, the passion rising in the kiss, our bodies hot and ready. I'm still grinding my hips on him, feeling him slide in. "Oh, God! I'm going to come!" I whisper and then kiss his mouth again. Both of us moaning.</p> <p>I kiss him back the way I've always kissed him. He pulls away a little and takes my face in his hands, kissing me hard, breathing hot breath against my lips. He's almost biting my face, but I kiss him and let myself be taken by him, my body giving in as my breath returns to me. "I love you, Alex," I whisper.</p> <p>"You love me," he breathes against my lips as he does that. "We belong together like this."</p> <p>I can't help kissing him back. "Yes," I whisper. "We belong to each other." I'm kissing him back. His tongue is hot against mine as we continue to kiss. We're kissing, not just for ourselves, but because our need for each other is so strong that it makes our desire to each other's bodies to us even stronger. Alex slides his tongue away from my lips and pushes me back onto the bed. My body is his to do with as he wants, and he kisses his way down into my lap and over my sex to where our combined juices are leaking out onto the bed. It's all I can do not to cry out as he takes a finger and licks it off and then slides that up my slit over my clit and over my skin to my body, my lips, and my nipples.</p> <p>I lay there, breathing hard, my body tensed. My arms are out on a bunch of the sheets, but I won't give Alex any more. I know he's still looking at me, and I know that's what he likes to do. He loves to kiss my nipples. I'd seen him doing that in a movie once, and I didn't let him. I'm sure there are other things to do. I can't deny my body. I need him to touch me. To taste me. To feel me. Anything. Anything more than that.</p> <p>I lie there, trembling and unable to think, just looking down into his eyes. I'm sure I look like that, so much soâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
