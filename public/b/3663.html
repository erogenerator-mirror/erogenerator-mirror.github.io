I'm just not sure what I'm doing, but I am, it's just not the same as with you." He didn't think as he spoke that it was an over-active mind, even though this was a very good thing. And now he was going to play with it, or just do whatever he felt he needed to see if something would come through, and be a part of it. He took a deep breath before continuing, "but, I should say right now you're really gorgeous."</p> <p>Hannah's eyes widened as she realised what he meant by that, but she knew what she was thinking, not only of the man lying beneath her in her dream, but that she was actually getting off on this. "You are amazing," she said in a low breath, "oh, God, I haven't felt this hard in a long time, you're just incredible." She had hoped that he would say that, but instead he looked down at her, at her breasts in particular and looked so serious again. "So fucking beautiful," he repeated, reaching up and sliding his head down to her waist, "I'm going to have to go and take a shower," he said, "I have a big day tomorrow. You have the most amazing tits in the world and I want to fuck them."</p> <p>"So soon anyway," she replied, "are going to take a bath," Hannah felt a little nervous, she did not quite realise that what she meant was that now she would feel really naked in front of a strange man before she actually became comfortable, but she couldn't really expect it to happen with him. It still felt wrong though. "I haven't showered in ages and I'm not used to it, I need a shower now," she said, "what do you think? How would you like to go for a shower?"</p> <p>"Well... I think I'd love a bath," he answered, "I can't think of anything better I want to do than to run in to the loo, that's always handy when I get a really bad buzz."</p> <p>"A really bad buzz? You don't need to worry about that, I'm already using it. How about we go into the other bathroom together?"</p> <p>"Well..." he began, Hannah stopped him, "you could undress me, if you like."</p> <p>"I really want to undress you, you're gorgeous, you are just amazing, I'd love to strip you down to a larder, you'll do just fine," she said as she took off her blouse revealing her plain white bra, "would you mind if I took my skirt off?" Hannah quickly took off her skirt, leaving her in just her black stockings and low heels, "I want to do it for you, it might save the energy for later, would you mind undressing me if that's okay?"</p> <p>'Why?" he asked, "What about if I undress you, just like after the beach, are you sure you want to do that?"</p> <p>Hannah wasn't sure she should answer that, but she took it at face value, a slight blush spreading over her face, "I really would like that, I'd really like to, but I'm really nervous at the moment."</p> <p>"Well, in that case," he said, "let me undress you properly first, and you can join me in the shower with me."</p> <p>"Oh, that's... that's very kind of you," Hannah replied, "I really mean it, that's not an unreasonable request but I don't think I would even be able to do that."</p> <p>Hannah turned on the water in the huge bathroom, letting it run a little as it ran over her body, a small smile forming on her lips. There was something so sensual about going to the showers with someone, it wasn't like the 'experimentals' they had been doing years ago in the past, so much more than what she had done before. This was something completely new, something that she had never really experienced before and certainly never with a man before, it was just what she had to get ready to do for her fantasy man. She climbed into the shower and closed the door behind her, before leaning back against it. Although it was a little bigger than the one that she had in the dream, she couldn't stop herself from leaning against the side of the shower wall, her shoulders resting on the tiles in front of her. She opened her legs and let her hand caress her crotch, feeling the wetness that glistered between her legs each time her hand slipped between her legs. She parted her lips briefly with her fingers to feel her inner lips, which were very damp with desireâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
