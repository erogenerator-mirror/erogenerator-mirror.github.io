I didn't think we had time to move a lot, but I wanted to. As I was trying to catch my breath she started to rub my thighs again, this time up to my crotch. Not very gentle but not unpleasant either.</p> <p>"Can I go down on you?" she asked.</p> <p>We both knew no backing out.</p> <p>"I don't think we have much time..."</p> <p>"Come over here and give me that pussy I've been wanting to eat all day."</p> <p>As I knelt in front her, I could feel a little moisture starting to run down her leg. I kissed her thighs, and licked my way ever so slowly up her thigh. Again, no resistance.</p> <p>"Kiss my cunt lips," she said, "do it some more..." I kissed them, and licked slowly down her slit again. And again, no resistance.</p> <p>I slipped a finger inside and stroked it slowly. I could feel it getting moist, and getting fuller.</p> <p>"Suck my clit... it's so hard..." I knew she'd like that idea as much as I did, and I started to work it in and out. She was moaning louder now. My tongue worked her clit the way her husband's does. She started to wail, and then to cry out.</p> <p>"Oh yes! Oh yes... oh yes... oh yes! I'm coming! I'm coming! Ohhh! Yes, baby, keep going..."</p> <p>I could taste the saltiness, she was salty and wet, and I couldn't believe it.</p> <p>She pulled my head closer to her now.</p> <p>"No, I want your cock inside me. Now..."</p> <p>I nodded, she got on top of me. Our arms went around each other, we could both feel us touching. I didn't care that my wife's tongue was doing things my cock was doing to her, I had no intention of using that.</p> <p>We kissed some more, she let herself down on me and we fucked very gently and slowly with long deliberate strokes that almost had us both coming on the spot.</p> <p>"Oh my, your cock feels so damn good going in me! I want that to go forever!"</p> <p>She kissed me, and then started to move slowly up and down. It felt great! I was about to come, very soon. She moved down and just started to kiss the lips of my now-dripping cock.</p> <p>"I know you still like mine, but that's just the beginning. Come on, I want it all! I'm so ready!"</p> <p>We got off again and went down on the kitchen floor. I was lying on the floor, just enjoying the feel of her body on top of mine. We looked at each other and started again. I'm not sure if we could have held it together all day, but it felt so good to have them so close.</p> <p>"Oh! I want you to fuck me. I want your beautiful cock in me now! I want you to fuck me like I want you to fuck her! Come on, fuck me! You can do that! Take me. Take that beautiful cock! Give it to me! Fill me with your wonderful cum. Oh yes!"</p> <p>I know I was coming... it was a big one. Harder, just like I did with hers. She was so turned on she had to move fast.</p> <p>"Oh! I'm coming! I'm coming! Ohhh! Oh God that was so nice!"</p> <p>We just lay there on the kitchen floor. Sighs, groans, and noises coming from us, just the sound of my wife's passion. It was so romantic even the sex sounds.</p> <p>We just lay there, holding each other, smiling, kissing, wondering what to do next. Then she felt cold air from the kitchen door, and she lifted her arms to see if there was a draft from a vent outside. It didn't seem to be an unusual thing.</p> <p>I was trying to decide what to do. But I think she wasn't really going to do anything or say anything, because she just lay there. We were both breathing heavily, and then she said "Oh my!"</p> <p>Then she kissed me passionately, as we both got up, and then went back to the kitchen to get me a drink, and something to drink. We sat on the patio, and just talked for some time. I don't really remember much of that, but I must have been drunk. All I remember is that she had stripped my wife naked, and she had said, "Oh, I love you, Tom. I'll never leave you. You don't know it but you make me feel very special nowâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
