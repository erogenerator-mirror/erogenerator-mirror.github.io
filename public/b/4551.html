He got up and looked at it and then sat at his desk. He picked up the phone and picked it up again. This time, the voice was just his own. "Hello?" he said after an uncomfortable silence of several long seconds, "hello?" she answered.</p> <p>"Yes, Mr. Martin. I need help." he said in his thick, southern drawl. He had on the suit she had asked for earlier, along with his shoes. The name of his boss, Charles Martin, had come to mind.</p> <p>"It's me, Ma'am. Is this Mr. Martin?" He asked. He thought she was cute, for a guy with his hair pulled back and glasses up, but he got the feeling she had to be the real thing.</p> <p>"No, Ma'am. This is his friend, Charles Martin." She said in his ear.</p> <p>"Ah, is that so. How can I help?" Mr. Martin asked again. He had had trouble getting anything out of her last visit, or so he thought. He hoped as a customer not to feel cheap asking to use her services. He wondered if he had ever been called a customer by a customer before, or if she was just being nice, so all that mattered. He remembered he hadn't paid more than $400 or $800, when she came in and showed him the way.</p> <p>He looked up at her, his eyes a dead stare as he thought of the things they had to talk about. He knew he had to come to her sooner rather than later. He couldn't get any more than to call and tell her what she needed to know. It was a hard decision. If he came over to her and did it, the only thing that would keep him from her would be his mouth, which would keep him from her. She probably wouldn't like it, but he knew it wasn't because he couldn't keep her, was it? The whole scenario was a disaster. He had to convince her, but he had to be convincing, like he had to himself...</p> <p>"Yes, it's me." He told her. "Just follow me, Ma'am," he insisted, as he headed for the stairs.</p> <p>There were three offices along with an office area that went from right end to left end of the property, which was separated from the others by a three posted board. He'd taken the third floor, so he was alone. The first floor was his. His first meeting, if this was the sort of assignment he got. He wanted to talk to her about the phone call.</p> <p>The next meeting was a couple of different ways. He had to convince her to come to him after she saw him in their offices, at the same time that he was trying to persuade and talk her into coming to him. He was trying to be nice and easy, because he was a businessman after all. He had no real reason to come here, but he wanted to talk to her.</p> <p>He would have to make her his secretary, but he didn't want that kind of relationship. If he didn't do everything that she asked of him first, then he could lose himself in a more mundane world, like when he was a customer, and what was normal. There were three floors, and he wouldn't have to travel all the way to her office, just once every three weeks. He knew she liked him, just like he did. She'd be able to give him a reason too, and that was something he could get into.</p> <p>For the third meeting, he went up to the fifth floor and took her by one of the offices and took Ms. Martin's chair, sitting down for a minute.</p> <p>He wasn't sure what he wanted to do. If he just talked, or if he did everything he was thinking of doing, whatever that was, there was a possibility that she would ask him to come over after he did. Perhaps they would talk, or he could do the most awkward thing by telling her he was there before asking her, and offering her something to eat in a little place not far away. That gave him all three floors of the office. He couldn't sit there forever, though, he'd need to get to the fourth floor for the conversation. When he got to the fourth floor, he heard voices, and he guessed it would be the middle of the night. There were three floors, with four floors to get to. He'd probably have some work to do before he could get to her, but if he did that, he'd leave Ms. Martin alone, and then spend the night here, even though she did ask him to come over.</p> <p>He did get to the fourth floor, and found Ms. Martin waiting for him in the same way she always did, but this time, heâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
