Allie and I walked into the building, arm in arm. They talked as we approached the restaurant. It was on the third level of the building. They were both working as servers and all the other women had left. A good place, I thought, as our stomachs turned with hunger. When I got to the door, they opened it and invited me inside.</p> <p>The restaurant was crowded, with lots of tables and empty seats near the back. I saw all the women from the first two floors sitting at the little table; their heads turned toward the front door. Their hair was done up beautifully and they were wearing simple, almost black dresses. One girl sat at the back of the room, with a seat across from the other. The second table was near me, and it had a pretty good view of the crowd. As soon as I walked in, I knew I was going to need an escort. I looked at them, and realized they were wearing identical outfits, but the dress was different. I knew the dress was the type they wore as their hair was in a similar position.</p> <p>We talked about the business of the day, and how we might handle the business next year. My father would be a little surprised, but I told him what I knew. After spending the first half of the meal, some of my friends joined us. I had an overwhelming desire to do the same, but I knew the wait would only be for a few minutes in the waitingroom.</p> <p>We paid the bill on the way out, and took our table in a quiet corner near the front. I felt so alone I could have stayed there forever. My mind raced through every possible scenario I could think of, but each one left my heart beating faster. I paid the bill and we left the restaurant, leaving us to meet the rest of the group in the main building.</p> <p>My heart pounding, I followed them into the building, as they led me to the elevators. They asked me to follow, so it was just four steps. As soon as they were in the elevator, they turned to me and looked me up and down.</p> <p>"I want you," I said in a whisper.</p> <p>"I want you too," she said, and we walked to our room. "I'll wait for you at the door."</p> <p>This, I thought, could be the reason my heart was now beating so fast. I looked her up and down while we walked. Her body had no lines or wrinkles or tan lines, which were usually the case with women.</p> <p>I had the door open when we reached the room, and they closed the door behind us. The room was beautiful, and I almost felt safe there with three gorgeous women. For some reason, I felt a little ashamed. They led me to the bed, and we slid on the covers together and kissed each other. They had me lie on my back while they were still kissing. Then they moved down and took off my clothes. Before I knew it, they were both in front of me, and a pair of lips went to my nipples. I was almost breathless by the time they were done with me. I watched as my wife kissed me, and she seemed to enjoy tasting me. I wondered, again, what I'd gotten into with my wife's mouth on my breasts, but when she saw me, her face got even wilder. Her hand went to my crotch, which was already hard. I felt her hand inside the elastic band, and her large, thick fingers went right to my clit. I reached down with my hand and let out a little gasp. They kept rubbing that spot, and I was quickly becoming soaked. When I came, and their finger started to wiggle and push inside me, I felt a wave of excitement sweep over me. I was now aching for release. When the orgasm passed, they both went to the bed.</p> <p>To be continued....</p> <p>If you enjoyed the story, please contact me. I'd love to know if there are more like it, or if we all had great stories for next time.
