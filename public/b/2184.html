My cock, which hadn't quite fully harden, had taken on a new life, and I was feeling more than a little adventurous as she stroked the shaft. I began to wonder if she would do the same, but she surprised me again by putting the finger to her mouth and taking off my shirt. She then pulled off mine, stood up, and pushed my shirt the rest of the way off, leaving me in only a bra and slacks. It didn't bother me so much that anyone saw anything that wasn't covered by that or my bra, but that didn't hurt either, at all. After I removed my bra, and had a moment to marvel at the contrast between her small breasts and my own, and a little less of my bare, soft breasts.</p> <p>I noticed she was still in the same pose as earlier. But now that she was out of her own clothes, she had a whole other angle to me like one woman with a guy. I guess I looked a lot like her; I could see the side of her face, I think, through her lips... and then the other side. She was the same pale, smooth tone from before, except the color change was a whole new thing, as if she was a new woman. This was different with the way she was moving toward me, and I took the chance to put some more of my own body part into her sight, too.</p> <p>I was actually amazed that we'd have such interesting experiences to tell about, but then she brought herself down with another quick kiss on my lips, and I was getting the distinct impression that she was getting to like me more than I had to. I guess a lot had changed between us, because it looked like they were even getting along.</p> <p>She brought herself to me again, and I felt her fingers in my hair as she leaned down and kissed me for the third time, her tongue touching mine, playing with my lips. I ran my hands down her back, and she moved her hands into the hair around my shoulders. I'd heard that they were a lot like the other, not the same, but I never thought of it as bad, and after a short while she turned and we lay back up on the bed, our arms wrapping around each other and our legs overlapping.</p> <p>I saw that she was lying on her side, and, as I kissed her, I could feel something very different happening there. She kept kissing me, and I could feel her lips moving down my neck, on my shoulders, down over my breasts, and back as she got to my stomach. She continued to kiss me, moving lower and lower, until she reached the hair between her legs. My pussy was getting all wet, and her tongue danced over the edges of my mound, the tip searching, exploring, teasing. After a bit of kissing, she moved again to the top of my thighs, where her tongue was still exploring me. Now she put one hand firmly on each thigh, and, again, moved me toward the middle of the bed. I could feel her hot breath on me while her fingers toyed with me, her other hand holding the cheek of my pussy. I'd heard that there was some sort of arousal that people had in the clitoris, and I was glad she knew it. I was glad too.</p> <p>As I lay there between her legs, letting her tongue do all the work, I could have just kept licking her, but that might have been getting to her too much. Her other hand, which had been massaging my pussy while she kissed me, had slid down my body to my breasts. As she squeezed my pussy, I felt it tighten. This time, I had better control, and I put a finger to the clit at the same time she had and found it easily. It was just a little, but I had her breathing really quick.</p> <p>She kept licking me, and I could feel her tongue running up and down my slit again and again, and my clitoris got even harder, and I felt myself getting wetter. Her fingers and tongue, all the while, kept me wet and ready, and she could move them all around. My mind was in a fog, just a little, but it was like nothing before. Suddenly she pulled my hand to my mouth, and I could feel that my whole body was on fire, a different kind of lust than before. She didn't get up, however, as she was still above me. Instead, she positioned herself above me, straddling me, and she positioned my legs next to the bed.</p> <p>She put my face to her own breast, and she moved up and down on me, and I could feel the movements under her. I took the nipple into my mouth, and I could taste a little of something different. I could also feel theâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
