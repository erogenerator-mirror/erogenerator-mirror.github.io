I asked with a laugh. "He'll probably like it more than I'll," I warned.</p> <p>I watched him pull on the boxers before getting out of the shower, then walk toward the stairs. While he was in the shower, I changed out of my clothes, leaving the bra and thong on the floor while still wearing my robe.</p> <p>In the shower, I was already getting wet, which excited me just as much as it scared me. I wanted to run out the door and catch him in the hallway, but I knew it wouldn't happen. I still didn't want to fuck this man. After all, this was my brother and he was my lover. How could I even think about fucking him anymore because of this?</p> <p>When the man stepped out of the bathroom, I was already hard as a rock. I had fucked up and left by this time, but he was just in the room. I took a quick look to make sure his robe was closed, then stripped off my own clothes. I stood on the stairs and looked down at myself. I had a little more room than he did, though not enough to make a difference. The fact of the matter was I was already aroused, and now I was about to put on a show of some kind.</p> <p>I stepped onto the stairs, then began to walk to the middle of the room. I watched his eyes as his eyes traveled up from my breasts to my pussy, and then to my pussy again, leaving no doubt that what he was seeing, or seeing, was clearly the actual sex act itself. I wondered what he was looking at. Would he be able to believe it was happening from a distance? Had I become a wanton slut? Was my body already in the mood for sex? I reached out with my free hand, but hesitated as he watched, obviously curious about what he had seen, and how I looked.</p> <p>I reached down and began to touch myself, and soon my hands were making a wet spot on the thin material covering my pussy. I looked down at myself again, taking in every detail. I began to rub myself, moaning softly as each touch was felt by me. I closed my eyes once more and tilted my head back while I stroked myself and watched him as he smiled, watching me masturbate in front of him.</p> <p>"You're so wet," he chuckled as he watched my body rub faster. "You know...I could just tell..."</p> <p>I looked into his eyes and began to lick my lips before he nodded his head with approval.</p> <p>"I could just tell," I whispered.</p> <p>His smile widened as he looked down at me, then leaned down so he could kiss me.</p> <p>I wrapped myself around him tightly as he entered me, my hands holding onto his back desperately for more contact with my body. I could feel his cock pressing to me as he pushed in and out of me, sliding in and out.</p> <p>"I know if I did this again I'd never get to you in the shower, but the first time will always be with you."</p> <p>My eyes were closed, and my mouth moved against his as I felt him cum deep inside of me. He leaned back while his lips found mine before I could say anything, then closed the bathroom door quickly and went back to his own room. I finished shaving and cleaned up before slipping into his shirt and panties and putting on the robe.</p> <p>When I pulled up the stairs, my heart was beating so fast that it felt as if it had been stopped. My heart was pounding. I felt a burning feeling in my pussy as I walked back to my bedroom, and soon I was shaking and rubbing all over uncontrollably. My husband had already gone to bed. How could I let him get home in the middle of the day? I knew what I did to deserve my first time to be as good as I got. I'd wait and see; I did that all the time.</p> <p>I looked on the internet for him, which I thought should be easy. I typed the links into a search box, then opened the link to my phone and took a picture of myself. Even though my husband wasn't home, I was wearing my robe and I could hear the clock on the wall as I had on the walk-in closet. It had been almost two hours since I'd gone to bed, and I had just logged off to take a shower before slipping into the bed.</p> <p>I turned the water on and began to remove myself from the bed as I remembered my brother's words when he'd read about me.
