I was not in the mood for sex, so I suggested we go back to bed and do it again. We had been together for three weeks and I was getting tired of the teasing and all the teasing.</p> <p>She went upstairs to get her stuff and went into her bedroom. I took off my shirt and lay back on her bed with my dick already hard. I watched her as she walked back into the room. She was wearing a robe and was naked except for her shoes and socks. She had a beautiful face and gorgeous chest with nipples like pencil erasers. I took my dick in my hand and began to pump it as she came quietly to bed and kissed me. I went back to bed and lay there, watching her.</p> <p>About five minutes later she joined me on my bed and we slowly undressed until each of us were naked. We were in each other's arms for several minutes and then we began to kiss again. I found her very wet and we made slow gentle love all night long. I have never been able to get enough of that feeling of being with her.</p> <p>About three-quarters of the time, we had made love all night long and my dick was so hard it hurt. She seemed to have a hard time getting off other than that. I could feel it between my legs and we were so happy it took all my will power to restrain myself.</p> <p>About nine that evening, she asked what she had in mind for dinner. I told her I just wanted to get my dick in her pussy. She didn't object and we did a few minutes of passionate foreplay. Our eyes and our breathing told a different story. I was very horny and it showed in my big cock. I was really anxious to get into her hole. She didn't even ask, so I pushed her onto her back and slipped my hard-on between her legs. She was so wet and I knew she would be sore if I went any further.</p> <p>She didn't make any moves about whether or not I had a fat cock. She lay there enjoying the feel of my swollen body on top of hers. I looked down at her lovely body and thought, "This is it." We were going to do something wild, no regrets. We decided what we would do, and she did agree to go with me. I pulled back the sheet and spread her legs. I began to lick her and we fucked for about two minutes until we both came several orgasms before she squirted all over my face.</p> <p>We got up and went to her bedroom completely naked. She dropped the sheet on the floor and I began to lick all of her pussy juice off the sheets as she did. We continued to make love and lick and kiss for several minutes before I finally slid my hard cock into her beautiful body. She was snug in the middle and it was impossible for me to do anything but go with her. I held her tight and it felt so wonderful in her. I never knew sex could feel so good. After a good five minutes of deep pounding I just couldn't control myself again. We made love for quite a few seconds until we were both exhausted.</p> <p>We got dressed and I picked her up at my hotel and she invited me to the wedding the following Saturday. I was anxious to talk to her about our relationship. We made plans to meet at the wedding to go over plans for the night when we got there. She was also going to be there and the wedding was going to be at the country club and the reception was going to be at the hotel. I told her I had never been to a wedding of any kind in my life and that I looked forward to meeting her.</p> <p>I told her that we had made love many times and I had never felt better. She told me she felt wonderful and we ended our relationship the next day with a kiss. It was a special date that we would both remember. We also promised a special night so we could both start over againâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
