I need a drink to relax," I explained, hoping against the hope that she wouldn't ask me to get up, though I didn't think much of it.</p> <p>"Yes you may," she agreed, leaving me to sort out what I was going to do.</p> <p>My stomach began to rumble loudly at the thought that I'd actually gone through with it. If she didn't give me the drink, it would give me the chance to see how badly I wanted to see my wife getting drunk! She wouldn't be angry, and she already was.</p> <p>I poured myself one, and sipped it slowly, before finally sitting down to survey the situation as it began to dawn on me. The glass was very, very cool, much less than what I had been drinking. Not only was I getting cold, she was getting a much warmer drink when she came to and drank all that, but the ice cubes had disappeared. She must have decided that this ice drink was the least of my worries, so she left it on, and came back and sat on my lap as the effects of the cold subsided.</p> <p>"I don't even think that I could make you something stronger. That would be really, really..." she shook her head at me. "A lot stronger," she repeated. "I don't drink that much; a lot more."</p> <p>"It's okay, you should drink. You're probably just drunk and happy and happy right now." She shrugged it off, smiling as she walked back over to the desk. There were papers in hand. It was all of them, from birth certificates and all that, but there were definitely a few more than I thought they were going to be. There were only a few on the sheet, and I didn't need to see them all. I smiled over to her when I got to work, feeling relieved the stress on her shoulders had been relieved.</p> <p>After finishing my first cup, she took another and another and was getting pretty drunk, and I was sure she was feeling the same. She'd never been a big drinker, but she wasn't too out of control. She had never been afraid to drink. That had to be her favorite thing to do. She wasn't an alcoholic.</p> <p>The first cup seemed to help her loosen up her legs, and then her fingers became her hands. Soon her breathing was becoming slower. When she was drinking as high as she did with me, it really felt pretty good. But then, just as she was starting my third cup, she became unsteady. She began to sit on my lap as I stood there, and when she saw my hand and looked over at me, I let her drink.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, sweetheart, I thought this would be a bad time," I apologised, reaching over and patting her on the cheek. "It was going to be so easy. I didn't realize how drunk I was until I could."</p> <p>She looked down at herself, and I could see that her face was flushed, but the bright red and red in her cheeks seemed more intense. I leaned over and kissed her just as hard as our first kiss had been. The kiss felt so natural with me, and I could see that she wasn't just drunk, and she was definitely feeling a lot of the same things that I was.</p> <p>I held her in my arms as I finished my last cup, but she didn't seem to be too upset. Instead she leaned over and began to kiss me again. Her soft, sweet lips were very warm. They felt like strawberries on my cheek as she gently pressed her lips all over my mouth, leaving her tongue caressing the bottom of my mouth. I felt my dick begin to stiffen at the sight of her soft breasts brushing against me, with my hands rubbing her back. It felt like every cell in my body wanted to have her pressed to me, pressing herself to me.</p> <p>"Oh God, I'm going to have to fuck you," I groaned into her mouth, holding her back from me.</p> <p>"Do the other one," she answered and I helped her off from my lap, kissing her softly again. We ended up on the couch, and she knelt before me, holding the bottle of wine.</p> <p>"I can't," she sighed as she pulled down the last of the wine glass on my lap. "I'm not ready to make another commitment to a committed relationship yet."</p> <p>"Don't say that," I told her gently, watching her face as she handed me the bottle. "It's not me it's just you and I. It can't be anyone else; besides, you've already screwed me over enough for the both of us. Besides, just as long as you're with me, I can't see a way to screw youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
