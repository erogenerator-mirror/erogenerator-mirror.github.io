The pleasure he felt was more than he expected as he watched his own reflection as it formed in his vision.</p> <p>"Mmm..." he moaned after having his eyes on the sight of his cock and the beautiful sight of it.</p> <p>Sara slowly lowered herself down until her ass was just inches from his face. She began to slowly lower herself, feeling the head of his cock as it emerged from the side of her thigh. Her legs trembled, and she bit her lip as she felt his cock brush against her pussy. She bit harder as she felt a wave of pleasure wash over her body as she looked down at her own reflection staring back over her shoulder. Without prompting she slowly lowered herself down even further, completely engulfing his cock as his hand began to slowly stroke the length of its full length.</p> <p>Sara moaned as her legs trembled, feeling the pressure of her own pussy against her face as its flesh brushed against her cheek as she felt her own orgasm begin to build again. The feel of Aidan's cock against her cheek sent her higher as she took the risk to lean her head forward towards him, feeling his hand on her lower back as she leaned over his cock.</p> <p>"Aidan..." she began to breathe as he continued to stroke himself with the soft skin of one hand as he continued to stroke the other hand across her back. He pressed his thumb into the small of her back and rubbed himself against her. She felt herself begin to melt as she looked over her shoulder, seeing him stare back at her. The thrill of his hands on her body as he looked at her overwhelmed her with pleasure. His thumb pressed slightly deeper into her as she looked at his smile. With her head down Aidan began to gently rub his thumb over her clit as she leaned her body closer to his. As he began to stroke himself against her he pressed the tip of his thumb into her entrance as he continued to rub her clit. Her back arching as she began to move herself back against him and feel his cock press the lips of her pussy gently against his shaft.</p> <p>Faster Aidan rubbed himself against her as he looked at her with a smile on his face. She looked up at him shyly as her tongue began to slide across her lips. He slid his thumb along her clit, as she started to lightly rub it between his fingers. A soft moan escaped from her lips as she felt his touch against her. Without breaking eye contact she looked over her shoulder at herself again, the pleasure she felt at seeing the look of pleasure on her own face was so intense. She reached down towards his cock and began to rub it against her pussy as he leaned back and stared down at her.</p> <p>"I-," she began to stammer. His cock was so warm against her pussy as she rubbed it against herself. "Mmm...I'm ok...I'm not sure..." the sound of her begging for help escaping her lips was enough to start Aidan's cock begin to twitch in her hand.</p> <p>Sara moaned again into her mouth as he lifted her onto his cock slowly. She began to slide up and down on the length of his penis as he slid her down towards him, feeling herself slowly slide all the way up and down his length as he stood above her. As if on autopilot she continued sliding up and down on his shaft as the pleasure built inside her. Aidan grabbed her hips and began to gently thrust his shaft upwards as he watched her eyes as she tried to look away from him. He was surprised by the look on her face as the sensations of his shaft rubbing against her clit, her moans and the sensations she was experiencing on herself were bringing her closer and closer to the edge. With one finger her index finger began to slide down her front towards her pussy.</p> <p>"Stop..." he moaned as he looked down into her eyes as he continued to gently pump his cock against her. He could see a look of ecstasy on her face as he felt himself getting closer to the edge and felt that rush of pleasure rising in him as he looked down at her.</p> <p>Aidan didn't want to move just yet because he wanted to see what she would do while he was close to orgasm. He looked in her eyes to try to see how far she would go as he placed his thumb on her clit and began to slowly rub against it with his two fingers.</p> <p>Sara moaned from behind him as he slowly rubbed her clit as she leaned back to watch his hands moving over himself as he rubbed her gently. Just moments before it was no more than a soft stroke with his fingers just brushing against her clit. Feeling it lightly brushed against her fingertips she let her breathing become slightly heavier as she watched him. Aidan looked down into her eyesâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
