I didn't think I could look that well when I was on top of you, because I was in a daze. There was a moment when I thought I was going to be able to resist him. But I did. I did anything for him.</p> <p>Then it happened again. My body shuddered. "OH! Oh!" I said between gritted teeth. I thought I'll be able to move. My whole body was shaking. I tried to lift my head but my body was paralyzed. I just wanted it. My body was covered in sweat. My lips were dry. Sweat broke out on my forehead. Every muscle in my body was on fire and my heart hammered furiously in my chest. I looked around me. I looked for the best position, but never seemed to find one. All I had to do was wait. The minutes passed. I had to be near him. My body was still shaking. I wanted to move, but my body said no. The moment for me seemed never to end. Everything was like a dream.</p> <p>He was kneeling next to me, his fingers exploring the soft warmth of my body. I turned my head to avoid his gaze. I closed my eyes and fell over the top of the pillow. I had the biggest orgasm of my life. My body started shaking uncontrollably. My body shuddered like a hurricane. I was having no control over the situation, or the feeling.</p> <p>"I'm sorry," I mumbled through my nose, "that was too much. I didn't know what was happening."</p> <p>"No, you didn't know it. You should have come in, or I had been too selfish and had lost control of you."</p> <p>"You're so beautiful, so beautiful," he said smiling, "You are going to make me very happy. You are a beautiful woman, and you are very special. It's going to happen." He touched the part of my face he touched. "Are you okay? Do you want to be happy?"</p> <p>"Yeah. I want to be happy. It's very important to me that you're my best friend."</p> <p>"Yes, everything is wonderful. I just didn't know what you were capable of. You don't have to feel bad. I'm glad you didn't feel that terrible." I looked up at him but continued thinking of nothing else. I felt weak, weak and weak. "Do you remember the last time you saw someone you really liked? You didn't see how beautiful I was? You never saw people that way, did you?"</p> <p>"No." I couldn't meet his eyes, I just shook my head and nodded. "I can see you now. I love you."</p> <p>"Yes," he said. "I love you. And I'm so happy to be here with you." He stroked my face and let his lips come to mine in a kiss that surprised me. I melted into him and I felt myself melting into him too. I felt a great weight hanging in his arms and I knew for a fact he was strong enough to carry me easily. I didn't care. Our kiss was long and meaningful. He kissed me like I had kissed her on her birthday. He kissed me the way a boyfriend kisses a girl who is so happy. I loved him. I loved me.</p> <p>We remained connected for hours, touching lips everywhere. I wanted to open my eyes, but he wasn't there yet. I wanted to see how much of the last twenty three hours I'd had in one instant. I didn't care. I wanted his approval to me. I liked his eyes but I wanted him to keep touching me. I was ready to give him his acceptance.</p> <p>We held each other for what seemed like eternity. Finally we broke our kiss. We had to get moving but we didn't want to risk getting caught by neighbors.</p> <p>"That was so wonderful," I managed to say.</p> <p>"You are so beautiful." He said. He was moving with a passion I hadn't seen in him in ten years. I felt like an innocent.</p> <p>"You're not so innocent," I smiled. "I've always been nice. So you see, we aren't innocent. We're beautiful, and I love you." This declaration was really exciting. I had never before had a moment to myself like this in my entire life.</p> <p>"I love you, too," he continued, "And I'll be in love with you. Now I don't care. What we have is wonderful. It's not like we have been doing this before." He leaned in for another kiss. I felt a shiver run through me. He was holding me to him, kissing me for the very first time. He was moving with the rhythm of a trance. It was a very strange feeling.</p> <p>"If we take a breakâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
