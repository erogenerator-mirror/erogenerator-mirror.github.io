"It's just..." she looked up at him with soft eyes as her hand cupped around the head. "Just... like you'll never feel it again."</p> <p>"Mmm, I guess that means... you're going to be..."</p> <p>"I'll never be just like you." She leaned as far forward with her body as possible, trying to take his cock into her mouth without pulling it straight out of her. All he could do was stand there as she bobbed her head up and down on him with increasing enthusiasm, her hands running slowly up and down his shaft as her soft lips massaged his head with soft strokes. She used her tongue as though she was licking a cock, sometimes swirling her mouth all over the head, sometimes swallowing until she pulled it back down her throat, her tongue swirling around the head before she pulled back to swirl her tongue all over it.</p> <p>His head bounced around as she sucked him, feeling him get even harder in her mouth as she stroked him like she wanted him to be doing. He never felt anything quite like it, it was as though he were being sucked off against the soft lips and tongue of another female. He never thought he would have anything to do with two girls sucking his cock but then his imagination was on the point of being filled up. It wasn't long before he couldn't imagine any reason not to do it, not to be the one to pleasure this hot little pussy.</p> <p>Her moaning, a low growl that sounded like a horse's high pitch, told him she had had enough. She sat back up again to look up at him, "I... don't want to come yet..." she pouted as she reached down to gently stroke his cock, feeling it bounce as it came to attention, then she leaned forward towards him, his cock sliding easily into her mouth, feeling the warmth of her lips wrapped around him as he came to rest against her tongue. She wrapped her arms around his legs and brought her mouth down to take him into her pussy.</p> <p>He felt her lips wrap around his penis and her tongue run up and down his swollen cock. She tasted good too, the slight tangier flavour filling his mouth, as his mind filled up with images of her tight pussy wrapped around his cock. Their bodies were moving in unison like they had done before as she moved back and forth on top of him, fucking him with every inch of her pussy. "Oh my... that was..." she purred as they got closer, as she continued to thrust herself up and down on him, feeling his shaft slide into her. "Mmm, that was nice...." her words were interrupted by him groaning and thrusting his hips up to meet her, the tip of his cock meeting her soft lips as he came more into her mouth...</p> <p>"Mmm... I don't want to... come before I even let you go."</p> <p>"Oh god," she purred as she continued to play with his balls, pulling him down until they were against her as she rode him while leaning back onto the bed, her legs hooked over his head, his weight balanced on the bed. As she continued to use him as her own personal fuck toy, he felt himself start to come as well, the sensation of coming even if it was only in his balls making him harder then before.</p> <p>"Mmm, I think... I think it's a good idea." She smiled as his cock was starting to soften in her mouth before sucking on it gently. "It's not exactly..." her voice trailed off as she looked up at him with her hazel eyes.</p> <p>"I can't go back to my own room if you keep doing that," he assured her, his tone of voice betraying how he felt about this. "I need to go make sure the coast is clear, it's been really too long."</p> <p>"Oh I will, sweetie," she leaned back to wrap her arms around his legs. "But not before we make sure it doesn't get any better than that."</p> <p>"How should we do that?" he thought with a wicked grin before he looked down at her and smiled. She smiled back at him as he laid on the bed on his back, the sheets making him look even more as though he was naked. "What's the matter with me?" he asked, his voice catching as the tone of his voice was more teasing than it actually was.</p> <p>"Oh, nothing," her hands were on his chest now, lightly pinching his nipples, making him moan before continuing, "You're not as young as you thought you would be, and that would make a perfect excuse to make sure I do what I want with my body..." her voice trailed off as he pulled her onto his erection, wrapping his hands around her waistâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
