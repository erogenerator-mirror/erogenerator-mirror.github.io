He was rubbing a finger over and between her now swollen lips as his tongue entered her mouth. He had never seen a woman so wet.</p> <p>"Fuck, he's going to make me cum," she whispered with a small tremble in her voice. "Oh God..." she continued as his tongue found hers and her body began to tense as the first wave of orgasm hit her. He stopped to catch his breath and continued tonguing her as she went wild on his tongue.</p> <p>"You like to be licked, don't you honey?" he asked.</p> <p>"I have loved it."</p> <p>He lowered her to the floor so that he could kiss and lick as she reached between her legs again. He brought her legs up on his shoulders as he began to slowly rock his dick back and forth as he rubbed it against her opening. He had just slid inside her pussy when they heard a tap on the door. "Shit!" they both said simultaneously.</p> <p>Without saying a word, they both moved around and quickly closed the door leaving the door ajar. He sat down on the toilet to pee and when he was finished, he looked into the mirror. She was still wearing her panties even though he had finished his shower before he left for work. She had pulled them on over the thong and they still looked as transparent though they were a little damp from the shower earlier. He began to laugh thinking about their first kiss when she said "Don't forget that you can touch me too." So they both got their panties back on and left the bathroom. As they were leaving the bathroom, she whispered to him that she was going to make him a very special dinner and she hoped he wouldn't mind being in her.</p> <p>They got to the restaurant first and they were seated. The host said that they would meet at the back of the table when dinner was served and they both knew it wasn't to go there. He told them later that he knew from previous experience that their table would be reserved for a special occasion. As he was about to go to the restroom to put the order in, they both stood up to go. As soon as he was out of the door, they embraced and french kissed. His dick was already getting hard so it went straight between her legs. She reached down and felt it and then spread it wide.</p> <p>"That's right! You are always so hard and that's just to please me," she cooed as he pushed her back on the table. The waitress came right away and asked if they wanted dessert as she handed him the bill.</p> <p>"Oh yes please!" she said with a big smile.</p> <p>They sat down and he had the first piece of toast. It was delicious and so was the taste. As soon as he was done eating, they both stood up and he turned her around so that she was bent over the table. She reached back and pulled her skirt up over her ass exposing her sweet rear end. He grabbed a handful of her long silky dress and slowly slid his hand up to her naked crotch. As soon as his hand touched her pussy, she moaned as she felt him start to stroke her opening.</p> <p>"Mmmm! That is wonderful. If you do not play this right, I may make this into a threesome," he said teasingly as his finger worked her slit.</p> <p>"You wouldn't dare!" she said playfully.</p> <p>"I think there are other places you can do it," he said with a devious smile. He slowly lowered himself between her legs and pressed his fully hard dick inside her as he lowered himself to sit on her thighs. He began to slowly pump himself in and out of her pussy as he leaned back to enjoy her as they sat there. She loved it so the first time he came inside her with just his dick touching her. They kissed passionately again as his balls emptied their load deep inside her belly. His dick slipped out of her pussy with a loud "plop" as he looked down at her.</p> <p>"You know, if you were my lover, I would like to do things to you," he said as he took off his top and her own top. "Would you do that for me?" he asked, as he ran his hand across her beautiful tits.</p> <p>"Oh my yes, I would love to feel you all the time," she replied. After just seconds, she reached behind her and began to untie the strings holding her skirt on. He reached up and helped her off with it. By the time she was free it fell down between them and the two stood for a moment before he looked her in the eyes again and then led her back to their table.</p> <p>They both stood up and once again made eye contact as they took the seat in the back.
