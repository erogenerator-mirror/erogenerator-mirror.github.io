He pulled his hand away almost instantly and she gasped as he touched her skin with his fingers.</p> <p>He kissed her lips again and she whimpered as he teased her with his teeth. ‘You’re so wet.’</p> <p>‘Oh’, she moaned as she pushed against him and the contact caused a new wave of heat to rush up her body. He was driving her crazy.</p> <p>‘You can’t take too much of that right now’, he cautioned</p> <p>‘Don’t stop.’</p> <p>He moved a finger between her moist lips and probed at her tiny clit. She gasped as he pushed against her. He pulled his hand away and she gasped again as his fingers moved up and over her engorged clit. She was so turned on.</p> <p>‘Oh that’s good’, she murmured against his lips, but he had other plans for her.</p> <p>He lifted his head and she opened her eyes.</p> <p>‘You’ll have to tell me what to do’, she said, but she wasn’t going to say any words.</p> <p>Her lips tightened around his as he slowly, almost slowly, pushed his fingers into her body. He stopped a second before he could feel that she was ready, and slowly pulled his fingers from her body.</p> <p>‘Not quite there…’</p> <p>He slowly lowered her onto the bed. She sat up, her knees still splayed and his fingers still in her as she looked up at him. ‘Do you have a condom?’</p> <p>‘You bet’, he softly teased as he reached for his wallet. She gasped as he slipped the condom on and he moved it to his shaft.</p> <p>‘Are you OK’, she smiled as he slowly thrust his body down.</p> <p>They began to make love like it had never been done before. His body moved around hers, his hips thrusting in all the right places and she responded as he pulled from her body and moved his body up hers.</p> <p>‘I love you,’, he whispered to her and his arms wrapped over her body and he pulled her back against him as they made love.</p> <p>‘And I love you’, she whispered softly in his ear as her tongue circled it. He slowly thrust his hips in and out of her, causing the bed to move with their rhythmic movements.</p> <p>‘Oh yes’, she moaned. ‘Oh yes’, he whispered as he pulled her hips back to meet his, as his thighs slammed against hers again and again. She arched against his body as he held her against him.</p> <p>‘I love you too’, she moaned, as she moved her hips into his.</p> <p>‘I love every part of you’, she said as she held him close to the bed, their bodies sliding over each other as he held her tightly.</p> <p>‘I love you’, he whispered, as he held her hips tightly against his.</p> <p>‘I love you more,’ she groaned as her passion built toward a peak; then stopped as she climaxed. He felt her shaking and heard her gasp as he continued to thrust into her as she climaxed again.</p> <p>‘I love you’, he whispered as he thrust into her.</p> <p>‘You’ve brought me so much joy’.</p> <p>‘I’ve brought you so much joy’, she croaked as she held him close, her fingers running through his hair.</p> <p>‘I’ve brought you so much more pleasure than you can possibly imagine’.</p> <p>‘I’ve brought you so much pleasurably,’, she moaned as she felt herself start to drift and fall into a dreamlike state as her mind melted into a whirl of light and darkness.</p> <p>‘I want you to be pleased too’, he murmured as he shifted to straddle her.</p> <p>‘Come on,’ she sighed.</p> <p>He had no intentions of taking her to the heights of passion she now craved and desired. She needed to feel him inside her. ‘Please don’t put it in me, just let me cum’.</p> <p>‘I will’, he promised with a wicked grin as he started to thrust into her body.</p> <p>‘Yes, oh, yes, oh yes’, she panted. ‘Do me, do me, please.�—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
