He turned to look on his way to the bus. Then he heard a scream and saw a huge hand flying out to grab him. They stood in the middle of the car, his face twisted in a hateful mask.</p> <p>"What the hell are you doing up here...!" He began to laugh.</p> <p>"Who the fuck is that?! What the fuck are you laughing about?!!" The man growled at them!</p> <p>The big man held the terrified man up. The man looked up startled, but no one came to break his hold on the terrified man.</p> <p>"I, uh, I saw this one," The man said, he held up a large, dark-skinned woman.</p> <p>"Wait... What the fuck...What in God's name did you do to me? I'm a fucking monster!" The man spat.</p> <p>The women both stood and looked at the man. His huge, handsome face gave off a smile of amusement at a girl who appeared to be walking beside him, one arm twisted in a big smile.</p> <p>The man leaned closer. "You know what I love, don't you?"</p> <p>The woman nodded, "Oh yes..."</p> <p>The large man grinned back, "What were you waiting for? Do you think you could take all this...and more, so I might as well get me my bag? You know, and bring some clothes, so I can put these in your room." He turned away as soon as he said it. The woman stood and gave him a glare.</p> <p>The man smiled again. "Look, he likes you... He thinks I'm cute."</p> <p>The woman nodded. "Thank you. And you?"</p> <p>"It's nice, and I'm gonna thank you later. Now go." He began to get out of the car.</p> <p>The larger, stronger man said, "Don't take your hands off him... Don't touch him... Don't look at him, or don't even say, 'hello'." He turned away.</p> <p>The woman nodded and started to follow him.</p> <p>"Go on," the man said, "Don't fight me!"</p> <p>"Come on... "</p> <p>The man pointed at the man and took out his wallet. He handed two twenties to the man.</p> <p>"Here. Give these to me, and then I'll buy you dinner." As he said that, he turned back and began walking away, his huge eyes on the tall woman as she took his hand.</p> <p>The man shook his head. "You're such a slut! I never thought you were that kind of man... Well, you just keep trying to get me, maybe you'll learn... Or you get me, just for yourself. I don't care." he walked off, he turned back towards the car.</p> <p>Then he was gone.</p> <p>He walked in and turned on the television, so it went to the left. He sat himself in the passenger seat. "Come on in," he began.</p> <p>A long moment passed. Then he started. "I don't know how long I can keep this up. I'm getting so tired. You've known me for a good part of a year. I can't stay this way, no more then a few weeks... Maybe a couple more maybe."</p> <p>He looked at the woman and her friend then reached over and put her hand in his own. "I don't think so. Come on."</p> <p>The woman followed him into the house. She followed the man into the kitchen. "So?" he asked.</p> <p>"So, I guess, after that one... I might need more then a night out..."</p> <p>"No. Not a night out..." He turned to her. "Oh, and by the way..." The man had closed the door.</p> <p>"Can you help me with dinner? My father will kill me."</p> <p>"What! Why, he's not going to..."</p> <p>"No, he won't. We've gone this far already and he's not going to get any more of anything from you. It's time you got used to it."</p> <p>"Oh, god." She began to cry, her face turned up towards him. "I... I never told you this, you bastard."</p> <p>He laughed softly against her hair. "No, I have told you several times," he continued. "And one time I got really mad, and I had to let you go. But don't worry about me, I'm in control of myself now. You have no control over this situation." He put his hand against her cheek. "It won't happen again."</p> <p>The man smiled at his words. "Well, you have it now." He touched her face with his fingers. Then he turned and walked out the door, locking it behind himâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
