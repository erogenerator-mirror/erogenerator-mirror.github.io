It's been here before."</p> <p>"But are you in a different room?" A voice in his voice made it through his gritted teeth.</p> <p>"No," he growled, "you can't even move, I'll get you again."</p> <p>A hand came down on his face and he winced. In the next moment he grabbed his arm, causing it to flinch and bite into his hand, "I am not going back to the fuckin' house!"</p> <p>"The kids?"</p> <p>"You don't understand," his head spun around, "I was just a couple of guys. A couple of friends; and..."</p> <p>"That's all?" the man holding his arm snarled, "And that is nothing."</p> <p>He let go of his anger and stood up, grabbing her wrist. He glared at her sternly but didn't let go.</p> <p>"I'm not going back to the goddamn fuckin' house!"</p> <p>"Oh, no you aren't," her hand was grabbed and she was pulled out by her hair. "I'm not leaving you!"</p> <p>He let go of her mouth roughly, "It's not like that." He took his free hand off her chin and brought her mouth down to his and forced it into hers. She struggled but it was futile since she kept her eyes closed and she didn't see what was happening.</p> <p>"I didn't tell you to make a move on me," he said as he kissed her roughly.</p> <p>"It's not like that," she whispered and then whimpered.</p> <p>He felt her body react, so he backed off and kissed the skin of her nose. He then kissed her lips lightly and she opened to him. He then kissed her gently. "I'm not going to make this one easy," she whimpered.</p> <p>He then kissed her lips again, "It's not easy. Go back home."</p> <p>She sighed and then took a long deep breath and then did the same thing over and over again. She was struggling to talk back. She wanted to ask what was going on, but she didn't want to speak.</p> <p>"Please?" she moaned, "Please don't make me go back to the fuckin' place. The damn cops will see us."</p> <p>"Don't you dare tell them I sent you here," he commanded again and she whimpered again, looking at him over her shoulder expectantly.</p> <p>He chuckled when she refused to answer. "They don't have to. That would be too embarrassing; I won't tell the cops."</p> <p>"I know. I was just kidding," she said.</p> <p>He frowned, and then smiled. "No, no way. You're not going back home. If you do you will be going back to the fuckin' house in the next town; but if you stay here I might just send the cops."</p> <p>She gave him a look that said 'They won't believe you're in the neighborhood; because your parents are dead; you can come back here whenever you want; and I'm sure your father won't tell them you're in a fuckin' city somewhere.'</p> <p>With that he kissed her again. She returned the kiss with fervent passion and they kissed and kissed for a long while, until she was finally able to open her eyes again and look into his eyes from between them, and he had his eyes closed.</p> <p>"There's some wine and cheese in there," she said and went back to the living room. She heard him walk away and then he was standing outside. Without breaking eye contact she got up. She grabbed some dry clothes and then went back to the living room and sat down on the reclining couch. She started off by putting her head on the arm of the couch, making sure she didn't have to look anywhere else.</p> <p>'It's not easy to be on an island,' she mused to herself. 'And I'm not going to have to live out another fucking nightmare on my own.' He came in and sat down in the corner of the couch. He took his boots off and went back to the television and started it up again. She got up and started to go to the kitchen to get some more wine for the occasion.</p> <p>She knew from prior experience that he liked his sex with her to be slow and controlled, so this time she didn't want her sex to be slow. She sat down next to him and watched what he was watching. She began to feel kind of horny, wanting to give her body over to him. She got comfortable sitting on his lap and began to feel turned on. He started kissing her neck and neck. As he did this he began to grope her. She put her hand on his thigh and began to rubâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
