I was starting to feel uncomfortable so I left. The guy wasn't that good either but I was having a hard time not wanting to be alone because right about then he yelled, "Look what you did! I am going to pay you a lot more than $4000." He started screaming and I ran out. I thought he was going to be pissed and I couldn't figure out where she got to. I didn't bother to say anything but said I was going to go back home. He gave me a big slap and said I could call him as soon as I got into my car because I wanted to see that beautiful cock of yours."</p> <p>After a little more yelling, yelling and finally begging him to get up and leave, I was sitting on the edge of the bed just looking out the window at the stars. I just smiled up at him. It wasn't until I started looking at the clock that I realized I had to get home to my hubby that he hadn't gotten home. As soon as I got back to my room, I started feeling really weird. I couldn't get out of bed and just sat there for a while. It wasn't until after that I realized I hadn't called or called him. About an hour later, I heard him outside. I just stayed there for a while, then I went back in the room and sat there for a while. He must have been getting ready to leave because he left on his own for a while. Just for once I decided not to go over to him just to see if I could call him. I wanted to just go home and try to get to sleep so bad that I would come so hard I would pass out! As soon as I sat down I heard him crying.</p> <p>After two hours I started to realize that I was starting to get really upset so I just went to bed. On the other side I would have a hard time falling asleep. On my left was a piece of paper and in that piece of paper was a note. I took a quick look at the note then went to turn it over, but he never answered it. I don't think he left the note out in my room the entire evening. I guess he liked seeing the note.</p> <p>The next morning started off nice. I didn't get home until early. When I got home I just lay and think of how happy I was that we could be together. I realized that all he would have to do was wait a week and then leave. Now I really wanted to see his cock! I got up and headed for the bedroom and went back down to bed. As I went to get ready for work, he called while I was showering.</p> <p>"Hi, Honey! How are you?"</p> <p>Well, when you start thinking about it, I mean no, that was just a stupid lie. It wasn't just him. I know that sounded stupid but as it turned out it was his story. The next day it didn't help that I decided to wear some pretty revealing outfits. I had a short skirt over a button up blouse and a knee length skirt that just came almost up to my crotch. I thought that I would be a little daring so that he would enjoy it. I also put on a pair of very high heels. I wanted to be as sexy as possible to make him think I was a pretty bad girl. As it was my husband I knew better but he didn't even ask about it. It was just as well because he couldn't stop looking at me! As I got finished showering I slipped into one of his clothes that he hadn't given me to wear. It was kind of cute but I knew he wouldn't be able to handle it. I don't know if he thought the outfit made me look cheap then but it wasn't going to help my hubby's feelings either.</p> <p>I got home at about the same time he did and went straight for my dinner plate with three plates. When I took my shower I looked at that wonderful hot steaming water. I couldn't wait to get that off of me and onto the table so that it rubbed and warmed all over my body. I got into the shower after taking care of cleaning myself. I did everything but shampoo my hair and that's where I made sure I took my time shaving all of my body hair off. A little later that night I got a new razor and some lather. I really put the razor in the razorber's bag and carried all of the shaving foam and shave cream for my body.</p> <p>A couple of days after my trip to the hospital I picked up some fresh sheets for him to put on. When I put the fresh sheets on he started to pull them up to his shoulders. "Let me do that."</p> <p>"No! You don't do that."</p> <p>"Why?"</p> <p>"Just stop pulling the sheets up."</p> <p>"The hospital isâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
