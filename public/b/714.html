Your sister might be able to help. The last thing I need is another boyfriend."</p> <p>"She probably isn't. She says this is only my second time, and she isn't very experienced. She's a real nerd."</p> <p>"Yeah, whatever. Do you want to try out a girl yet?" I asked. "I mean, she seems like a real cool chick; she can handle me. She's got a bit of a reputation she, um, she didn't really bring up."</p> <p>"Yeah, maybe. Maybe," she replied.</p> <p>On Monday, when I got done with my last class of the afternoon, I went to a friend's house to pick my roommates up at 6:30 pm. It only took a half hour.</p> <p>At 6:45 pm my friends were waiting for me. It looked like a typical college hangout, which I thought was a little unusual for something so unusual. But I told them I was ready when they got there.</p> <p>I opened one door, and found my roommate, Nicole, standing at the open front door.</p> <p>"It's great," she said in a voice full of sadness and relief. "I know you wouldn't last a minute, but you look so much like that geek on that old science channel last month!"</p> <p>"Thanks Nicole."</p> <p>"I can't wait to see you tomorrow," she said with a smile.</p> <p>I could not believe how happy I was. Here I was, on my first trip through another college, with a girl who was still my friend's roommate. I hoped to see a lot more of her over the next few times I got together with her.</p> <p>She came out from behind her open bedroom door and took my hand, leading me inside.</p> <p>As we entered the living room, she turned and leaned her back against my back. Her skirt was pulled up and she was wearing her pink top. It seemed like an awfully conservative, conservative outfit, but it was clearly in contrast with the rest of her ensemble. She was wearing white thigh-high stockings, with a matching garter belt, and a cute black lace push-up bra. She put her hands on her hips and gave me a little shake.</p> <p>"I have never wanted to get a man in such a desperate mood," she said softly. "I just don't know if I can go along with this. There's something not right about it"</p> <p>"Me, too," I said. I had no idea what she was talking about. I had always felt like I was in love with her. It had always bothered me before, but this time, I knew the reason for it; her, it was just sex.</p> <p>"I just don't know if I'm ready to risk it," she said. "I've always figured you would be more like a brother or a lover, but I just can't believe how much more you've become."</p> <p>"You're right," I said. "This is crazy."</p> <p>"You don't like boys," she asked. "Are you sure this can actually be for real?"</p> <p>"I don't know," I said, unsure what to say.</p> <p>"Let's find someone else," she said as she grabbed the doorknob to my friend's home.</p> <p>"Come on," Nicole said as she led me up the stairs. "We'll just make it through."</p> <p>She unlocked the door to her master bedroom, turning the light off right away. The last room in the house had two beds, one of which was on one side and one on the other. I stood there nervously, not wanting to break any rules. I didn't know what to expect, but apparently Nicole's plan worked.</p> <p>"Are you sure you're ready?" she asked, standing in the middle of the room. It was one of those antique-looking, three-post guest bed-pan in the bedroom.</p> <p>"Yeah," I replied.</p> <p>"This will be perfect," she said. "It will give us a little space."</p> <p>Just thinking of the way she held my hands made my body tingle, and I couldn't wait to do it again.</p> <p>She walked over to the side of the bed and said "Just do it and go," as she began to unbuckle my pants, looking at me as she did it.</p> <p>I thought "okay, go," as she dropped my pants to the floor. My underwear followed by my panties were soon on the floor as well, followed by my dress shoes. I looked at her quizzically: she turned around and was facing me with an exaggerated pout.</p> <p>"Are you sure this's okay with you?" sheâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
