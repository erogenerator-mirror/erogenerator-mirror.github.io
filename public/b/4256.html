I got on my knees and started in on her from the kneeling position; we both stared at her mouth and saw her eyes. I kissed the side of her cheek and slowly brought my head close to her mouth. A big smile started to start to form on her lips, and her whole body twitched.</p> <p>"What's your name?" she said, and her body was twitching slightly, but this time she didn't try to pull away. I ran my tongue up her inner right one, and down again. Her breathing increased in intensity, and I went down her side, around her neck and across her breasts and belly; her nipples were growing. The lips of her mouth parted and her tongue came out, lapping the lips of the pink pearl. She sucked on it for a long minute, then opened in to me and I sucked on it for a minute, and let it settle; it was sweet and sweet tasting.</p> <p>I stopped and she let it go, and I got on my knees and knelt in front of her.</p> <p>"Let's start with your boobs," I said, and she opened her arms wide, and my fingers went to her right breast, which made her gasp. I went to the nipple of her left one, and started to suck.</p> <p>"Oh my," she said, with a big smile on her face. Her nipple hardened in the palm of my hand and her breathing quickened in my mouth. I got closer, and she pulled my face closer and her lips found my mouth, and then she kissed me. At least my heart seemed to be beating a little slower as she got closer. I kept sucking and she put her hands on my head, and pulled me towards her, my lips parting, and her tongue in my mouth. I kissed her as much as I could, and we started to French-kiss, our tongues intertwining each time, and her hands on my shoulders tightened.</p> <p>"Okay," she said, and pulled away.</p> <p>I sat back and watched her eyes roll up, and I felt like I was in a trance. She looked up at me.</p> <p>"You like," she said, smiling.</p> <p>She ran her hands over my shoulders and down at my chest, and I felt a small shiver go through me at her hands on my body. She brought her right hand over my left breast and gave it a playful squeeze. We looked at each other, and then she moved her face to mine. She kissed me with more passion, and I opened my lips and let it in, and felt her soft lips against mine. She pulled me closer, and I felt myself slipping a little down, and her tongue touched mine, and I moaned against her mouth. I pulled her away from me, and got off the couch. She looked at me with a big smile. I saw her eyes widen, and she looked so happy.</p> <p>She lay down on the couch, and I sat next to her. There wasn't much room, just a corner of the couch where it was nice to lie-down, and I pulled the sofa down, right next to where I put the cushions. Then I turned to her and kissed her for real, my hands on her breasts and feeling the flesh. It felt as if I had to touch something, and I moved my hand to her side and took a couple of steps. She still wore the skirt, so I went a little harder then, and her body jumped. I went to her feet and she put her arms around me and kissed me deeply.</p> <p>"Wow, this is fun," she said as she pulled my head closer to her, "and I haven't done it so soon." She ran her finger down my chest, and I saw her finger move over the waist band of my shorts and push it under and get down. I gasped as she slid them down, and her hand started doing the same thing on mine. I watched her hands, and felt her fingers come forward and get to my cock, and put an arm around her, and took her hand in mine. I kissed her lips very long, and she moved her hand and put it onto my cock.</p> <p>She didn't just caress me like I had before, she started to do that very slowly, even if she still had the skirt on.</p> <p>"Go ahead," she said.</p> <p>I felt her touch me all over, and she took long slow strokes, with her hands on mine and her body pressed back. I looked at her and she smiled, and then looked down at me.</p> <p>"What's the hurry?" she said.</p> <p>"Just a minute," Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
