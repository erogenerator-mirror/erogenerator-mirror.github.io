She giggled and grabbed my face. We kissed deeply before I started exploring her mouth with my tongue. Our tongues swirled together for several minutes until our lips met and I could feel her breathing quicken. She broke the kiss and pushed me hard into the wall.</p> <p>"How you doing, babe? I feel you getting harder, right?" She teased.</p> <p>"You have no idea. I still can't believe it when it's your face that I'm not just sucking, but kissing." I pulled away but was now in front of her, she took my hand and led it down and over her ass so I could feel it too. She wiggled it a little, which made me want to say it, but that wouldn't do.</p> <p>"Is that better?" She asked as she wrapped her fingers through my curls. I was more than happy to nod.</p> <p>"Good for you. Do you want me to call the girls and tell them that I'm sorry for being a bad girl?"</p> <p>"Nah, I'm not stupid. You better get out or there could be trouble." I heard her laugh and then heard some sort of giggling coming from the back of the house. We were both laughing a bit and at the same time she pulled me down and kissed me again. We broke the kiss and held each other. Neither of us wanted to part.</p> <p>"Come on in, the couch, we can sit down for awhile." She pulled me along and sat in the living room, we got on the couch and she sat astride my knee. She leaned in and kissed me. Her breasts rubbed up against mine as I held her and we continued kissing. I could feel myself getting hotter with every kiss and she moaned into my mouth, she grinded herself into me a little, I could feel her breasts against me. Our mouths were now locked in a passionate kiss as we reached a point in the kissing I had never felt with any other girl before. She broke the kiss and looked into my eyes and held my face in her hands. "I don't want to wait." She whispered. "I want to make you so fucking hard you won't be able to wait until morning."</p> <p>"No, it won't be that way, it'll just be the two of us." I said softly. She kissed me again.</p> <p>"Can we please take it as slow as we can," I said.</p> <p>"I guess we could just take as long as we want, but if we want it to last, you better be gentle." I kissed her again.</p> <p>I let her kiss me a minute then I pulled back and stood up, I took her hand and led her so that she was sitting on the couch. I pushed her dress up to her waist and began pulling off her shirt. She helped but was trying very hard to control herself. I undid her bra and reached around to unhook it but she stopped me.</p> <p>"Come on," she said before kissing me again. I stood up and removed her bra, her breasts were small, I don't know if that was because they were soft or what. I knelt in front of her and she pushed me back onto the couch so she could kneel between my legs. She looked up at me for a minute and smiled before looking down at me with those gorgeous blue eyes.</p> <p>"Are you ready to take my cherry?" She asked softly. "To make it special," I nodded and watched as my cock jumped at her words. Without a word she reached out and began gently stroking it as she had with her hands.</p> <p>"Will you take it from me?" I nodded and looked up at her, I didn't have to ask permission. She smiled up at me once more and nodded. Her hands reached up and I lifted her up slightly, then she began to lower her pussy down onto my member, I couldn't see anything and she began slow at first, I couldn't feel anything. Every few seconds she was going a little faster as I looked at her face. She gave out a quiet moan and her eyes grew wide, I could see that the look of pleasure I got from her was what she had been waiting for for. Her hands kept working up and down on my member and I could feel my cock throbbing each time she got close and stop. She leaned in and began sucking me again. I could feel the moisture and was surprised how well she could control herself by sucking cock. It was like we hadn't had sex in over a year, something we did a lot. She began moving faster, I could see her breasts bouncing and it drove me crazy. I leaned my head back and moaned.</p> <p>"I'm going to come!" I said to her.</p> <p>"Yes! Oh God yes!" She screamed, her handsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
