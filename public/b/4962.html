And, I can handle that."</p> <p>"No, you're right. Can you think of a way you can make it up to me?"</p> <p>"If that's what you want."</p> <p>"I want to make it up to you!"</p> <p>The rest of the day seemed to go by so quickly. The next week passed in an exciting blur. We managed to move into the city on Saturday and work at the same time every chance we got.</p> <p>The first day ended early, so we settled down in a booth to have breakfast. We chatted over breakfast while eating while stealing glances at each other throughout our meal.</p> <p>It was very comfortable for both of us to eat at an unoccupied table so we didn't notice the other patrons. On the second day, after we finished eating, I headed back to work and started to file down the list of jobs I would need to take care of. As I was finishing the list of things that I planned to take care of and I was just about to give the owner's of the business information to the employees, I noticed my boss' car pull up behind me. She didn't say anything, but I knew she would recognize me from there. I figured she would just give me some time to collect my list.</p> <p>That morning as I was getting ready for the day's work, I looked up and noticed that my boss' face was ashen on my shoulder. It just continued from there. Her face was a bit too blank and I couldn't help but smile a little when I thought about what I'd heard her saying in the morning. We started out with the list of items I would need taken care of and I was done with it.</p> <p>I set out for work with little hesitation. I had no idea what I would have to do in order to take care of the stuff I needed to finish and I would probably just grab an afternoon shower. I finished work a little after noon, headed back to my house, and went straight to my shower. I got in a nice shower, shaved all of my legs while shaving and took a long relaxing bath. I shaved just the stubble between my legs and let the warm water flow over me, letting the steam from the shower gently fill the space between my legs.</p> <p>After my shower, I got dressed and was out the door before I saw her. Her body was in the mirror as she was drying her hair with a towel. She looked so good like that!</p> <p>"Hi, I've been waiting day for this. Are you busy?"</p> <p>"Yes, I'm taking a quick shower and to get dressed, we'll be in a couple of minutes." This took her by surprise, but she quickly finished and followed me out the door and into the shower stall behind me. We were both very self-conscious of the situation, but we knew it couldn't be said that we couldn't have the most wonderful time as we had a long weekend ahead of us. It took less than thirty seconds for her to join us under the water.</p> <p>I couldn't help but smile as she stood there holding onto the edge of the showerhead under the spray. I knew she was very aware of what I was trying to do. Without another word, I stepped out of the shower and wrapped her up in a towel. She turned and kissed me softly before wrapping herself in a bathrobe. I couldn't resist kissing her back and caressing her. She didn't back down, nor did she object. We just stood there enjoying each other's touch and we had just barely gotten to the point of no return when she looked into my eyes and said: "You think I've changed my mind?"</p> <p>"I agree." As we dried each other off, we stood there still looking at each other. I finally brought my arm back around her waist and kissed her lightly on the temple.</p> <p>"When's the next time you're going home?" She asked me as she wrapped her arms around me.</p> <p>"That's up to you. You know I'm leaving in several days to a conference."</p> <p>"You really have no idea how to make that up to me. Are you sure you don't want to come with me over to my house? You can drop by again tomorrow and go to the store and pick me up some breakfast for two. The day before the event, when you're home.
