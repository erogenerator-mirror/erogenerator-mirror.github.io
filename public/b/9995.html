Just as she was coming he moved her so that only her head remained on the couch, and she wrapped her long legs around him. He kissed and nibbled her neck and shoulders, and she held him tight in her embrace as she shuddered and climaxed. With a final, contented shudder Suzie disengaged herself from him and stood up. She started dressing, and then looked at him smiling and blew him a kiss. He got up and looked at her, and she looked back. She knew of his love for her, and his need for her. There was much for that, but she needed it as well. She would get him back.</p> <p>She moved toward him, kissed him deeply, and caressed his cock. He groaned and she smiled.</p> <p>"What did you think of your little escapade?" she asked. "That was just incredible!"</p> <p>"Mmmm..."</p> <p>"So...I'll have to go see my mother tomorrow to collect all the money and buy you another present," Suzie said, with a devilish gleam in her eyes. "I'll even throw in my own gift, so to speak, and maybe you'll be so excited he'll buy it again."</p> <p>"Oh Suzie," he gasped. "That is something I never even imagined!"</p> <p>"What do you think he'll say if you tell him about that?" she asked with a wry smile.</p> <p>"Oh yes!"</p> <p>"Good. And I want you to give Mike that gift. If he's ever tempted again, just remember to mention it to me." "You mean like this, right now. Well, I don't have any better idea," he said. "What does that mean, Suzie?"</p> <p>He began to kiss her again, and she responded. She loved the feel of his strong cock touching her flesh, though, she cautioned herself, not to put it inside her, until she felt ready. That would be too soon. If she did that, he'd need time to recover. And it would be too quick after what had been.</p> <p>When they broke off the kiss she looked at him thoughtfully. "Can I take you home tonight, Mike? Would you like to stay for the night? I'll be sure to let someone in to see you before the dinner bell works its magic."</p> <p>"I'd like that...yes," he said. She gave him a pouty-face, and they broke off the kiss.</p> <p>"I'll let you sleep on me," Suzanne said, and with that she headed for the bedroom.</p> <p>As she got up and went into the bathroom Mike could have sworn he saw her putting on a little show for him. He knew what would happen if she started dancing for him, and it was what she was doing.</p> <p>When she returned he watched her, and he began to harden.</p> <p>"Well," she said with a giggle. "If you don't mind, I'd like to show you some of my tits for you."</p> <p>She pulled up her tee-shirt and showed her breasts to him, with his cock swelling to match her excitement. Then she pulled her shorts down and off, and stepped out of them.</p> <p>"Very nice" he said. You're a real find."</p> <p>"Thank you!" she said. Then she turned and faced him and put her arms around his neck. She pressed her breasts against him, and he could feel just how excited she was. When she reached down and began to rub her pussy up against it, he felt his stiff member poking her.</p> <p>"I hope you don't mind if I keep this private," he cautioned. "But I can't keep my hands off you."</p> <p>Suzie moved on top of him and put her mouth on his. Their mouths met and he caressed her breasts with his hands. She broke the kiss and moved down and began to suck her nipples. Her breasts were swollen and firm.</p> <p>She was breathing hard, and she began to move downward. She lifted her bottom off the couch, slid off his waistband, then straddled him. She reached between them and guided him into her. She began to impale herself on him, and he thrust upward to meet her. They were both gasping, and she was gasping with each inward thrust, and he was grunting as he drove into her.</p> <p>They locked eyes in time with each other, their mouths and tongues. He could feel himself beginning to cum, and then she began to ride him. She lifted herself off him and began to rub his cock against her clit, all the way in and all the way out.</p> <p>"Yesâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
