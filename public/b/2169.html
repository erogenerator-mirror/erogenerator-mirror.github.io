I asked. "Did the guys like it? Oh! Are you okay?"</p> <p>"Yeah, just great. Are you ready for more?"</p> <p>"Definitely," I replied. "It's the best part of that game."</p> <p>He chuckled and nodded. "Good."</p> <p>I went back up on top of our game, taking us places by the fire and setting up the shot. I was pleased at our success, and I was thrilled to see his expression change to a slight frown as I looked over my score.</p> <p>Sue was out shooting, and I saw her return quickly with what appeared to be the biggest smile I had ever seen.</p> <p>I had a good game, and I felt lucky to have had the advantage.</p> <p>Sue stopped her game a few guys went in to get a refill. She came back with the biggest grin I had ever seen on her, and then, she took my lead.</p> <p>I had the advantage, but I tried not to focus on my own game. As I saw the girls and Dave go back from shooting the game into their pussies, I felt a small sense of relief.</p> <p>Dave returned to his goal, and with Sue and I on the point, we stopped the shot. There was no need for us to move, we weren't stopping at the table.</p> <p>Sue and I laughed as we caught ourselves staring at Dave.</p> <p>Sue giggled back and said, "I was just wondering how good we'd end up scoring with the girls on the first round. There was always something in it."</p> <p>I tried not to think about what she thought or did.</p> <p>I felt Sue's hand in mine, and then mine at Dave's leg.</p> <p>Sue and I broke out laughing, and then I looked at Dave, and smiled. I couldn't believe he was seeing and hearing all this from someone I barely knew.</p> <p>Sue stood to one side of me, and leaned with her lips close enough that it was difficult to see. She was still smiling, but also a little uncertain and unsure of herself.</p> <p>She was a little taller than Sue, and she must have spent some time in an effort not to think it up. She had no problem with Dave taking our lead, but she also had difficulty in keeping my hopes in line.</p> <p>I looked and Dave's eyes widened a little, but he smiled and said, "They know you're not really paying attention. How was the game, Dave?"</p> <p>Sue laughed and said, "Yeah, it was pretty good, but the other team isn't so much of a team."</p> <p>"How was it?" Dave asked, and I felt Sue shaking in my arms.</p> <p>"It was hard to concentrate with the new team, but everyone could see we were starting to lose interest. Sue, you get the beer for us," Dave said, handing me a bottle, "I'll take the beer, and Dave, get the first round."</p> <p>I took a deep breath and then stood up, feeling somewhat self-conscious. Sue followed me, and Dave handed me a couple of beers with my name on the label.</p> <p>I looked around around the pool area, and there was a group of guys playing some game called "The Bull" that would usually take place in the women's locker room. I noticed one of the guys had a beer in his hand. I shook his hand briefly as I walked around the pool, but then I realized we had no shirts on.</p> <p>I turned my way toward the men's locker room, and then realized I hadn't gotten my shirt. If Sue had had a shirt, then what she had in her hand was on Dave's legs.</p> <p>Sue laughed in my arms, and I held her close. The thought crossed my mind that maybe Dave had had too much beer while we were having fun.</p> <p>Sue's hands were on my butt, squeezing and caressing.</p> <p>Sue said, "You're a lucky guy. You have some beer in your hand, and I need another one. What do you want to do?"</p> <p>I laughed, and said, "Let's get the ladies' shots and we can finish the game, OK?"</p> <p>Sue moved back and began to go to the pool counter, when she stopped suddenly. She turned toward me, a smile on her face, and said, "You really think Dave can handle it?"</p> <p>"Sue, I'm married. I know it sounds a little too much like cheating," I replied, almost defensively but with a smile.</p> <p>Sue walked toward the changing area, and paused at the doorway.</p> <p>Sue looked me in the eyesâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
