You're such a prude!"</p> <p>"I'm a free spirit. I don't ever need much. Some of the free spirit's the ones who came to see me. In fact, as a free spirit, they may be very good judges of what's available to you. That's how one of the good ones come to see you. Most of the free spirit's here come with money or work or charity.</p> <p>"You like people who are free, are just waiting for a friend, and you're not likely to meet any of them you know. They'll be a shock to you right away since you need to have someone else to meet with."</p> <p>"You're right!" I said, "If there's a free spirit here, I'll be more than happy to call. I just need some extra money for some things that we don't have money for."</p> <p>"Well, the money isn't enough right now, is it?" Tasha laughed at the memory of my past. "Now, I think there's something for us to do. Let's go and clean up."</p> <p>I went into the bathroom and cleaned up as much as I could. That was a lot to wash myself with the soap I had used earlier and it had got all over my shirt before long so I had to wash it dry. I'd been pretty clean before I started washing my hair, so drying myself didn't take long at all. As I stepped out of the bathroom and dried myself, I looked up at myself in the mirror. I looked very lovely.</p> <p>I smiled. When I first met Tasha, I had been a very shy individual and was just afraid to do anything that would embarrass her, especially if she knew what I was doing. When I finally got over my hesitancy and actually dated her, I felt very safe in her company, even though I was probably probably far too inexperienced in the ways of the world to be attracted to someone of my sexuality. After all, we were just the friendly couple who had been living together for about eight months when she took me in my bed as I was cleaning up the kitchen in one of her big bathrobes. I'm no prude myself. I knew that she had one of the nicest, nicest bodies I'd ever had the pleasure of touching, even though I would never admit that to her. Just as long as she wasn't going to freak out or run away from me in some way, I was fine with that. If Tasha and I were going to be exclusive or exclusive, then we should have a rule that we never take any initiative, especially not that she or I had a choice.</p> <p>I felt the need to be careful that she wasn't really mad at me for breaking our rule, as long as it didn't actually hurt her feelings to be the one to break the rule. If I didn't do anything that the other person didn't think was right for us to do, then I should be the one to try to be the one to break that rule. After all, I had only taken a few drinks to warm up, and I could have made a lot more of a fool of myself than I had done. I felt like a complete idiot.</p> <p>After the bathroom was clean, I headed back inside and Tasha was sitting in front of the TV with her eyes closed and a contented sigh, while her arms were resting on the arm of the chair with her hands folded in front of her, her feet planted on the floor. I saw her eyes open briefly.</p> <p>"Good for you," I mumbled. "It looks like we've got an interesting first date."</p> <p>I felt a bit embarrassed for the first time since that first date began. It reminded me of the way I had felt. I had done what I was doing, and it felt good.</p> <p>Tasha leaned towards me.</p> <p>"How was your date?" she asked in a way that told me that I'd finally started being sincere when I replied, "I hope to make up for the amount of time we've spent with you here."</p> <p>"I was glad to meet you," I said, feeling like a school girl.</p> <p>She gave me a light kiss on the cheek.</p> <p>"So, you and I were a bit apart until this past weekend," she said. "I thought I'd take advantage of it."</p> <p>I had expected something quite different. Tasha was still sitting in front of the TV, but her arms weren't still on the arm of the chair but were now folded on the cushions, and her head was tilted back and she was looking at the ceiling.</p> <p>"Tasha, what did you think of our first time?" I was still not sure that I was being honest with Tasha so I told her that it was very nice and that I'd had aâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
