It's a beautiful day by the look of it. Perfect for shooting. "Come here" you say</p> <p>Moving to your chair, you give me a hug and kiss. "So...this is your first day as a camper?" you say.</p> <p>"Yeah, and I was thinking the same thing." I say</p> <p>"Would you like to go again later tonight?" I ask. Before you can answer, I ask once again.</p> <p>"Yes, I would like to." As the words left your mouth, you took a breath. "And, again I would like to enjoy the experience of being a camper again."</p> <p>I give you a kiss. "So am I going back up to your place then?"</p> <p>"No, I'm going to stay with you until after dinner.</p> <p>We are kissing, your face turning a bright red as you start to pull away. I notice your eyes are red.</p> <p>You grab my face and kiss me hard. My tongue is in your mouth. At this point, I am on fire.</p> <p>I slowly put my hand on your cheek and let it go. "You are too beautiful and you're all I think about at night, even if I want to be mad at you. I guess I just wanted to get to know you a little more and hopefully start getting to know you." I say.</p> <p>"Why thank you very much," you say. You take the camera and put it to the side of the table we are at. We sit there for a little while. "So I was about to ask you about you and your camper?" you ask.</p> <p>Taking the opportunity to ask questions, I do. "Yeah, you're my first camper and I thought if I spent enough time with you, I would probably be able to have things that I love with both of us, don't you agree, that sounds good"</p> <p>"It feels good to get the camera in hand again before my other first time." you say as you look up at the camera. "I just want to get started."</p> <p>The evening is just getting started and I am still wondering what happened after that, when you have your bath. "You're not allowed to wash yourself, right? We're going to have to take your dress off right away, you don't like that do you? I don't like to have to take my clothes off and you have to watch."</p> <p>"N-no, I don't mind." you say as you start to get out the dress. You put down the dress in which you don't always wear any hose and get on your bed. Before you turn around and walk away, you drop the dress on the floor. You look at me and say. I can only guess. "How long did you think that you might need to wait before coming back to the camper?" I ask.</p> <p>"Oh, just about 20 minutes, why?" you say.</p> <p>"Ahhh....that wasn't the point, was it? I'm going to take the dress off soon enough." I say.</p> <p>"It's only 2 sheets, and I'm not going to be too long until the bed is out here."</p> <p>Knowing the chances are good, I get up and get off to bed, throwing on shorts and a t-shirt off. By this time, I'm tired and do not have much time to do myself. I go back into the camper, put back on my shorts and t-shirt and head down to get my laptop from the couch. I go into the living room and start to get my laptop out. As I start working, I can see the clock on my laptop. It is 8AM and before a single time, I wake up with the laptop on with an empty laptop. I get a chair from the kitchen and set it up in there and throw in on the stereo. As I sit in the chair, I sit there and am thinking of how I had last night. I can't believe it but it had been something I truly enjoyed. It turned me on. I wanted to take things slow and to relive how I loved it. The day has been the same, the only difference is that now I can experience the same kind of feelings of desire that I have enjoyed the last. I wish this could last the rest of it.</p> <p>In my mind, I'm thinking about how I wanted to be with you, kissing you and touching you and being with you.</p> <p>That's what my wife said. After that, there was nothing I wasn't willing to do or do for her or I would have done it myself. This might just be one of those times that neither one of us would ever get into. We will have to wait and seeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
