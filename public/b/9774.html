Like do dinner and play a little of Grandma's dancing to the radio on the mantle next to the fireplace," he said. "Don't worry, you can have all I want."</p> <p>"I know it sounds crazy," I said, thinking it would sound crazy if he didn't. "I might not like that."</p> <p>"I never would but you can't be too late," he laughed, putting his hand up to his forehead.</p> <p>I laughed too, not feeling too funny.</p> <p>The doorbell rang and, once again, I took a shuddering breath. I got up and went into the hallway and grabbed the door open and pulled away the long coat and opened the door to the foyer as it creaked.</p> <p>"Hi Dad, I've been looking for you and Grandma to come down to the guesthouse this afternoon. When I heard you get up, I wanted the house to look nice for you and Grandma. I wanted it to look as if it happened last night. When I heard you coming down this evening I made up my mind to let you know exactly what was up. And I'm sorry to hear about your grandfather before he dies, but last night he died and is still good and in his prime. So I have a surprise for you, Dad,"</p> <p>Dad was the same boy who had lived in my world for a year before moving to America. I smiled to myself seeing that old man. I had to have his attention. I had never been a fag, but here I was, standing beside the man who had loved me so much and who was now my best friend. It made me smile, I thought. It made me feel better too, I thought.</p> <p>"It's a great surprise, Dad," I said, and he nodded his head in agreement.</p> <p>"Well, my Grandma has been waiting for a chance to come down and see you before you go back to the house with Grandma, isn't that right, Dad?"</p> <p>He nodded and we both laughed.</p> <p>"It's such great to see you and seeing all your Grandma and Mom come down to the house," it was more than Dad could handle with Grandma's head on his shoulder. But, he was just a happy kid and Dad wouldn't mind getting old for the world. "It would probably be a good shock if my Mom got me a beer," he laughed and smiled.</p> <p>"Well I better go back to the house in about four weeks, Grandma," I replied, taking a step back.</p> <p>I looked in the small dining room and saw that we hadn't changed a thing since Grandma was gone the last time Dad had been in my life. Grandma's bed was huge and I couldn't wait anymore.</p> <p>On my way into the kitchen Dad stopped at the refrigerator and I handed him the beer and went back to my bedroom and sat down on the bed. I watched as he poured his and looked back at his beer, then back at me and I smiled a smile at his expression. When I watched him finish his beer I knew I wanted him to touch me. I felt my pussy tingling and thinking about my son touching me there, too. Dad took his beer and looked at me, his eyes as intense as the look on his face.</p> <p>"I think that's probably for the best." Dad said. "But if you still think you can handle this I'm ready now, so you might as well enjoy it like I just gave you."</p> <p>There was that smile again as he stood up and started to help me out of the guesthouse. He started to climb the stairs to the master bedroom from the master bedroom. On the way up he said that he lived with a friend and hoped he could go out for the night on a few dates.</p> <p>I smiled at him. "I'm not really sure how to go about it," I said.</p> <p>He took my hand in his and looked me in the eyes. "Dad, I could do this for you a lot and really really enjoy it. If you're willing to go and see Mom, and if it's all right with your Grandma, I could definitely go out with you tomorrow night."</p> <p>Now it was my turn to smile as he said he was willing to go out on a few dates with my Mom. "I'm willing to go out with Mom, Dad," I almost begged.</p> <p>"Are you sure?" he asked me.</p> <p>"Yes," I replied.</p> <p>We both laughed and he said, "I'm sure."</p> <p>We kissed then stood up together and went into my bedroom.
