The house could use a good coat of paint and polish and a good paint job." She smiled at herself in the mirror. "I might just do the same tomorrow when he gets here." She took her brush again and started to coat her brush before adding a nice thick coat of lipstick. She applied the coat of lipstick on her lips, a little rouge to her eyelashes, her eyelashes and along her full lips. She looked down, noting how her lipstick had disappeared from view.</p> <p>"I know its a little on the tight side, but at the moment I don't think it's too bad." She applied the glossy lipstick. "You've never had lipstick on you before?"</p> <p>"No, not in the car, I haven't." She chuckled a little remembering the night. It had been a very long time since she and her husband stopped having sex, after it all felt very good. A few weeks later they had both been out partying, after the kids had gone to bed. He had come down to bed with her, as she usually had done after they were having sex, and had laid down on the sofa. He had then turned her over onto her back, where she had spread her legs, taking her panties with them. She then had slid them down along with her skirt and, before it had gone up to the point of crossing, had spread her thighs open, as he had done to her then, and they were now both exposed and open to her. She had looked up, taking in his face, as she had seen his erection; she had run her hand over his erection, feeling it harden and push out from his body.</p> <p>And he had taken her panties as part of her clothes.</p> <p>Her mind had been on his cock, and the fact that it was still fully inserted in her. She had then slid the panties up and off her legs, and then had run her fingers along the length and firmness of him. She had not really had sex with her husband since she and her husband had married, and it had been a while. She remembered a few years ago. She had watched her husband masturbate. She had thought about him doing the same thing, and masturbated herself. There had been no sex, it was all a fantasy. She had masturbated and now she was thinking about her husband doing it. She had been turned on and was feeling her wetness increase as she thought about it. She started taking off her blouse. She had removed her bra and threw it to him.</p> <p>As she stood on her toes to reach the top, she slowly turned the chair around and looked at herself. She had done a lot of thinking now, thinking about the events of the evening, and about how the evening had gone. She wanted to tell her husband about it. But she couldn't. She was just going back to the past, trying to remember her past. She had always enjoyed being with people, and enjoyed the pleasures of sex, but not in the same way. Sex was new, exciting, erotic, but she knew that this would probably never happen again. And he would never know she enjoyed it, that she had just experienced it sexually. She had been so very young, and he would never know, nor would he ever suspect.</p> <p>She sat down in the chair and looked at herself in the mirror. Her mind had been so focused on her husband, trying to convince him, she had never felt sexual pleasure. It had never felt right, it felt wrong. It had always made her feel ashamed that her husband got aroused at all that the sight of her, her breasts looked in her little pink nightie. It had not mattered that they were just a little peep show, because it had never mattered at all. Or was it, because he enjoyed looking up her nightdress anyway? It had never really bothered her. Until, now. And then it had to change, she thought.</p> <p>She leaned back against the chair and ran her hand over her body. She had longed for a more masculine feeling, with a man, she told herself. And she had been such a horny slut, looking at herself in the mirror. She could not bear to let herself think about any way that it might happen again. It had always been a fantasy, but she just couldn't go back to that level anymore.</p> <p>She got up and headed into the bathroom to clean up. She had to go into the living room with her husband. She wanted him to know what had happened tonight, and to feel at all that she could be happy in being with him. She had never thought she would feel such good feeling again. She smiled.</p> <p>She had heard some voices at the table. She smiled wider, looking around for the guy in the house next to the wall.
