She saw the look her face gave him. Then he saw her eyes. She nodded. He knew she was thinking the same thing about him. She was in awe of the situation. "I know how beautiful we look each others. I know that much."</p> <p>They lay in each other arms. Her fingers traced his face and cheek while her hand held onto his thigh. She rested her head on his shoulder and they spent the afternoon and evening making love.</p> <p>***</p> <p>He woke up to her lips on his. She looked into his eyes and told him it was time to go to work. He had a new look on too. He thought of some of the things she told him. She told him he didn't have to have sex with other people. She said he wouldn't have had sex with other women, he could still date her. Her husband would never approve. To him, she had done it out of respect. He agreed, knowing she loved him.</p> <p>He wondered what made her feel the same. He was confused. Maybe it was because it was all new for her. He didn't know for sure, but he knew that whatever it was, she wanted to please him. He didn't know what to expect from today.</p> <p>"I know that you feel differently toward me than you do with your wife. You will feel that same way with us. You may feel confused or embarrassed or both. I'm sorry but this will be our little secret. I will never touch you without your permission."</p> <p>He held her tightly. He loved her dearly. He knew that it would make no difference if she were with his wife. He would always tell her. She felt it with him. She would always trust him, even when she felt he may be a threat.</p> <p>"I need to stop thinking of you that way. You're all that I think about, so I can't control what we have."</p> <p>"You can talk to me about anything else. We can work on getting this stuff finished. We have the next two weeks. Okay?"</p> <p>He gave her a deep kiss, enjoying her full body when it came. As always, she didn't try to hide anything from him. He loved it when she kept to herself. They did love each other. It was just a physical connection between them because they loved each other.</p> <p>"How about Saturday? We can go. I'll meet you there."</p> <p>She smiled and kissed his mouth. "What are we going to do?"</p> <p>To be continuedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
