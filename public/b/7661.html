"Don't you feel good, big bad boy? It feels so good to have my little pussy stuffed full of that big black cock."</p> <p>"I don't know baby, it isn't right, I'll tell you when and if it happens, if it ever does. But right now, it feels just great!"</p> <p>I had never been happier in my entire life, and her tone and excitement made all the difference. I never doubted the answer that would come to me when I eventually fucked her. Or, on top of that, when the time came. I never doubted her offer, but here you are in my bed, getting ready to fuck the next woman that you want to fuck.</p> <p>"That's why I was so quiet the other night," she continued, still rocking gently against me, "while you were fucking my cunt. I was hoping you were going to pull out before you filled me with a good load and leave, so I could get you to fuck me again sometime."</p> <p>"Oh God, I do love you," I groaned.</p> <p>"And you are definitely going make it with the next woman. I was hoping you would. If you could help me, I'd give you my virginity too."</p> <p>I groaned as her words rolled over me. I pulled her back onto my cock, and we rocked together as I shot my load in her tight pussy. It was wonderful, and I just knew I was going to make it with the next woman. We both groaned and ground against one another, until the after-effects of our passion subsided, and we lay there for several long minutes, panting into each other's faces.</p> <p>"Let me get my panties, please," she whispered. When she was dressed, she gave me a peck on the lips before she turned back to work on the kitchen's breakfast.</p> <p>"Hurry it up, we have all day to make breakfast, and it'll be ready in just ten," she directed. "I think we got around to that," I heard. It always turned me on that she cooked all day, and she knew it. The next stop was to finish a second piece of the pie. While making my breakfast, I watched as she removed her clothes, and when she put on a robe, it was obvious she was going to fuck him again.</p> <p>She did, I could tell when she sat down at the table and began serving him, and I didn't care if it was a quick hand-job. I had wanted that last bit of fun. So much the better for her. She made his coffee and sat down beside him, smiling as she pulled the sheet over him. She reached under the sheet and gave his flaccid cock a slow stroke.</p> <p>"How does all that stuff feel, son? Did you ever fill me up with your big black come before?"</p> <p>She watched him and smiled as she rubbed her hand over his semi-hard dick. "This is how you fill my pussy. My cunt is just your cum. That way it makes my pussy nice and slick for any cock that cums in me."</p> <p>"My turn," he said, "now you can clean up my mess so you can do the same for me." I couldn't believe what I had just done, and I smiled sheepishly. It was more than I could say.</p> <p>"Now, go make a salad for breakfast, and bring me your lunch at home," she directed. After we had finished our eggs and bacon, I set the table and we sat down at the table, and ate. Then I set the table again and we sat there, and talked for the next forty-eight hours. She didn't tell me what had happened that morning, which was probably a good thing; I could have told her how much I enjoyed the time I had spent with her and her kids, or how she wanted to see me again.</p> <p>"Well, that's one big difference we made that we make now," I said. "As for that lunch I did have something else to do."</p> <p>"I heard you went out," she teased. "Let me guess, you came home early to pick up a pizza? I hope it's okay, I'm hungry! And as much as I do hate to do it right here, I just don't think it's going to kill me to have you suck my pussy off and you do your own!"</p> <p>I laughed and got up to refill her coffee mug. I sat close to her side and put my arms around her and pulled her to me. "No, you will have to wait. Let's go upstairs and make it a quickie and do it again, and then we'll find a place to eat. We can eat again as soon as we get homeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
