I have just never found women attractive in the same way as she was in this situation. I have always told myself that sex with other men is dirty and dirty, and so it's the truth. That in my experience no other man has made me feel this sexy or aroused. I have heard from other women who had made it more than a simple fantasy and felt a pang of guilt in that feeling. But I would be lying if I said that I was not turned on by my own woman getting my cock played with by an old man. I could feel the lust in her eyes as her hands caressed my shaft and her legs moved up so that she could wrap them around my lower back. I felt her breasts press against my chest and the weight of them felt good. Her voice was soft, she had a husky quality that appealed to me very well.</p> <p>Our conversation was mostly about her life and the kids. Her husband was a doctor and his only child was out of town and that he was not what she was thinking about. She would tell me all about her life, including her own divorce. When I got a little hard I had to put my head down to hide my erection. But she didn't seem to mind, and she didn't even let me come up for air. What was she thinking?</p> <p>We continued our conversation by the time that I knew we really were at the end of our talk. She seemed to be a little nervous, almost afraid. I thought she was going to try and kiss me or run away at either the point that I came. However she didn't, she simply got up off the seat and came around to my side and kissed me on the cheek. I was in no mood to be a jerk because she was such a lovely woman, and I didn't want a second date, nor did I want to date her again. My dick was still in a little droop so it was only natural that I put my hand on one of those small breasts and felt the firmness in the way I had always found so fascinating. I think she liked the feeling, too. After a few moments she seemed to get over her embarrassment at being kissed. Her tongue gently brushed my head and her fingers lightly brushed the side of my face as she did, her eyes were still closed, but her hand was now under my chin and I could feel it softly caressing my upper lip. The way her fingers felt against mine made my heart leap. My cock was still hard and she felt it.</p> <p>She led me by the hand to the room where a couch was and lay me down on my back with her over me. Her legs were straddling mine, and her dress was hiked up to her waist. Then she took a shoe and began to roll and play with them slowly. When she slid her panties to the side I could see my cock spring out to greet her. The feel of them against her body made me think of all of the things I wanted to do to her; the way I wanted to fuck her; the feel of the smooth skin along her inner thighs; and the taste of her. She kissed me again while she sat on my thighs, then got up onto her knees so that I could reach her breasts. I couldn't believe that this had turned out like this; I was in a strange position with her sitting on me, not to mention my wife and family, and I felt so much like I was just another man to her. She stroked my chest and kissed it softly.</p> <p>I could feel her warm face next to mine, and it wasn't just the feeling of being so close; it was the warm feeling we gave each other. She started at my ear and kissed the shell of it with her tongue and I was soon turned on and hot again by her kissing and touching me. This young woman, in her late 40s, was not the type to be afraid. This young lady wanted me and I didn't mind. I lay back and relished the feeling of her hands on me and the feeling of her tongue dancing around my earlobe. Her lips were moving against mine and I heard the same gentle purring sound that I was going to be sure found in the rest of her mouth. She had such tenderness about her that it was beyond belief. She moved to my ear, her tongue snaked out to the hole and slid it inside as she kissed me. I started to feel like she was licking through a wet and warm tunnel and it didn't sound like she was trying to reach for what she wanted so she could come to me. But her tongue in and out of my ear made me think of what was going on in her eyes when they closed. It made me want to kiss her all over again, as well as makeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
