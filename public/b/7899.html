Just as she would want to kiss him right then and there, she lowered herself down the length of him and kissed him softly. Then kissed him again, more firmly this time. She could feel her body tingle as he pressed into her.</p> <p>She felt his hands on her hips as he slowly pulled her against him, and she could feel him growing more excited with the feel of her naked body pressed against him. He began to rock against her and she could feel herself becoming very wet as her sex slowly engulfed him.</p> <p>As he slid into her, he felt the softness of hair on his pubic mound, and it felt so wonderful. He moved slowly, pushing himself deeper into her, his hips moving out of self control and he began to rock himself in and out, feeling her body quiver as he worked himself into her, feeling how she moved with him.</p> <p>His hands were now on her hips. He had moved them around some more, pushing her down with his body to give each of them more stimulation, and to help her to feel him inside her with their own wet, hot body. His hips thrust harder against her, then faster, deeper, then softer, feeling what he felt.</p> <p>At first, he felt her moving against him to increase the pleasure. Then he felt her body tensing and he could feel her body moving in a motion he knew well. He began moving his hips faster and deeper into her as she moved with him.</p> <p>His hands moved from her hips and he began to work himself into the tight sheath of her body, feeling every hard thrust inside of her as his body pushed forward with her hips.</p> <p>He could feel it building, feeling it, he could feel it rising inside of her, wanting and needing. She moved faster on him, almost pushing him into her faster. He thrust even harder and deeper into her, feeling himself as her body moved out of control, as she came.</p> <p>He heard her moan, and felt himself, so deep, as her pussy grabbed the length of him as she came. Then he felt his stomach move to a different feeling as he moved harder and faster than she could. He didn't know how long they had been going, but he couldn't last.</p> <p>She had stopped moving on him, suddenly, and he felt her pussy tightening and loosening around him, squeezing him. He knew she could feel him getting close and that he had to move as well.</p> <p>Suddenly he felt her body quiver again and she cried out "Yes, oh yes, so go on, I'm cuming, god yes, Oh my god yes, I'm cuming...!" he didn't know when had finished, but it had happened, and he was in perfect heaven, his own body on fire, and his hands and feet trembling.</p> <p>He thought he heard hissing as his body shook and his muscles tensed and his body jerked and jerked. Her voice was low and she said "oh my god, oh my god. That was so fucking goooood." and he saw her pussy clench around him and her body move to the next climax, and he felt both the incredible rush and then release and then her body slowly started to relax.</p> <p>As she felt him start to soften inside of her, she whispered to him "Wow, you are one sweet guy, no regrets." and he heard her talking to herself as he drifted off to sleep.</p> <p>He never told her how the story had been all that had aroused him with what she had done. She had felt it too, and she had felt like he was the only one for her.</p> <p>He slept like that that night, in his bedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
