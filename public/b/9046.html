I have been here for eight years and, even though I've tried this several times, my personal opinion can be a bit bias. This is the first time I really felt like someone was in charge, let me tell you.</p> <p>When we finished our dinner, we cleared the table and started going for more of the wine. The conversation had shifted from business to personal, the wine was a good beginning for what was obviously a good time. A lot of the conversations were very personal, about what I've done, what I'm supposed to do, and generally how I feel. I guess things like that could get pretty personal at times when you're trying to be sociable but not getting the hang of things like that. It felt pretty nice, to be honest but I was still a little tentative about telling you all that. I guess I was curious enough to ask her questions about being gay. I guess I didn't even know what to imagine what I'd ask her next.</p> <p>"What is your name?" She asked.</p> <p>"Brock," I replied. "A buddy of mine. He's been with a couple but my only experience was with women for a few years now, it feels a bit much for me."</p> <p>"Maybe you should try it, it's nice to meet a woman that you can talk to about your personal things," she said, sounding like she was offering me a way out of my uncertainty.</p> <p>"I don't know about that. I was expecting someone very like you, you certainly have a way to get a little experience out of something," I replied.</p> <p>After another sip of wine, she smiled and added, "I'm glad you're comfortable and open about that stuff. I'm glad."</p> <p>"I am." I said with a slight smile on my face. "It's nice to meet a woman that you can talk to about what you do."</p> <p>"Well... I wasn't sure about your last question. How old are you?"</p> <p>I honestly wasn't sure what I was going to ask her, but my curiosity was having the expected effect. "I'm nineteen."</p> <p>"That's really nice," she said, giving me a smile. She raised her glass and we started talking. The glasses were getting quite a bit more crowded and it took a while to get to the point. After our glass of champagne had been empty, one of the topics of conversation changed, it was going to get a bit personal.</p> <p>We were standing by the fireplace talking about the weather and she asked if I was going to come to her house for a beer and dinner. I was kind of surprised that she would invite me to her home, but I agreed. I had a really good feeling about how things were going between us and I had a feeling that life had gotten a lot, if not better.</p> <p>We drank a little more beer and we were sitting around the table talking and enjoying the evening with our drinks when she asked if I was a fan of my dad's baseball team anymore. I replied to that by referring to it in general terms as the men's and women's teams. "That's probably a good way of putting it," I noted, giving her a meaningful look.</p> <p>"I didn't know that, but I guess one of the reasons we were talking about it was because the big things are always up for discussion," she explained. I'm not sure exactly what she was talking about, but I could tell that she was serious, like she was trying to get me to hear her point of view. A lot of the things that happened that night was hard to gauge what her view were, I couldn't really do much with one person but I made an effort to make it a point of the conversation.</p> <p>I guess if I got past how close we got, I could have found other thoughts to be going through my mind as well. My dad had his wife pregnant now and that could just stay that way. If I could get past what the rest of the night had in common, then I would have felt closer to her. The thing that really surprised me was how much I was actually considering whether or not I felt like I had a chance with her or not. We had been friends for a couple of years and had talked almost every single thing in one conversation since our separation, from my college studies to my mom being pregnant.</p> <p>As we finished our second round of the evening, we decided to get another bottle of wine for more wine, this time from our bottle, which was good enough. We were having too much fun to even finish that bottle. By the time dinner time was over and we had consumed all the alcohol to the point we were sipping wine pretty cheap, we were both pretty buzzâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
