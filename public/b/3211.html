Her mouth covered the head and she sucked and let him slide out of her mouth. Then she leaned forward and began to lick the shaft clean of every last drop.</p> <p>"So, Ms. White," he said. "Was this ok with you?"</p> <p>"Yes," she replied. "I had a really good time, too, I hope you're not mad at me?" She looked down at his softening cock.</p> <p>"Not at all. I think it was great, and yes, you should consider it, too, don't you?" He smiled. "But you must know, I feel really awkward. I mean, the thought that you might actually like it was something I didn't want to do, and I'm not sure I'd have survived it if you were there."</p> <p>"I'll take that as a compliment," she said. "I know it wasn't as bad as I thought it was." She smiled at the memory as her tongue slid along his shaft and then back to his balls.</p> <p>Once again, he was sitting on the bed where he belonged, and she smiled as she took another swig from the bottle of champagne. She got up and leaned over him, her full breasts hanging above his face, her hard nipples pressing against his lips as she lifted them and rubbed them against him. He quickly kissed and sucked each nipple, and then she lowered her body down and began to suck in his balls. "Oh, Ms. White," he moaned as her face came forward and she took them into her mouth. "That feels so good." He moved his hips toward her mouth, and she raised her face slightly so he could slip his aching cock into her mouth again. Her tongue slowly licked him again and as it touched his cock she felt his head become hypersensitive. He moaned again. "Oh, Ms. White, that feels fantastic."</p> <p>"Mmmmm," she moaned. "My body is your cock, my pleasure." She began to suck and lick him like it was a fine piece of chocolate. As he began to groan, she pushed him up on his back and straddled his hips. His cock slipped into her pussy as she slowly slid up and down his shaft.</p> <p>"Oh, Ms. White, I want to fuck you so much," he groaned.</p> <p>"Yes," she agreed. The moment he moved her hips, she impaled her body on his. For several minutes, he moved and she moved, in and out of her pussy. When he couldn't hold on any longer, he began rocking his hips and fucking her at the same time, as her hips met his every stroke. She began to climax faster than he did, and he felt her pussy squeeze his cock in ecstasy, milking every last drop of him.</p> <p>"Oh, Ms. White!" He said as he looked up into her eyes. "That was terrific!"</p> <p>"Yes," she agreed. "I'm glad it was. I really needed that." The way he had looked so longingly after his release, she felt a flush of pleasure. She thought she knew where she and Sam had been going. She was beginning to feel the beginnings of a craving for sex with the person before her. She wasn't going to ask him to come on to her again. She just wanted to keep it just like all this time.</p> <p>Just before they both fell asleep in each other's arms, he said, "I'm going to go into town and see if I can stay the night, and then I’ll have to drive home." "No problem," he said. "That's fine." He kissed her on the lips and was gone.</p> <p>When Sam came in, he was feeling a little guilty because now that he was going to have some alone time with the woman he loved, he didn't feel like he wanted to rush off. As he walked into the bedroom, he saw her lying on her back with her face turned to the side of the bed, and her eyes were closed, just enjoying her morning. "Are you back yet?" he asked.</p> <p>"Nope," she replied. "I had a wonderful time. And while you left, that was nice. It had been a wonderful, if slightly lonely, experience for me. I hope I can do the same again." Sam smiled warmly.</p> <p>"Not to mention nice," he grinned. "You seemed to enjoy the rest of our little lovemaking session."</p> <p>"Oh, yes," she said. "It was great! But there's no way I'll be able to get all of my things until tomorrow morning." Of course, that would be too late to clean and get dressed properly.
