They kissed, they caressed, they fondled, they caressed, they fondled but only to the point where he was so caught up in their ministrations that he wouldn't have cared about what they were doing. After all, had he really enjoyed the first time he saw them naked...</p> <p>*</p> <p>Chapter 5: A New Beginning</p> <p>Marge had been in her office a lot after work, as had John. She was also busy working on her story and found that he was spending a lot of time behind her.</p> <p>She was wearing that same blue skirt again, this time as well as the thigh, and a green sweater that was so soft, so thin and so very pretty. She wasn't wearing panties, of course, as she usually was these days, and the way he looked at her made her so very want to rub up against him.</p> <p>The sweater wasn't very long, just long enough just to hide her charms, but it couldn't hide what he usually liked to see. Just the idea of his eyes looking at her naked body was arousing. She was so horny. As he took his eyes off her, she turned around, bent over, and picked up the story he was supposed to be reading. She turned around again, then began to run her hands all over her body. She wanted to feel him so bad. It had been so long since he had touched her before with just his eyes. There was no pretending anymore. They wanted each other. They wanted to be fucked by each other. They were both naked. His hands were exploring as much of her body as they could reach, touching the lines and places he knew she especially liked to be touched. As for herself, she felt so alive that she didn't care. She couldn't think anymore.</p> <p>They were both feeling flushed and excited and so excited to be together again that all she could think about was how they made love. How they made love.</p> <p>She wasn't sure what to say. Was she having feelings for this new guy, or what? She didn't care. She just wanted to feel him inside her. She didn't want to see him in his clothes. She didn't want to see him doing things to himself, touching himself, or just looking at his own body. And she did want to be near him...</p> <p>She didn't know exactly how to say it. Was this what they meant to each other? And she didn't know exactly what to say. What if she liked it, or disliked it? What if she had a fantasy? Then they were both at the very same end of the spectrum. They were both doing exactly the same thing and it wasn't really a fantasy at all. It wasn't really a fantasy.</p> <p>She didn't know what to say. She didn't know where to look, how to begin. What to do? How to make a start? She wanted to tell him so bad that she almost wanted to die. She didn't want him to stop just to be close to her, and to make love. She wanted all of this to be so real and real that neither did anything to spoil it.</p> <p>She looked at his face. He had just started reading. She saw his eyes. The way his hands were wandering to her body, touching her breasts and down her stomach and over her crotch, down to the top of her legs and up over her hips.</p> <p>She wanted him to stop there. She wanted him to stop touching her just to make a start. She wanted him to touch her just to make a start. She thought about the two people in front of her on the bed doing things they hadn't even considered doing in a long time. It was so wrong.</p> <p>For the second time in the past two weeks, Marge wanted to do that to herself, to be closer to John. She was still thinking about their previous meeting, with his erection as proof, her. She wanted to do it just as he had done.</p> <p>She took a sip of tea and took care about all that. She had to think now of how she wanted to get to John. She wanted him to come inside her.</p> <p>But it could never happen. Not with him anyway, of course, but with his beautiful fiancée. And then there were other things. She realized there was nothing left for her. The man she knew wouldn't stop what was happening. She didn't love him anymore. She couldn't just let him go.</p> <p>She shook her head slowly. That wasn't fair. He wasn't even doing anything with her anymore. She wanted him to take care of her first!</p> <p>Chapter 6: The Truth, The Truth, and Part 2</p> <p>Marge had no problem getting up in the morning, in fact she—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
