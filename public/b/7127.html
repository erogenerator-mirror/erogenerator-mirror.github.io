"Can we have lunch now? Please get here now," she said again.</p> <p>"I want to go too," I said. "When we are done though. I would love to come up to your apartment. I'm going to do the dishes and you know where to put the hot food. You just wait in the kitchen. You get my cell number and I will call and ask you to come by that day," I said. "It will be in the morning," I said, "just in case."</p> <p>"Okay, Mr. M," she said in that big smile again. I turned and walked back to my office wondering how I got the nickname, wondering why I hated it. I had a good plan for tomorrow. The only reason I knew I didn't want to tell her what I was thinking about was because I would be fucking her next. Oh god, oh god, I need the bitch, what can I say, I was just scared.</p> <p>Aunt Sally returned that day with a big surprise. I was sitting in the reception when she knocked. I was in the office all day doing paperwork. Aunt Sally said, "It's good to see you again," then went to check the reception. She found me already waiting by the door with a plate. "I like to be here, Mr. M," she said.</p> <p>"Are you ready for lunch?"</p> <p>"Sure," she replied.</p> <p>"What's in store for you today? I'm glad you are going to be my secretary today, so you can work with me." Aunt Sally gave me a big smile and said, "I'm the boss. That makes me the best secretary in the world, you know."</p> <p>"I like that job," I said, and it hit me as well.</p> <p>"I know that too," she said. "You are the best boss I've ever had," she said with that smile again. She handed me the plate and said something to Aunt Sally. "It's ready and we'll get to work together," I said, feeling good about that.</p> <p>We finished lunch and walked back into the family room. Mom got us some more of the hot food. I had a big smile and hugged her as she came in. "I've really missed you, Mr. M," she said.</p> <p>"Merry Christmas, Miss Sally," I said, trying to put her at ease.</p> <p>"Do I need to ask how you got this name?" she said in disbelief.</p> <p>"I just think," I replied, trying to keep the smile away from my face.</p> <p>"Why?"</p> <p>"Because I wanted to ask you out. Since you are the most beautiful young woman in the world, are you going to marry me?" I asked her, suddenly realizing what I was asking her.</p> <p>"Oh, I'm sorry. I'm just looking for a good girl."</p> <p>"Do you really?" I asked her. How did she know that if she was going out with me it wasn't going to be because of money? "Are you just trying out a new name?"</p> <p>"I'm just joking around. Now don't think I'm rejecting you. I just meant a date, not a relationship. Is this some kind of commitment?"</p> <p>"No, that's not it at all. I just thought it was an opportunity for you, too. I know you're not going to be with me that day. But that makes you the happiest girl in the universe, don't it?"</p> <p>"Well, if you want to, we can meet back up today," she said. "I would love to be with you today."</p> <p>"I'd like that too," I said, taking her in my arms. She felt like her soul would explode. "This has been one hell of a day. I feel like I'm in love with you. I'm so glad we decided to meet. I don't even know if you understand. I just know I feel we are meant to be together," I said, hugging her as I was thinking about this. We spent the next couple of hours talking about what to do for breakfast.</p> <p>Merry Christmas to Mom, she wanted to thank me for not getting it. When I walked her home, I told her I hadn't finished my lunch. When she stopped to thank me, Mom turned and kissed me on the cheek. I could feel the smile. This was our goodbye, finally, after all this work.</p> <p>"Have a great weekend, Mr. M.," she said at the door and kissed me on my lips as she turned and walked out.</p> <p>Saturday</p> <p>While Sally was eating breakfast, I was looking through her business.
