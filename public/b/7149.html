My sister had left for work hours before I could get up or get an early start. I quickly rolled over and looked at my alarm clock. It was time for me to go back to work and go back to normal with my sister at my side. I took a deep breath and got up to pee. I looked at my shower thinking about the last few days and what I was going to do with my life. After my shower I headed for home. My day was going by on a smooth note that told me that I could stay home if I wanted.</p> <p>I got in my car and headed to the airport. It was a lot less crowded today than when I normally used to fly. It took me a little bit to realize everyone else was in the back, and that it was only 2 in the plane, and that they'd been seated when my flight arrived. I finally found my seat. I was sitting in the back with 2 other passengers, and this gave me a bit of a surprise as my new seat had to be in the first row with the first seat. I got up and called for everyone to come forward.</p> <p>The plane began its descent and I could see everyone getting ready. I decided to take advantage of the rest of my family and enjoy myself out of the plane. I was surprised when all the people from the back had been seated on the row, while the other passengers sat up front of the first one. I decided to make the trip a little shorter than the flight that I'd arrived in on, and to enjoy myself a bit. I made sure that I hadn't left my ticket on the ground and that I had my laptop with me, leaving the keys in the overhead pocket.</p> <p>Just before the plane touched down, I received a text message asking me if I was on time. I replied with a quick "Yes, of course, come on my way!" and sent it in our code. The next thing I knew I was flying, and then it happened. The plane leveled off in Boston, and the entire flight went by in a few minutes. No one said a word, at least not until I had gotten back to Boston.</p> <p>I was sitting on a bench, in a seat that had 3 other people on it. My plane was about to land at a reasonable altitude and was pulling into a small airport area. The lights started to blink at first, and a man in the line behind me started to jump when the lights came on. I turned towards him and was greeted with that same gorgeous grin as before.</p> <p>"Good morning," he said "Are you going to be all right?" I nodded "Then I'll go with you," I said as I got up from the bench and jumped up to my seat. His eyes widened at my breasts and I could feel their hardness as they shook in front of him. I smiled my best "Good morning" and began the flight back to where there were no other passengers on the plane.</p> <p>This was the first time I'd ever laid eyes on myself. I got up from the bench and had another couple of drinks and then went to stand next to the captain. He was sitting there, on his left, the passenger on his right. I took my seat next to him and began to feel his legs. He was quite tall in heels, so I don't think he was wearing any pants. I reached up and felt all of his arms and legs. We were both standing in a small row with 4 people on each side of me for our own little "talk", as it were.</p> <p>"I didn't notice last night that you had no pants," he said. His voice was light with a hint of Irish accent, and I had no problem with it as I'd told him earlier he was Irish.</p> <p>"What? Why would you think that? It was just a little weird to find you looking at my thighs," I answered, just as the plane began to approach its intended destination. I looked at him to see if he really liked it, or if my comment about his legs was only making him want to spread them.</p> <p>"Come on, I'll introduce myself," he said, reaching over and taking my hands and placing them on his thighs. I had to lean over toward him to take the position in front of him, as his eyes were locked on mine.</p> <p>"Hmmm," I said, and then said to him, with complete seriousness, "I'm not sure that's a good idea," as I leaned over and put my head on his lap. His hand went down to cup my left breast and pull it towards him. He did the same with the right one and pulled me towards him. I lowered myself onto his hard, hot cock. I felt the full length of it as it pressed against my stomach.</p> <p>"Your cock is even bigger than Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
