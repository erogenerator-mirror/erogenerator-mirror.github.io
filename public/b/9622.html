I slowly opened the door until I was inside and got the shock of my life. The room was filled with a huge, king sized bed, with a huge, soft white duvet covering it all. I tried to look around for her, but she just came to my side. She was sitting on the bed waiting and smiling, "Oooooh! What are you doing?" I didn't say a word as she removed her coat and threw it to the floor. "You are not to touch me without my permission." She whispered, "You cannot touch me without my permission"</p> <p>It was true, I was not allowed to touch her without her permission. At least I could not touch her where I had been when I wanted her. However I had to do it, and I had to have her, not just touch. I slowly pulled down my pants and underwear and climbed into the bed, taking hold of the bed cover with both hands. I laid on the bed, my hands slowly coming up to caress her, I got the message, so I gently moved my left hand around, until my hand touched on her breasts. I felt her body shake as I touched on them and I felt her breathing increase. I moved my hand down to her crotch, she was completely naked. Her panties were wet. I began to caress her and feel her soft, warm body. Then my hands were covered with her juices. Her nipples became rock hard as my fingers slowly caressed them, sending them into overdrive. There was a silence in the room, as if I was just listening in and was about to speak but was interrupted by the clinking of the ice cubes in the ice bucket.</p> <p>I felt her body move in a way that made me think that she was not in a world of her own. I slowly continued to caress myself as I felt her legs opened and my cock started to twitch. I removed my hands and removed her panties, she smiled down at me as my cock came free, it was even larger than it had been. I lay down beside her and put my face between her legs, I kissed her mound, she tasted like honey and her body was shaking. I reached her pussy, it was sticky and wet with my own juices, I took my finger and put it in her mouth and she licked it clean, as she moaned, I was so turned on from touching her, all she had to do was open her eyes and see what I was doing to her. Her eyes opened and she smiled as she noticed my new, smaller cock in the room. She looked at me and smiled.</p> <p>I lowered my body and we were both naked. Then she felt around for her clothes and placed them in a drawer. Next to them were a towel which I took away to wash. I sat on the bed, I took her hands and put them on my shoulder, I rubbed them all over me, my hands got so hot and slippery with sweat, I felt her body on my skin and I wanted to do more. I then moved out of the bed and got the towel and I started to put it on her. I moved her hands to a standing position. I lay down on her, I started to kiss her neck, then she turned her face and we passionately kissed, our lips and tongues slowly and gently touched each other's lips as it came. Our kiss became more and more intimate, our tongues began to move with the other's, we started to kiss each other harder, our mouths open mouthed, our kisses became urgent as her hands were all over my body, she was feeling every part of my body, my face, my chest; and she touched me as if it were a life machine. I moved my hand down her body and touched the sides of her panties, my eyes were aflame with passion and lust as we were one, the kiss continued, her body was still shaking and her nipples were hard, but she wanted it a lot.</p> <p>I stood up from her and looked at her, my cock made two small tent poles, and she was staring at it, it was a strange shade of pink, but it was all right as my lips came down and softly touched her breast, her nipple was large and it felt a bit soft, as I gently started to massage it. I kissed and lick her breasts slowly, I slowly kissed her body all over, her skin felt beautiful and I love her body. I got down on top her body and got in between her legs. I was so hot with lust, she opened them to my face, I gently moved my way down and lay down on her. Our lips met again and our tongues caressed the other as her hands were exploring my front as her body was caressing mine. I laid back down and she was looking at me while we were making the next moves. I slowly moved her hands up and down my body as my back started to archâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
