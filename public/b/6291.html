"You better get some water or you might drown!"</p> <p>"But if I get some cold water I might drown!" Eric said and laughed even louder.</p> <p>"I should never have invited such people to my wedding!" Eric exclaimed. "I'm getting tired of the wedding!"</p> <p>"Your loss, you'll soon learn," the doctor said as he got up from the table. "Dr. Reynolds can go for it. She said she will go get my bottle of water and a napkin so you can make sure it's clean."</p> <p>"Well... I guess I'm not as old as I look!" Eric exclaimed.</p> <p>"You certainly do," the doctor said as he came back with two napkins and a napkin.</p> <p>I don't go to sleep very often so I'm not so good at keeping myself under control, Eric said as he helped me to my feet. I sat on one of the recliners in the guest room and Eric started to help me with my dress.</p> <p>"It's a little loose," he said, looking in the mirror on the wardrobe. "Can we go change? I'm tired of looking." as he pulled my dress over my head.</p> <p>"Of course!" I said as Eric helped me put on the dress. "I'm sure you'll find you're never going to see me naked again!"</p> <p>"You know I would!" Eric said as he picked me up and walked down the hall toward the guest room where I was sleeping.</p> <p>I closed my eyes and went on my way, my heart skipping a beat as I walked across the hallway in Eric's arms.</p> <p>It was a little after noon when I got up and left for the hospital. I got down as the warm rays of the sun filtered through the thin curtains. As I lay on my stomach and tried to rest, I thought about my conversation with Dr. Reynolds earlier today. I'd gotten her to tell me everything about how Eric and Jake had looked at her like she was a sex object and a sex toy. After reading her reports, seeing her reaction once she'd said it, I felt like I had to ask.</p> <p>"Did Eric and Jake ever feel the same way? Why do they do? Did they like it if they had a beautiful young woman? Did they like it if it was just my size?"</p> <p>"I'm not kidding!" I said as I started to get up and look around for a pillow. But as I looked, Dr. Reynolds was lying on the floor, her legs spread wide, her fingers pressing on the insides of her thighs, her breasts jiggling. I could almost see her face in the room.</p> <p>As I tried to get up she spread her legs and pulled her fingers away, her eyes locked on mine.</p> <p>"You're still alive?" I asked.</p> <p>"No," she said but I could hear a smirk. "He'll probably be okay until late. Maybe I'll still be able to seduce you after his wife sees you."</p> <p>"You think so? Maybe they would feel the same way?" I asked.</p> <p>"Maybe," she replied. "Maybe if I got into his pants..."</p> <p>"Well we have to find a way to persuade them to leave his penis alone for a month or two," I thought.</p> <p>"No, wait a minute!" she said as she got up and went into her bathroom to change.</p> <p>"What's wrong with me?" I asked her after I caught up with her.</p> <p>"Eric said you would have to find a way to get off on his penis." she smiled.</p> <p>We drove back to the hotel late that afternoon. When we arrived to collect the van at the ER we found Eric lying naked on the floor, his hand between two penises that were erect and pointing up at the ceiling. He smiled again as he saw me.</p> <p>"I can't wait until Saturday!" he said to me. "I'll go and get some supper if you're up for a little supper." "I'm up for anything that's left," I told him.</p> <p>"There's plenty of room on the couch," he told me as he put his arms around me. "I'm sure you can get it up enough to do it."</p> <p>After we were in the car I gave him the finger to kiss me and told him I loved him, and he got in the other car.</p> <p>"But I don't have to do all these things!" I said as we left the hospital and I watched as Dr. Reynolds got out of his car and got in.</p> <p>"But I think it would be worth it!"
