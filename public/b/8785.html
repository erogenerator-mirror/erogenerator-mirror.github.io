He pulled up, wiped the cum off his chin with both hands and then leaned in and licked some of it off my chin.</p> <p>“Mmmm . . . You taste real nice.” He said and gave my cock a couple tugs. It was hardening again in record time. I saw what he was doing and it was making it difficult to hold out even for just a few seconds but he took it slow and really worked me up.</p> <p>He continued to work on me and I reached down and felt him rubbing the lube around a little. “It’ll be cool to be able to stand. What do you want me to do with these?” he asked.</p> <p>“I know I’m not going to last long with these, but I sure want to have you ride me.” I told him.</p> <p>“Oh, you will!” he said and then took my cock in his hand and started slowly stroking me up and down. That was enough to bring me quickly to the edge then he withdrew his hand and put both of his over his ass.</p> <p>“Push a little.” He told me.” Push a little more, just push right on that little nub.” He said as my cock slid out of him.</p> <p>I pushed a little and got another little of his lube in me. He pulled off and we traded with him stroking me. “Put your cock on that little nub and slide it all the way in,” he said. “I want to feel you all the way up to that little bump on the back of your cock.” He told me and then he did it.</p> <p>My wife of twelve months was making me the first to cum in her mouth the first time.</p> <p>I could feel his ass pushing against mine as I pushed up into him. All of the built up sensations I had experienced before had made me explode in almost no time. I felt myself getting closer to the brink and then I stopped and pulled back so no cum was coming on my cock.</p> <p>He looked at me as we lay there talking.</p> <p>“Let me feel you cum on my cock. Let me feel how you fill me up with your hot juices.” I told him.</p> <p>“Can you do it or did you plan on doing something else?” he asked me.</p> <p>“Your cum on my tits, your cock in my ass and I can’t have you cumming on me that way,” said he.</p> <p>We lay there catching our breath and talking for the next couple of hours.</p> <p>We got up and washed ourselves and dressed. I pulled on a clean shirt and we ate dinner and did a little yard work. The rest of the time was pretty cool but not as much as it had been.</p> <p>We talked about the last time I tried to make love to my wife and how much we had enjoyed it even though there wasn’t much physical activity involved. We talked about her and how good it felt to have been with me and how hard her nipples were.</p> <p>Then it was just about time to put the car away and go to bed. We didn’t really have very much time and we were going to have to get home when it was decided by our husband that we were going to go to bed together.</p> <p>We got in our cars and I took the car down to the beach and we took our clothes off, got into bed and went to sleep. We had about an hour until we got to the restaurant for a couple of hours of sex, but by that time things had got to where they needed to be. I got the car and went into town to pick up some things.</p> <p>When I walked back into the bedroom, she was sitting on the couch, her legs still open and just staring the whole time at me. “What’s on your mind?” I asked.</p> <p>“I think we should talk. After what you do to me in the last couple weeks I think it’s about time we talked. I want to tell you how much I enjoyed our little night of love and passion. But first let me get you started.” She stood up and removed her shirt.</p> <p>“Are you ready?” I asked as I stood and removed my clothes, standing in front of her naked for the first time.</p> <p>“No! I told you it’d be a good night first. Maybe you can make it up to me when we get back home.
