Well, it's not even your girlfriend any more. You don't love me, you just love fucking me."</p> <p>"What? I love you? You're a fuck slut?" he shouted.</p> <p>Shannon laughed, "I'm going to try my best to make you happy baby. I know it's wrong but I've always had a thing for you. I think the best way is to get you to want me back and it's already happen. I'll try and make you feel good."</p> <p>"No! I love you so much this can't happen," he cried out.</p> <p>"No baby, you got me," she whispered. He reached back and grabbed her ass grabbing her with both hands. He lifted her, and placed her on the couch. He moved her on her back and spread her legs. He put her knees over his shoulders and pushed his cock into her.</p> <p>He leaned forward and kissed Shannon and she tasted herself on his lips. She let him pull her lips back to his. He was thrusting as hard as he could, and she was moaning as he thrust inside of her. They were both moaning and groaning. He could feel her pussy clench around his cock and knew he was close. He pushed himself forward. He thrust hard and she let out a scream which he took as a reply and pushed deeper inside of her. He reached down and grabbed her tits and pressed them together. She was squealing and moaning and she let him continue thrusting on her.</p> <p>Shannon's hand fell over his head. It was one of the best orgasms of her young life while he fucked her. She could feel him thrusting harder. He moaned and pushed harder, pulling her down and then back against him. He felt so good. He pulled back and then shoved hard in again. Shannon held him and lifted her legs allowing him to thrust harder. He held onto her hard and pulled at them as he pounded into her. She held on tight to his muscular butt and squeezed. He thrust one last time and pumped load after load deep inside of her. He pushed deep inside of her feeling her inner muscles grip at him. He could feel his cum pump into her and it triggered his final orgasm. She held him tight feeling her inner muscles tighten and then she collapsed on the couch panting, trying to catch her breath. He fell on top of her and they lay there panting and recovering. Shannon turned her over so they could see each other's faces. He began to run his hand over Shannon's face seeing the pleasure there. There was also something oddly familiar in her eyes. They both looked as if they had just fallen asleep.</p> <p>When he pulled up his shorts and shorts, he said, "Honey, would you come to my house so we can talk?"</p> <p>She didn't answer. She was too tired to answer. He looked over at her and said, "Come on honey, I've still got a lot to talk with you."</p> <p>"Why? You don't just come on to me do you?" Shannon said.</p> <p>"Honey, I'm not some stranger. I'm not some high class hooker. I'm not some whore just like you described yourself."</p> <p>Shannon stared at him. He looked so much like her that she wondered if he was real. There were dark circles in her eyes. She smiled at him and turned to go.</p> <p>"We don't do this, you know we just got done." Shannon said.</p> <p>"Well I understand. But I just wanted to make sure."</p> <p>"What do you mean baby."</p> <p>"Come on baby. Let's go. This doesn't have to be any fun," he said as he turned and walked towards the front door.</p> <p>As Shannon and the boys walked by a truck parked by a hotel, a man walked towards them. He was carrying a suitcase he had bought.</p> <p>The first thing Shannon saw when she walked in was that this truck had three guys in it. Her eyes widened.</p> <p>It started and then stopped. There was a big guy on the side with them. He had a large butt crack and a cock that looked like it was the size of the end of his cock. It was long and black sticking out from the front. As an older man, the largest part of the group, the men were around five foot four with short brown hair. The guys were black and it looked like a man had a pair of jocks over his butt crack. Both men's dicks were long and hung down to where the legs were. As the guy walked into the truck, the shorter black man got in.</p> <p>The guy that Shannon had seenâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
