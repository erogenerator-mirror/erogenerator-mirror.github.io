Come and sleep in my arms," she whispered again. She kissed me lightly, then rolled over and fell into the bed next to me, spooning. She cuddled up to me, and we fell into a deep sleep.</p> <p>When we woke, there was a light dinner waiting for us. For the next couple of hours we talked, chatted, and enjoyed each other, the wine bringing us to a new equilibrium in our mutual relationships. I found that Sarah had a way of taking away any guilt I'd felt when she had first touched me, leaving me feeling better for a change. Her presence was making me feel so much better for the love I thought I had for my friend. As well, I felt I was starting to feel that bond again, to love her without judgment or guilt.</p> <p>After dinner we moved to our room where we both took advantage of our newfound closeness again. As my roommate and I made love I made sure that Sarah knew that what we're doing was totally Ok. When we were kissing and fondling each other, it was all just for show. I felt so sexy and wanted for her to feel the same way. It had been so intense and so beautiful to watch her get that thrill again. It showed me how much she loved me, and knew exactly how to love me in return, which she never did with my partner. When we finally came to our senses and got up to head to bed, I could not take my eyes off her all night long. As soon as the door closed behind her she was on me again, the passion we shared last night was just as intense as the morning after that. We fell into a deep and happy sleep, and woke up together on another bed. We both had the same idea. I was going to take her back to bed again.</p> <p>The whole morning ritual, which we used to start with kisses and a caressing was nothing like what we had just done. As I lay naked and naked with Sarah in bed, feeling the warmth of my body against hers, I could not help myself. I wanted more, and felt the fire within me rise. I wanted her forever, like I've never wanted anything as much as I thought I wanted her.</p> <p>As she slid down my body, I felt a soft gentle caress on my thighs, and a touch that surprised me even more than before. It was no longer that subtle touch, its caress felt like the touch I wanted, though it was not quite that gentle. My legs spread for her to go under them, my knees bent so she could hold them up high, and her hands cupped my ass, pulling me down on the bed.</p> <p>After kissing her face for a few minutes, she kissed me on the mouth. I knew that what she was about to do had to be something I was going to do. I had to be a part of it, but at the same time, I was also trying to decide what to do. Should I kiss her again, or should I try to kiss her more passionately? Should I try to kiss her more gently? Should we explore each other more sensually?</p> <p>"We have to make up for the way the night just ended. We must be more gentle tonight, and we have the right idea about what we want from you." Sarah whispered as she kissed my lips again.</p> <p>I just laid there, feeling more than looking at her. She looked beautiful lying there, naked, just like this. It must be the wine and her body. I just thought I could not resist her any longer.</p> <p>After a few minutes of this, we rolled over together. She pulled me on top of her, and with one quick thrust, my cock was inside her. She lifted her legs up and around each side of me, and I kissed her. I held her face between my hands as we kissed, enjoying the sensation.</p> <p>I moved my hips, slowly, and we both felt a strong stirring inside me. Sarah's pussy was on fire and ready to welcome me in. I felt like a rock, ready to burst. I leaned back, pulling her legs up to give me more room to move. I leaned forward, my cock just getting a little deeper with each thrust. I looked back into her eyes. She smiled and moved her hips so I could fuck her deeper.</p> <p>As her hips moved up and down, I started to thrust. She loved it, and I was trying to match that with each thrust I felt. It felt like I was making love to her soul, the heart inside her. I didn't want to come too soon, but I decided to go slowly and build to it.</p> <p>As we continued to kiss, I felt a strong stirring of her hips, and she told me to go faster. As I thrust faster, I felt her hips move, and we both realizedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
