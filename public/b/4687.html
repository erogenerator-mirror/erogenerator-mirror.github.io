One of her friends, Kelly, went around town to pick up guys that she knew. Her friends were like her best friend at first and she went to a lot of friends over the weeks. Each time they came back it was usually with the guy. However, Kelly always went to a sex club she used to go to at least once a week. That weekend she had stayed with her ex-boyfriend that weekend. She thought he had done what she needed him to do. Kelly thought it was cool that he liked making love to her. It meant that he would do anything and she would get that same kind of feeling she got that weekend with Tony.</p> <p>Tony was very good to her. He had been like that all of his life. That's how good he could be. He was also a real gentleman as well as the best fuck in the world. It was hard to say if either or both of them liked it. Kelly, however, was not so sure if he liked it. She did, however, love it. She had even talked with him after she had felt sorry for it. He loved showing her things he had written in her head over the years to which she still needed some help and then she would take him back for her own.</p> <p>Kelly had told her ex-boyfriend about it. She had known that he was going to ask her out. They had both been very surprised when he didn't call her at all. He seemed pretty upset though. She wanted to see him. She wanted to get back to Tony. This had been going well. They had met and it had never gone beyond a friendly hug and maybe a kiss. He always seemed to be so nice and sincere. There was no mistaking how close they were. She was actually feeling a little jealous at times. It really bothered her though. She liked him and the feeling did help her feel better.</p> <p>Tony had said he missed fucking Kelly, especially if it was with somebody that was nice. He had been disappointed a little when he couldn't keep his hands off of her. Kelly liked to get him to be forceful and she didn't want to be the one who made him. Kelly was a bit surprised that his girlfriend was a whore. The sex club had been just a small place though which was the reason for their breakup. She was just a simple woman and she wanted to feel free and just fuck the man that she loved. Even though she had fucked Tony, they had never really talked about it. They had only been good friends and friends with benefits. Kelly could still enjoy a good old fuck and she knew, if she was good for an occasional fuck it wouldn't hurt and she knew she would not say no once Tony left for college. Even though she really enjoyed the experience, she wasn't sure if it would be good.</p> <p>She went to work for an hour that week and just sat there in her office. After hours of getting her ass over in time to get ready to graduate work, she had decided to head home. She put on her normal business attire and got ready to leave. She had packed her coat and her purse when she was just leaving. A small amount of her favorite perfume, she thought to herself. She slipped it on. It was a very sexy fragrance. It was very expensive. She knew it would be expensive but she never knew the cost. It also had made her realize the cost of getting a better degree actually seemed to bother him.</p> <p>She had thought back to earlier that week when it was more of a relationship but when the man she loved had been replaced she felt that it was time again and to be honest it was very hard for her. The men she loved didn't treat her the way she enjoyed the sex but she just felt empty. The woman that the man had loved was gone and it had been replaced by one that left her breathless and wanting. She had felt disappointed. She had always felt guilty over that. The men that Tony loved didn't satisfy her or make her feel like she was out of her league. The only thing she ever had was someone nice. Even though she loved the sex with the men that she loved she couldn't enjoy a good relationship with anyone. She loved life with Tony.</p> <p>Tony and Kelly had never been a sexual couple. He was very much into her and she loved that. She had no idea if that love would ever come between them and it wasn't exactly good to have a relationship for them. They had grown up on just a few blocks or so from each other. It wasn't that he was just going to fuck her and expect her to fall for him. It was just that he felt that it made it hard. He got angry when he realized he did have a need for her.</p> <p>Kelly had talked about it often. Sometimes when she came home for work her mind would wander to what Tony had done that week.
