I had hoped, as it turned out, that her boyfriend would be interested in me. Not wanting his wife to get the wrong idea it was too good to share him with a girl. I mean I never thought I would ever consider fucking another man, but it never crossed my mind. I guess I was curious. I had thought the more we fucked the more we could be satisfied. Now I think that we could really enjoy each other.</p> <p>'You know, the things I was doing with Tom and Jack were totally different,' Lisa said</p> <p>'I know. I felt as if I was in the middle of something, but it always happened somewhere else. Did I enjoy the thought of going to another man's house, the thought of sucking off a stranger for a change? I loved it. I got that feeling, which only happens after you've cum once too many.'</p> <p>'You made that happen. Well I think it must have looked hot, being with two men, sharing you, sharing your pussy. It was just as hot as I knew it would be,' Lisa admitted.</p> <p>'So I've told you everything about my life,' I told her.</p> <p>'Yes and you've told me all about your life from now on. We're both going to find we really are a pair of good friends of the right kind.' As she spoke Lisa turned her eyes to the screen and saw the woman's face. She knew I was on that point. I saw her eyes widen at the camera. I saw her eyes go up to see my face. Our eyes locked for a moment before she started to speak. I thought she had an unspoken question. I hoped it didn't show.</p> <p>'Oh God, Lisa, I never thought what I hoped was coming.' Her words came out softly.</p> <p>'Neither have I. I hope you enjoy it. I know you will, I will,' she told her.</p> <p>'You're serious?' I asked</p> <p>'Absolutely. We'll see how many times we do. I mean it's you that's the lucky one, I mean, you do it for me. The way you are always making up for it,' she said.</p> <p>'Wow,' was all I could get out.</p> <p>'Well, it's my choice, not yours,' she said. She was going to see if she could go further. I needed her to tell me how she felt about the idea. I needed to know if I'd be willing to continue.' She paused, thinking a moment. 'I think you've had your doubts as to what was happening, haven't you,' she asked.</p> <p>'Of course I have. I couldn't help it, it was the first time, and I know you wouldn't hurt me. You were as willing as to want to experience something else,' I agreed. I wanted her to be there. I wanted to know what it really was like. And I wanted to know what it would feel like to have sex with her.</p> <p>'So we were together,' she said and then smiled. 'I was with you so it was nice, but I was the one to be the one to be the one to fuck for that purpose,' she told me. She told me she got carried away in her own mind when she started to talk about her life. I guess that I understood she was trying to talk me out of a decision.</p> <p>'That's my decision, too,' I told her. I really wished I could tell her exactly what I thought. It still felt like a dream. I hadn't even thought about it before. I thought I was going to get away with telling her about my sexual experiences. I didn't even know if I could. If I had.</p> <p>'We can make love, at this stage, whenever you like, or you can stay in touch in your room and share me with the person you like. You've done that already. What's the difference between sharing me?' Lisa asked.</p> <p>'You're the one whose pussy is wet. That's how we're going to share a woman,' I told her.</p> <p>'How can I make that happen if it's going to happen? You've given me everything I want, even from the first time.' She asked. I think she hoped I was going to convince her that I was going to have to share her.</p> <p>'I'm here right here. I know you've done this for me. The first time was easy. I'm not exactly sure why.' I knew she was trying to keep in mind what she was experiencing, but it was hard to explain how.</p> <p>'You're all I had, until I met you... and you,' she finished me in. 'You have always been a part of me. That was the first time I'd ever really touched it. So do you think we will have sexâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
