As it turned out that Monday, Jack came over on his own, and he started to talk about the weather. That seemed to get my attention, so I asked him questions as to what had been going, and what we like to do. When he made up with his answers, he went to the bathroom to take off his shorts and get himself up. When he emerged, it was clear he was a little nervous about things, and I hoped his discomfort was not noticeable to me. When he looked back down, the first thing he saw was my hand.</p> <p>"See," I said, "the trouble with the shorts?"</p> <p>"No, I just thought you'd have thought that I would lose weight if I let you take them off. I haven't lost weight in years," he said, trying to get a feel for how much weight. He actually smiled and gave my hand a squeeze.</p> <p>"Jack," I replied, "would you be able to make me a new pair tomorrow?"</p> <p>"Certainly," he said, "but remember we are friends, I'll take you out to dinner."</p> <p>"Yeah, of course, I will," I said.</p> <p>"We would be very excited," he added with a leer. He looked around the class again to make sure no one had noticed him. "Well?" he said, "shall we get ready and go eat?" he said, and I quickly replied, as he pulled up my skirt, "OK, I guess we can do that, huh?"</p> <p>We got into his car and we drove to the Italian restaurant he owned. It was in a corner of our town, and Jack showed all the way up to the valet and checked me in. I walked in front of him as we drove to the restaurant, and looked around the restaurant as he put the car in park.</p> <p>"You look great," he said, "did you change?"</p> <p>"I don't think I should look at the rest of your clothes."</p> <p>"I think you want my clothes," he said.</p> <p>I gave him a teasing look. "Go take them off and put on a suit. No underwear."</p> <p>I pulled off my skirt and t-shirt, and his eyes feasted on my pussy. I think I was the only one who was the least self conscious of the two of us.</p> <p>"Are you ready?"</p> <p>"Yes, very good sir."</p> <p>"Let's go get a drink." He motioned around to an empty bar. On his way back to me, he turned to me and said, "We are even in this town, aren't we?"</p> <p>"Yes sir," I replied.</p> <p>He was a very charming, and I am looking forward to a much more experienced man, I thought. After he left, I turned around, facing the door. He looked in my eyes, and slowly licked his lips. I slowly stood up, looked down, and turned around.</p> <p>"You look very nice," he said.</p> <p>I blushed.</p> <p>"It's ok," I said, "you look pretty much the same."</p> <p>"Yeah," he said.</p> <p>I had gotten used to the nervousness of the day, and I was getting to like it. I was also getting turned on.</p> <p>"Jack," I said, "do you mind if I take these off?"</p> <p>"No, not at all," he smiled.</p> <p>I took off his shirt, and he pulled his own off. I saw that he had nothing on under the pants and shoes, but of course my gaze caught on his perfect ass. He was wearing a tight, white shirt, and it hugged his body as he walked. As he returned my gaze, my desire became intense. I unbuttoned his pants, and took them off. His cock and balls were hanging off his waist, but what I had seen earlier had been all I could take, and I had a hardon in just a matter of minutes.</p> <p>Jack sat down at a small table in the back, and took my hand. He stood me up so I could sit down, and he pulled down my slacks. I lifted my hips and helped him slide them off. He laid me back and leaned over to my lips.</p> <p>"Mmmmm," he said. "You really taste good, too."</p> <p>"So do you," I said.
