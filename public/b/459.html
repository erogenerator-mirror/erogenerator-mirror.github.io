"No way! No way!"</p> <p>"You have no idea what it's like," I told her, reaching out to give her a light slap across the face before we continued the trip into the bedroom.</p> <p>The two of us were silent. There was no point in getting into it, we didn't really know the other one. We were both lost in my eyes again, neither one of us speaking.</p> <p>"I love you, too," I said to her.</p> <p>"And I you. But I still love you. You're the only one I feel like I can have this." I squeezed her hand and kissed her hand.</p> <p>I started to move towards her, but she pushed me away and put a finger to her lips.</p> <p>"Hush," she said with a sexy smile in her eyes and kissed me.</p> <p>Then she stood up, turned around and grabbed the back of my head in her hands and kissed me with a hunger that was so intense; I was sure my insides would turn to jelly at the thought just how much we loved each other. She pressed her lips to mine for the longest time as our hands massaged each other. I couldn't remember the last time I had had feelings like she was giving me. She pressed her breasts into my hands as we continued to kiss. I could feel her pussy pressed firmly against my thigh as she felt the hardness of my cock. She broke away again, grabbed my cock, and sucked it into her mouth. I felt my heart thump in my chest as she sucked it and licked it. I closed my eyes and lay on my back, enjoying the erotic experience. She lifted up her hips and my cock was still in her mouth while her tongue ran over it. "I love having you in my mouth," she said into my ear.</p> <p>"Do you know how long it would take me to get hard?" she asked.</p> <p>"It would be like making love," I said, "like when I get hard thinking about you, touching you, feeling you."</p> <p>"I really do love how big you are," she told me, "I love the way you feel inside of me as I stroke you. It's like you're in a dream as if I'm real here."</p> <p>She kissed her way down my chest and took my cock into her hand and started to stroke it just like she always did, only much smaller. I could feel how hard it was and her hand was moving it up and down, up and down. It felt incredible. All of a sudden she took all of my cock into her mouth and she started to move her head rapidly, making my body tremble. Suddenly she stopped moving on my cock, just keeping her lips around it. She opened her eyes and looked straight into mine. "I want you to make love to me," she said huskily, and lowered herself on me.</p> <p>Her full pussy slid slowly down onto me, my balls pressing against her ass. She started to move up and down on me, our skin slapping together. It was so intensely intense and arousing that I could barely move. I wrapped my hands around her body and put my arms around her as she fucked me, moving her hips hard and fast. I could feel her pussy tightening against mine over and over again. She looked back at me with her big dark eyes and said, "Are you sure you're really in love with me?"</p> <p>I pulled her tight to me, kissing her neck with my lips. "Yes, I'm in love with you," I said between kisses.</p> <p>She put both hands on my chest and lay there on top of me, her hair on my face and her breasts flattened against my chest. "I think you're in love with me too," she said as she gently ran her hand down my chest and rubbed her soft pussy over my cock. There was still something about the way her hand felt just like it had felt a thousand times in those past eight seconds. I felt like I belonged to her. I felt it as if her body belonged to me. "I could never leave you," I said.</p> <p>"I'm so glad," she said, her pussy still rubbing up and down on my cock. "I'll never leave you."</p> <p>We lay there for a long time as we just let the feeling of our love grow and grow. Then she rolled off of me, put her arms around me, and we lay there on my bed. I could still feel those same emotions as she was inside of me in those three seconds. It felt like I was inside of heaven right now.</p> <p>"I'm glad you came to my rescue," she said quietly. "I don't think I've ever been happier. I'm in love with youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
