She also found a note that she felt very comfortable going there with them. She said, "As a woman I should feel free to go out on the town."</p> <p>All four of them just laughed at her comment, then they each agreed. Sarah got a small suitcase and a spare overnight bag, along with a few other essentials. As they drove to the cabin Sarah wondered how she could make herself comfortable on the couch. A simple dinner with wine and some soft laughter seemed to do wonders for her spirits, but she had to ask more questions.</p> <p>"I asked if my husband would mind if I stayed in town with me, he doesn't know much about the town and I only saw him a couple of days." Sarah went on to tell them where she had gone, but before he could take the whole sentence he had to give her his name. "The cabin is in a fairly large city, at the end about 50 miles away. The town is only on a one-mile bike path, and you have to go around the turn at the end of the trail so you're safe to have a ride without people seeing you." Sarah told them.</p> <p>"I've been driving around the town every day for many days now, driving the bike or walking, but there was no one coming before noon, or you'll be left in the car waiting to get the bus back." Sarah told them, trying to think of where her husband was.</p> <p>"It'll be fine. I promise." Sarah told them, the excitement of being on a motorcycle again starting to get to her, Sarah told the six of them.</p> <p>"If you don't want to go, please go. I really liked the idea of going and now I think I want to go." Sarah told them. She said, "But first we need a shower." Sarah got out of the car to show them the shower she had in the bathroom. After Sarah showered, they each took off their clothes and showered together. Sarah and Mike had already put on soft makeup after making sure they got every inch of their bodies on display. Sarah looked great with them both in her large bedroom. Sarah and Mike were so friendly and funny, joking and laughing with each other on several occasions. When Sarah went into her bedroom she changed into another pair of loose shorts and a thin t-shirt, and then picked up her bag and began to put on a clean t-shirt.</p> <p>Mike quickly finished up in the washroom and was able to leave. Sarah was just finishing pulling on her clean t-shirt, while Mike finished getting dressed. Sarah looked at her husband and just smiled and told him everything was ok and left them alone. Mike went to the other room and dressed himself, then went into the kitchen to get another wine, then returned to their home to find Sarah and Mike in the backyard.</p> <p>Sarah smiled at her husband, "So how do you doin?</p> <p>"Great. I mean I've been a bit on the chubby side lately, but now I'm feeling good." Mike tried to explain to Sarah.</p> <p>Mike sat there thinking about this, wondering if he could get her to go out with him tonight. He looked at Sarah's body. The loose outfit she had on was really making him feel good. He also couldn't help noticing how nice Sarah's breasts were. They sagged a bit, but Sarah was a lot more fun to look at. The tight top showed her nicely, but Mike felt himself getting turned on again. He decided to take Sarah up on her offer. Sarah was a pretty woman, and Mike felt he had to show her off to his friends a bit to get her attention.</p> <p>After looking around while talking to her husband, Mike went into the house, and came back with another bottle of wine. He sat the bottle down then took Sarah in his arms, laying him down on the couch. Sarah sat down beside Mike, and he reached over and began to kiss her. Mike's hands came up and gently cupped Sarah's breasts, her nipples were rock hard already, and as he felt her breasts in his hand Sarah's nipples became rock hard. Mike slowly lowered his body down on top of Sarah, and when Sarah felt his cock touch her pussy lips, she instinctively spread her legs a little allowing Mike access. Mike then lowered his body back down on top of Sarah, and as his erection began to press into Sarah, she gently arched her back giving him better access. Sarah moaned as Mike was able to slide himself between her legs and as Mike's cock began to slowly slide between her pussy lips, Sarah raised her hips, trying to make him slide deeper inside her.</p> <p>Mike was starting to have second thoughts, if he had only had a little more time. He wanted to give Sarah pleasure, butâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
