They were small but with the large pinkish-brown areola peeking from the top, it looked like a natural tan. They sagged a bit, with a slight curvature to just below the breast. However, it made them look a bit firmer as I was braless and very full without being too large. They stood and jiggled a bit when he walked over to examine them.</p> <p>When he came back to my table (his back was to me) and he saw what I was watching, he started laughing and said, "You don't really like being watched, do you?" I blushed even more and told him that I liked being watched, in fact I enjoyed it. He smiled, and said, "Yes, I thought that was obvious and when I said no I thought it was funny. Are those big nipples sticking out?" His eyes dropped down a bit to my cleavage and he said "Not as large as I thought they would be and maybe a bit firmer but no, no. It's a good thing they're big. " I blushed harder and said "I think that might be what you mean, I never have had bigger breasts before. I'm glad you like them." He agreed, smiled and said, "That's exactly what I mean. You are very beautiful and I'm very happy with the attention you are getting."</p> <p>Our waiter arrived to take our order and, as he entered the kitchen, I asked him to look over the dishes. "You seem familiar with having all the kitchen work done. That reminds of a man." I said, looking at the kitchen wall and smiling to myself. John laughed and said, "There you go." And, I did not know what that meant until he smiled and said, "That's just the way he likes to be seen. No doubt about it!" I smiled and asked him with a grin, "Can't you tell? Is your breasts smaller than my husband's?" he laughed and said, "Very! I'm a bit embarrassed to admit it, but when women have nice titties and when they have nice big nipples, if you like big ones, they're fine, especially when a man is looking at big ones."</p> <p>I looked at the menu and was looking around the kitchen. "Let me try the dishes out some other time," I said. He turned as he was leaving and said, "I believe you are right. They are a nice set. The salad, of course, is all you need. " I nodded and smiled, but still smiled and shook my head, "No offense, but if you would prefer to keep your breasts out of the direct water, please don't put me on. I'm just having a glass of something and just don't want to get upset."</p> <p>John's eyes lit up when I said this and I smiled. "It's the salad that was made for me. It's good. It's the type of salad that is good for people, in my experience. I'm having a salad dinner with some of the local prosciutto's I keep in my pantry and my wife likes it. I love having all those things in my house, but it's nice to see it all in your kitchen. Now, would you mind going upstairs and changing while I finish up the salad?"</p> <p>John smiled and said, "Sure. Anything else for you?" and he turned around and headed up the stairs to his bedroom.</p> <p>I could feel my own pussy getting wet as I thought about him going up the stairs. I didn't know whether to go topless or not, what had happened when I was looking at his body, but I decided, "Well, no problem. I'll be getting some of the other items for the salad and do my washing off. I just have to get back to my room to change."</p> <p>I finished my salad and returned to the kitchen. "Did you and the other lady enjoy watching us?" I asked and saw him smile and blush.</p> <p>"Yes, we did." John said, as he turned and returned me to my chair. I noticed he got a quick glance down at my breasts again when he saw them. "I guess that was enough for the time being." I smiled and smiled back, "Yes! I think that was enough for me too. Thank you. I think that was all I really needed to experience my surprise." I felt his eyes on me and he grinned back at me.</p> <p>"Oh, my god. I'm glad you enjoyed it." When I smiled back he got right in my face and said, "This little surprise may not be complete when you're back home?"</p> <p>I was stunned at his question but agreed, "I don't know. Your wife didn't let me put it in.
