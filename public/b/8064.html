"You're going to be spending all your time at a university of some quality."</p> <p>"I know. But..."</p> <p>"But then you won't be able to walk," he said as he walked quickly towards her.</p> <p>"It...It doesn't mean..." she said, looking up at him, her face turning so red that she could actually run away and get back into her apartment.</p> <p>"It says on the house?" he said with a grin. "So you know you're mine."</p> <p>"Yes," she said looking up into his eyes.</p> <p>He smirked and went right back to his seat.</p> <p>***************</p> <p>"So...?" he asked. He'd taken his seat as he looked over in the mirror of the dressing rooms. He was staring into his reflection when it clicked. "What?" he thought.</p> <p>"That didn't work, did it?"</p> <p>"No, it didn't work," he said as he stared back at the mirror. "It didn't work either."</p> <p>"What's on your mind?" She asked with a smile. "You have to admit you're attracted to me."</p> <p>"Um...um...is there something personal at work I like?" Chris asked. "Hmmm...are you aware of how much it's a work place for guys? I mean...you and I...we are just getting to know each other so well."</p> <p>She felt a tug at her sleeve. Was she feeling the same way?</p> <p>"Maybe there is something," she said smiling back at him. "But not to say that it's something you'll miss doing for a little bit."</p> <p>He just nodded his head before staring at the mirror again.</p> <p>"So..." he said. "So we're just getting to know one another. Does that make anymore sense?"</p> <p>She nodded with a smile.</p> <p>"What's the real reason for this trip this year?" he asked. "I mean, have you been thinking about me?"</p> <p>He frowned and her smile disappeared.</p> <p>"I...um...no..."</p> <p>"That's what it's like to be thinking about a guy with that sort of a fetish," he said. "You know what I mean?"</p> <p>She reached around her back and unclasped her bra quickly. Chris's eyes moved from the mirror to the breasts before he looked her in the face again.</p> <p>"I've been thinking about you," she said.</p> <p>"Mmm, I know all about it, too," he said with a nod. "And this morning. That's all I want to do."</p> <p>"I see..." she said. "Is that it?"</p> <p>"No more..." he said.</p> <p>"We'll talk more about it in a few minutes."</p> <p>He turned his focus back to her breasts in particular now that they were completely free. She felt something hard under her skirt and moved her hand to cup her left breast.</p> <p>"Chris..." she said softly as she felt him. "I like your fingers on my breast."</p> <p>"Mmm hmm," he said, squeezing her breast tightly. "I like that."</p> <p>"We have to finish getting ready for work tomorrow," she said with a shy smile. "I'm not going to be able to do today's assignment."</p> <p>"I've got to work late tomorrow anyway. I just need to get to sleep."</p> <p>"Okay." It's been another twenty minutes before she could even think the words out without becoming embarrassed.</p> <p>They stood up to leave. Chris had his arm around her waist and had turned her around on to his lap. For one of the few, few moments only they'd been apart.</p> <p>"Chris?" she said after they had walked out.</p> <p>"Yes?" he asked.</p> <p>"I'm going to bed. You can help with the laundry tomorrow."</p> <p>Chris turned to his suitcase in the entryway of his home.</p> <p>"I could use a cup of coffee now," he said.</p> <p>"No, please," she said. "I'm feeling so horny all this day, I'm thinking about what you're doing...and...I'm horny myself."</p> <p>As she walked to the house she could feel his hardness pushing into her.</p> <p>***********</p> <p>"It's not a long drive to the coffee shop, is it?" she asked.</p> <p>"It's okay with me. And we have enough time for each other," he said. "It's not like you're going to be spending the day at work at home. That's all right."</p> <p>Chris turned on his heel and walked slowly into the kitchenâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
