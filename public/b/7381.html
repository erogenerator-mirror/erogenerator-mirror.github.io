"Why the delay? Is that why you're out with your husband?" Leaning forward, she reached over and touched his arm, then leaned his head back with a little laugh.</p> <p>"No, I'm not out with any other man. I'll just watch my wife for a while." She closed her eyes again and took a deep breath, then leaned over again.</p> <p>"Why did you let that happen?" he asked, his voice slightly breathless. She felt his breath on her, just before her nipples hardened, pressing against the thin fabric of her t-shirt. She closed her eyes and smiled, then opened them again.</p> <p>"Hm, what is it?"</p> <p>"I just want to see you again."</p> <p>He leaned back and laughed, then reached down to unfasten his pants.</p> <p>"Hm, but that wouldn't be the best thing for the both of us to do."</p> <p>"You don't really think there is anything we won't do for each other?" she asked. His eyebrows went up at her.</p> <p>"Hm, I think that you might just want to watch some new things, after all. I've always liked the game."</p> <p>She smiled, then reached up to his face. He leaned back on the couch, and she crawled down, until she was kneeling before him.</p> <p>"I want to make you cum for me again," she told him. Her voice was breathless, almost as though she was a little afraid. He reached for her and lifted her chin, pressing her closer to him. His tongue came out, and when she parted her lips slightly, it traced circles around them both, then she moved her head back and opened her mouth wider to let his tongue in. She felt his hand on her cheek as he pulled her face forward. She opened her eyes and he kissed her, softly at first. She responded in kind, opening her mouth and letting his tongue enter. He felt her hand behind his head, holding his face to hers so that her fingers could explore his hair. Her tongue caressed his tongue as he kissed. Their kiss intensified, as his hand wandered down to her hip and began pulling her skirt up.</p> <p>Leaning back again, she looked at him. She liked looking at him, especially in a semi-professional sort of way. He looked so young and inexperienced, she thought, and she couldn't get over how good he looked. She'd been wondering about him, about his body, and what it might be like to lay with him. But he was young, and so inexperienced. He was so inexperienced!</p> <p>"Take your shirt off," she said in an almost dreamy voice.</p> <p>He nodded with understanding as he started to undo the buttons. She reached up and began to slowly stroke him, feeling and stroking it as she pulled down on his shirt. He pulled it off his shoulders, and felt the straps of her bra drop as he tossed it onto the couch. They were standing now, touching together. She leaned back on the couch, allowing him to slip off her shirt. He was looking at her breasts, then down at them, and she ran a finger over them, teasing his nipples in turn.</p> <p>"What do you think, would you like to see my breasts, David?"</p> <p>He reached around her chest, then cupped one in his hand. She felt the heat on her other breast as he ran his finger over her nipple and then up again. His finger brushed across it, and she thought she was going to go crazy.</p> <p>"Do you like what you see?"</p> <p>"Your tits, Lea."</p> <p>"I did something just before we left the cabin. I rubbed on the bar," she said, looking around. "And I have other places to be." She felt him looking at her breasts as she undid her belt.</p> <p>"I know someone," she told him before she reached for the button and zipper of his jeans. She unbuttoned his jeans, pulled them down, then took a step out of them. She saw the outline of his erection in the front of his briefs, and she was fascinated with it. He had shaved the hair around his cock and ball off, but she didn't know just how long he was. They weren't fully erect, she noticed, but she couldn't wait to see him naked. The sight of it seemed to excite her all the more than she thought fair. She leaned down a little, letting his cock push down her top, and then pulled a little farther, so that she could slide it inside her shirt. She watched him as she lifted his head and kissed him all over again. Their tongues slid around in each other's mouths.</p> <p>One hand was holding the back of her head, theâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
