She looked like a goddess with her long dark hair falling over her shoulders framing her large eyes and the perfect set of ruby lips.</p> <p>She finished by turning her back towards me and then turning her over, and putting both her hands on my face.</p> <p>“I wanted you, I wanted to share you with someone else and I’ve wanted to ask you to share me with your parents forever.”</p> <p>She looked away for a moment and then spoke. “I'm not sure if I’m ready to do that right now.”</p> <p>She turned onto her back and spread her legs. She leaned forwards and I buried my mouth into her.</p> <p>Her sex was completely smooth and warm, and I tasted the saltiness of her juices. This was the most wonderful, and I licked and sucked her until she began to beg me to stop.</p> <p>She opened her eyes and looked at me, and as she opened them, I looked into her brown eyes. They were filled with love as they looked back at me.</p> <p>She kissed me and we started kissing and kissing until she was moaning softly. Her hands cupped my face, and I had no idea how to hold my tongue. She pulled it away from her lips and then licked it. She kissed and bit my ears and licked my neck while her hands went up and massaged my chest.</p> <p>I felt her hand squeeze around my cock until her grip was tighter. She held me tight as she slipped one hand down and started massaging my balls while her other hand slid up and down my shaft.</p> <p>I pulled her head back and she kissed my belly and my balls. Then she leaned back to kiss the base of my cock. I let out a gasp as her tongue made contact with it and she slid her tongue around.</p> <p>“You know I can make you feel different, don’t you, baby?” she asked me.</p> <p>Her head came up and she looked down at me with her green-blue eyes. I could see the lust in those eyes and I knew I was going to have Amber at my command and in her bed as soon as I could.</p> <p>“Yes, baby,” she said softly. “I know you like that.”</p> <p>She looked up at me again, her green eyes shining with happiness. She was a Goddess.</p> <p>Her mouth left my cock and she kissed me again. Then she started to kiss and nibble on my neck again.</p> <p>Again she kissed, but I could feel her tongue and mine slipping into each other's mouths together.</p> <p>It was as if she had an electric connection to me and when we came to each other and her mouth found mine our eyes were just inches apart.</p> <p>I wanted to touch her, but my hands went to her back, caressing her as I kissed her.</p> <p>She pulled away and held me up.</p> <p>“We have to, baby,” she said to me. “Your parents will worry. They might send somebody. I’ll have to go and meet some clients.”</p> <p>She stepped back and then led me over to the bed.</p> <p>I looked at her as we climbed onto it. She pulled me down to her and kissed me while she held me up. I started to kiss her neck and I began to kiss her nipples as they began to ache. Slowly, I kissed my way down her stomach as my hands continued to caress her body. They went over her flat stomach. I kissed and nibbled my way down between her legs until I reached the thin fabric of her panties. I slid my hands over the fabric and then I began to kiss and lick the panties.</p> <p>She pushed my face down further as my hands were still caressing her.</p> <p>I kissed her inner thigh as she continued to push my face closer to her warm, moist sex. I kissed along the seam of her panties and then pulled them downward and as I lifted my hands up I pulled them over her legs. Her panties were soaked as they fell off.</p> <p>I ran kisses down her thigh. When I reached her knee I kissed it and her thigh as I lowered my head on her soft thigh. I began sucking and kissing the inner thigh.</p> <p>She pulled the panties away from her, and the smell of her perfume filled the room. I sucked the panties between my lips and she closed her legs tightly behind my head and pulled me on again.</p> <p>I lowered my mouth to her outer thigh and I kissed and nibbled the inside of her knee as my hands caressed her body.</p> <p>She reached up—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
