She went to the gym more than once a week.</p> <p>At first she was happy that her stomach was getting better. But soon her stomach started getting worse and her ass started making it more bearable. Then in 2 years of working out, her ass and back had become more and more muscular, and as a result were showing signs of stretching out.</p> <p>Then one day her doctor told her to change her diet.</p> <p>The doctor said she needed a little energy boost and a healthy diet, and wanted her to workout as much as she could. She did everything she could to lose weight, and after two weeks started exercising as much as she could, but she knew it wouldn't help her and was still hurting too much to stay fit.</p> <p>She found a good bar with all the equipment available by the weekdays and started making a habit to eat that stuff out of the refrigerator, while at night she tried to get some and lose the weight. But eventually she found her body had gone a little faster than before. Her waistline was now back up again, and her nipples started to harden. She never realized that she had such a beautiful stomach.</p> <p>It wasn't until the next week that something changed, and her appetite for more and less food really started to have an effect. Her appetite was no longer so high.</p> <p>That weekend was her first workout before her return to the gym. She loved it. It seemed so easy, and it felt just like she used to. She couldn't believe it when she left the gym in the early to be a lesbian, and her only goal was to make sure she didn't eat anything on her vacation.</p> <p>There wasn't a way.</p> <p>She didn't want to go through that again. Even though it was a step back.</p> <p>She went home to spend the whole weekend going through her routine.</p> <p>At the end of every week it started getting better. She was back to her old energy, now eating more and better, exercising more and more, and she wasn't afraid that she would become fat.</p> <p>She couldn't wait.</p> <p>She looked at her body.</p> <p>Her breasts, the perfect little globes, her waistline, her legs, her pussy lips, her ass, and finally her bottom. She had the body of a teenage girl. She felt strong and confident. She felt beautiful. She liked what she considered her greatest asset. Her body was strong, and her body fit perfectly. It was so different from anyone else. Not only physically, but emotionally too. She felt that she was a desirable beauty, and that it drove her to try and go with the flow.</p> <p>That first time she really lost control and enjoyed being made love to by a man, and even more by her best friend.</p> <p>She was amazed at how easily she could control the energy level of her body. She didn't even want to think about how to make up for it.</p> <p>They had talked about things they'd be doing for hours, and both wanted it to be a success. Of course she had a hard time resisting.</p> <p>"We can't," she said, "we're not lesbians!"</p> <p>A week later, her stomach was still full and she had no trouble making it go down.</p> <p>The day before her return, her trainer, Josh, arrived. He was the biggest guy she'd ever been with, and she had a feeling that there were many more who lived down the street from her.</p> <p>When Josh had gotten her changed, she took one of his arms, got a couple of pills laced with the alcohol cocktail inside and handed him a glass. "I want you to feel what it feels like to just lay here and take a drink, but let me know if you're still feeling sick."</p> <p>The first sip seemed to do it. It was more of a kick than anything else. It gave her a new sense of power and independence. She'd never felt like this about herself before.</p> <p>She took his arm, and slowly followed Josh's eyes while he drank the drink. She followed his gaze as a person walking into the room. She felt a power and attraction from her in their eyes.</p> <p>Her hands got heavier and heavier.</p> <p>"You're a girl," they say.</p> <p>"I am," she says before letting go of him completely.</p> <p>He looks like a man after she's finished drinking the drink. He looks kind of drunk.</p> <p>She had a feeling that she was going to enjoy herself soon.</p> <p>Josh took a little more himself and held on to her elbow. "Where have you been?"</p> <p>"I couldn't find a better way to start the next 3 weeks," she said as sheâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
