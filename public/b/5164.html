'Keep going until I come, or I'm going to blow you, if that's what you want?'</p> <p>He grinned at me. 'But of course I'll come!'</p> <p>'Good!' I grinned. 'Take me from behind, please!'</p> <p>'But you didn't come!' he asked, pointing to the big stain on his groin.</p> <p>'I do,' I said. 'And I'm used to it.'</p> <p>As much as it pleased him to watch me masturbate for him, to see me so helpless for a moment, and to hear it so raw and urgent made me horny beyond belief.</p> <p>He had a big, hairy, muscular erection which pointed straight up to the ceiling. It looked much bigger than what I'd been used to when I'd masturbated in the bath with him, or in his bed, or even with him outside. I couldn't resist reaching forward to stroke it, feeling it jump in my hand.</p> <p>He moved backwards from me, bending forward a little, and started pumping his cock back and forth.</p> <p>'I always wondered what you'd feel like after coming,' I murmured. 'Is that the idea of being able to go again, and again?'</p> <p>He shrugged. 'Well, it'd be nice for me to see it.'</p> <p>I moved slowly backwards until I was resting against the doorway. I looked back into his bedroom. He was lying on the bed, lying astride his belly on the mattress. The condom was rolled down his cock and a glistening drop of semen was sticking from it. I reached out and started stroking him, feeling the shaft and testicles move under me as he fucked me, his large body sliding up and down in perfect synchronisation with my own hips and his hands, which were working me frantically.</p> <p>But there was a problem.</p> <p>'It's not going in,' I told myself.</p> <p>I was still masturbating him until I could feel his body start to tensing and then I heard a groan, an exhalation, and a long, low moan of pleasure as he pumped his semen deeply into me.</p> <p>Then he was on his back again, propped up by pillows and pillows and, although I was still coming down, he didn't get up.</p> <p>'I'll make you a cup of tea,' he said. 'Would you like one?'</p> <p>I reached down. 'Go on,' I replied. 'I'll get it for you.'</p> <p>He was already gone and I was on my back on the bed, lying prone on my bed, splayed out in front of me, my breasts squashed together and my pussy swollen with excitement. I watched him, fascinated, as he came across and started kissing my tits slowly, lingering just long enough for him to run his tongue over my nipples, gently pushing them into the air, as he cupped my breast and caressed my swollen areola. It was beautiful.</p> <p>I was close to coming and I told him so.</p> <p>'Do you want me to finish you off?' he asked.</p> <p>I could, of course, now. 'Yes - yes, please!'</p> <p>He did, and his big, strong hand took hold of the still-erect shaft of his penis and, like a porn star, he slid it gently in and out of my pussy, slowly but firmly - slowly, but surely, as he told me his name.</p> <p>He'd told me about sucking someone's cock and having two or more in me - but I'd never known one to do that. It was wonderful. I'd never really thought about fucking someone before but now I was - and the feeling of his tongue on me and feeling as it swirled around my clitoris and on my slit - it almost made me come then. I'd cum again, and I was enjoying it as much as he was.</p> <p>'Do you mind if I give you two more?' he asked me as I felt myself going off again.</p> <p>'Of course not,' I replied. 'I love you."</p> <p>He pulled me backwards until he was on his back, my legs either side of him, his cock sliding in and out of my slowly, gently, easily now.</p> <p>'Would you like to fuck me?' he asked me.</p> <p>'Not right now, darling' I answered and he smiled.</p> <p>'It's okay,' I added, 'I just want to finish myself off. I want to feel you in me.'</p> <p>He started playing with both of my nipples again, slowly and firmly, his fingers caressing round to gently squeeze the nipples. I was near a climax, I knew, and then he asked me if I really could holdâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
