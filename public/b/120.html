He smiled as he remembered hearing his wife saying that to him on Monday when they were in bed after the wedding. He'd been amazed at how different their sex was from it had been. This evening was very different - the sounds and smells were different somehow, and the feelings and sensations in the room felt just as good. He wanted more with his wife so badly his cock throbbed and began to twitch.</p> <p>"Come here," she said as she reached out to him, pulling him to her. He looked up at her, his cock throbbing and twitching. She smiled at him and licked her lips. "Mmmm ... my husband should be fucking you good right now," she purred. He gasped at the erotic implications. As they kissed his hand reached for hers and he grabbed and squeezed it eagerly. She moaned into his mouth as her mouth clamped tight around his. His own breathing increased, his hips started pumping forward at the touch of her tongue. She pulled back and looked into his eyes as she began to slide the finger from her mouth, slowly at first, and then more firmly.</p> <p>"Shit!" he sighed as his hips lifted off the bed and pushed into her hand. "Cum for me, big boy," she whispered against his lips.</p> <p>A flash of white light appeared. He looked down to see that she'd slipped her index finger fully into his ass. "Shit," he moaned again, his hips jerking away as the wave continued to flow through his body. She laughed as it subsided. Her lips were smeared with the residue of their kiss. She kissed the top of his head as he drifted down to his body. "You really are delicious, and you deserve to be well fucked," she said.</p> <p>"You're crazy, Sarah," he moaned as his cock flexed into its full length again. "Ohhh ..."</p> <p>A small sound came from her. He looked down and saw her smiling. Their lips parted. She was still straddling his hips as he lay back, their faces level with his rigid cock.</p> <p>"I want to suck your cock, then," she said, slowly rolling her hips. "But that's not possible, baby." He looked down and saw his cock was still between her legs. "Go on," her voice whispered as she bent her hips towards it. He leaned up onto his elbows, the tip of his cock nudging open her labia and rubbing along her wet pussy lips. He felt her legs opening, and then his cock plunged into her pussy, slowly. As she moaned she continued to moan, her mouth opening slightly to scream with pleasure. He began to fuck her gently and she raised her hips to meet his each time his cock filled her as it went deeper and deeper.</p> <p>"You really are an incredible lover," she moaned as they began to thrust in unison.</p> <p>"That you did," he grunted as he began to pump his hips, lifting her hips with each thrust. "And you have the most incredible tight pussy," he said as he saw how he was stretching her with his cock. They ground together as he thrust hard and fast into her. He leaned his head back, looking into Sarah's eyes, knowing that the pleasure of their coupling was building inside of her. He felt her body stiffen and moan deeply as she came again and again. His own cock felt as hard as his body as it rammed into her. She began to shake, pulling him tightly with her thighs. He felt the muscles of her legs contracting as she came around his cock. She stopped moving at the sight of his face, his expression, and his cock continuing to thrust in and out of her. He saw her eyes as she saw him. He could see the passion in the expression on her face. Her body trembled as she came, then began to slump on top of his body. He rolled them over, gently, his arms around her waist, his cock still in her.</p> <p>"How do you feel?" he asked as he kissed her neck. He could still not believe what he had just experienced. Sarah smiled and laughed.</p> <p>"A little tense," she whispered, her eyes still sparkling. "It just ... felt ... amazing," she added, "but ... we really need to finish."</p> <p>"I agree," he said as he pulled his cock out of her. "Just as well we didn't have to hold off. I didn't tell you what I wantedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
