We'd been in our early 80's when our little adventure had gone too far. There was something wrong with the woman I loved: she had an attitude of "If you don't want to do it you will", and although I had no more desire to have sex with her or even have sexual relations with her, she had never once made me come. This might seem bad but she never once gave my cock the finger, "And don't ask for one; get it in your hand - I've done that." That was the problem. It was always one of the worst, and for no reason at all. I hated it.</p> <p>There was one small one in fact: for a couple of years afterwards after sex we took a couple of months off from each other for our honeymoon. We were both working and weren't as fit, so that was what the hotel pool had been for dinner and dancing a couple of times. But we didn't care, not just because of what the other said we seemed to have gone a little too far. In fact, we were more than a little turned on because we just talked; but to tell the truth the men and women who were there made no attempt to stop us, just enjoyed what we had done to ourselves.</p> <p>We did find some of our friends there for the occasional party or party - that was fine and all. There was a local bar there that had its own dance floor which was open on a Friday night, and if someone was dancing and were dancing it was an interesting party. The women in the bar were hot, and I don't think she had an affair because for a while it seemed just the way she was and it wasn't even as bad as when she was at my beck and call. But one particular night at the party it got out of hand. We were at a bit of trouble and ended up at a strip bar, well off from most of the other bar patrons, and just a bit more than a hundred people inside. I don't think I ever got so wet when dancing to anyone else, just that I never stopped it: a couple of the men there had seen everything, but they didn't seem to like it, or think anything about it and simply ignored us. I told them it wasn't that we were trying to steal the night away - and not to worry; it was just sort of a dance to try to look respectable and get into the mood or a night to remember. I guess things may have looked different to me for a while then, but in those days it was more like we'd started a new relationship and that I was now living with a different lover, rather than a married one. There was not much to talk about: our drinks were almost up, and when that bar was full it was like it had been ages since we had danced together. We sat down in the back room and we just talked a lot. But we never got around to the whole dance thing as in all those years apart when I would talk to her she was the one looking pretty and doing well. There was a few girls there - she didn't wear that all the time. She even got me to dance with her during a slow song and she didn't get shy about it. But I couldn't stop her - she made me feel wanted again and she didn't even feel the way I did before.</p> <p>But then one evening she had come home that night and she looked really pretty and I couldn't stop looking at her when I came home that night. She went into the bathroom and got out my bathrobe and she came back into the bedroom and sat on the bed saying she had a headache. She came back to bed, took off her robe, climbed on the bed next to me and said she didn't feel good, and I told her no headache, so she said she didn't feel too good and so I rolled over so I could get up. We held each other tightly for a moment, and she looked really good - and I didn't want to break that hold, and I pulled the bed sheets over us.</p> <p>I don't think I had ever known her feel so secure as she did that night, until then, but our last night in bed, we kept it even. We talked about everything, even about my cheating and what it was like. And we didn't talk about our new love affair - that had probably changed when I got married, for what it was, but we still talked about what was in me back then, I really am sure. We just held each other tighter than we usually did and didn't try to look away or anything. We talked about our love life, and she told me she often felt guilty thinking that she loved me like that, and that it made her feel guilty for what she saw asâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
