She patted my behind.</p> <p>"Thanks." I replied. Then I felt her fingers slide over my hip, across my buttocks, and up underneath.</p> <p>"Mmmm." She pulled me to her, and she kissed my neck, making my back arch.</p> <p>"Do you want more of this?" She asked, gently pushing her tongue into my ear, licking the beads of sweat from it. I could feel her wet hot breath on my neck, tickling my ear...</p> <p>"O yes."</p> <p>Her hand slid down my waist, under my thong, and rested across my sex, which was sopping wet, and she squeezed me, sliding her other hand over my hip, along the top of my thighs, until she could push my thong down. I felt how slippery I was; it was wonderful.</p> <p>I felt her fingers press against me, and then she was inside me. She slid two fingers inside me, and I felt the walls of her vagina wrap around them. I'm not sure I'd ever been so wet. She thrust into me repeatedly, with the fingers of her other hand, as I gripped the sheets again in total satisfaction. The sensation, just as she'd promised earlier, was indescribable.</p> <p>I could do nothing but hold on for a moment, and then I felt her body shift, sliding away from me. I turned over onto my back, looking up into her face. She looked at me with those deep grey eyes. I was completely out of control, and I could feel the heat of her. She sat up, and pushed me back down onto the bed. She pushed me toward her again, and I found myself face to face with her in a new position. Her fingers caressed my face, as she looked at me as though she'd known, yet still looked down at me. I pulled her face toward mine, and she leaned in and kissed me. She kissed me as though it were the only thing she'd tasted for a long, long time. Her hand moved down my body, and she slipped her fingers inside my thong. She touched my pussy as her fingers explored it gently, and I felt her wetness and mine, which had become slick with my perspiration.</p> <p>As she touched my clit softly, she slid two fingers inside of me, feeling how incredibly wet I was. I cried softly, as she slid them into me, until they were completely buried inside of me. She lifted her hand up, letting me watch as she fingered me gently. I closed my eyes, and I felt her fingers on my clitoris, circling it back and forth as she rubbed over it over and over in a circular motion. "Oh god," escaped me as my knees began to tremble. "Do it." She coaxed me, keeping me pinned down on the bed, while she continued to rub my clit, the pleasure building slowly. I felt a climax rising inside of me, as she continued to caress my clit, I lost all thoughts of my lover as I felt her fingers pushing into my pussy, inside of me. Her own wet orgasm pulsed through my body like no orgasm I'd ever felt before. With her fingers deep inside of me, I could feel how my lover was pulsating against my pussy walls, as she kept fingering me in her own orgasm. As I began to descend into my own pleasure, she slid her fingers out, and began to rub her finger across my anus, rubbing it gently. My hands went to my breasts, and I began to caress them gently. It felt so incredibly sensual to have those fingers rubbing across my anus, and, I felt a flood of happiness flowing up and down my legs. I'm not sure exactly how many times I came, or how many times my body actually shook, but I felt as though I never stopped experiencing pleasure, and I loved it.</p> <p>I laid there trying to catch my breath as she slid her finger up my anal passage. I was trying to stay still, but my thighs were shaking so much that my muscles began to tingle. "Are you coming yet?" She asked. She was teasing me. I wanted to be able to come in her so badly, but was paralyzed with the need not to.</p> <p>"No."</p> <p>I thought she was going to stop, but I was wrong. I shook again: in pain like a leaf. She pulled out, and got off the bed, smiling at me. "Sorry," she said, as I lay there, feeling a mixture of pain from my anus, and pleasure as she pulled on my skirt. She walked away, and I heard the front door lock. "What's wrong, babe?"</p> <p>I sat up against the headboard, and let my hand fall to my lap. It felt so weird to be doing something so dirtyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
