This place was amazing. It looked out of this world. The pool was a massive area with a large chaise lounge at the far end. The house looked absolutely amazing as it glowed with lights as the wind carried in light from the moon which seemed floating in front of the house.</p> <p>She turned a corner and saw it too. It was a nice private pool. It was surrounded by big bushes and the large back fence that separated it from the property was built with vines and the fence ran up to a small waterfall. The pool was huge and covered with a blue stone slab, it looked to be built as if it was the deepest water of the world. She walked over to it and turned on the waterfall. At the end was a large pool and there were two hot tubs at the side. Sarah had never been there and she knew that there was no real privacy in there. That was part of the reason that she bought this place. There were no towels in the bathrooms, it was just a large communal room and she always used towels to help herself to her room.</p> <p>Sarah knew that she wouldn't be able to get out of there on her own for quite awhile, and she didn't want to make a mess on the floor since that would be too messy or she could get messy. Besides, that was the one thing that never failed to arouse her to no end.</p> <p>She walked out onto the patio and she saw a gorgeous guy that was walking towards her. She walked up to him and said, "Hi."</p> <p>"Do you have time for a drink?" he asked.</p> <p>Sarah responded, "Sure. Are you in an alcohol induced stupor?"</p> <p>"No, what the hell am I supposed to do?" he asked.</p> <p>She walked over and sat on the large, over-stuffed lounge chair. She reached up and took his hand and said, "We're here to relax, it's time to unwind."</p> <p>She put her arms around him and kissed his neck, her tongue tracing his skin as her lips pressed into his, she pushed against his body. She whispered in his ear, "If you want me to be your next lover, you'll have to do what it takes."</p> <p>"I'd love to," he said and immediately fell to his knees to unbutton her bikini top. She held onto his head, as he pulled out of her pool and began to rub his hands over her body. Her breasts were heaving, she was breathing so hard, her nipples were standing out even more against her suit.</p> <p>"Oh God," she moaned as his fingers teased on her nipples.</p> <p>"This is really making me horny," she said breathing hard and rubbing her palms over his hair. He lowered her suit until her breasts were bare and he was looking at their size and firmness, and then he pulled her into his arms and kissed her deeply as he squeezed her ass. With his mouth open she ran her fingers through his hair as he knelt to take her nipple between his teeth and begin to nibble and suck. He slipped into a new level and began to suck her nipple as he squeezed the other one in between finger and thumb. It was so warm and tight and he felt so good.</p> <p>Sarah felt so good that she let him go on and on for a while and then she had to take his hand and get him to stand and kiss her again. She looked into his eyes and took his hand and laid him back on one of the chairs. They stood kissing and touching as they rubbed each others bodies. She could feel his erect cock pressing against her leg. He put his hands under her shirt and then pulled it over her head and threw it to the side. She turned around and took his cock in his hand and held it for him as the kiss deepened, and then he moved in her arms. She kissed him hard, pulling both of his erect nipples into her mouth. His hands found her ass and cupped it as they rubbed against each other. They were both so turned on. They had wanted each other to be in such a way, but this was different. They had seen each other naked countless times and they wanted each other so badly.</p> <p>Just when she had wanted to get into the mood and start making out, she couldn't resist. She pushed him in the sofa and leaned into him, sliding her legs around his waist as he held onto her ass. He knew what was coming and he didn't care, it was going to be fun. His hands rubbed up and down her back as he began to kiss her neck and ear. Her arms were around his neck and she could feel his cock pressing against herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
