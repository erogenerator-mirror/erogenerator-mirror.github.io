It was like a sex scene straight out of a porno film. They both liked it. After they were done, he laid next to her and began to kiss her on the neck and ear. His hand moved down and cupped her big breasts. He rubbed her hard tanned nipples. She was a little turned on as the big wet spot on her panties began to grow. He reached down and she felt his thick hard cock pressing against her. As his hand began to work its way up her thigh, she broke his kiss and began to softly moan. His hand began to work her panties down and over her hairy pussy, and gently pressed against her labia. "I need you," she cried as his fingers entered her.</p> <p>The two of them lay there while the passion of the moment built and she began to get turned on. She pushed into his hand and began to buck her hips into his hand as he kissed her neck and ear. His fingers felt good up her. When he had brought her to orgasm, she pulled his face to hers and she had to kiss his mouth and mouth. After one last kiss, she pushed him onto his back. She climbed on top after he had gotten his cock hard. She lay on top of him and began to fuck. She was a wild girl. Her long, shapely legs wrapped around his body and locked into position so he could feel everything and do them his way. She kept moving until he too had an orgasm. He slid out of her as she fell on his chest. She didn't move as he held her and just caressed her and she didn't stop him.

When he finally raised his head to look at her he could see his cock was starting to grow once more.</p> <p>"I need you now," she said as he slid upward. She wrapped her arms and legs around his body and began to ride him. He was not about to ask her to stop, but he knew that she could tell by his groan and the way he was breathing. Her breasts seemed to be bouncing as he fucked her. He was feeling her pussy get hotter and hotter as the ride got hotter and hotter. His balls ached as they were drawn up into his cock.</p> <p>"Yes! Oh yes! Oh yes!" she moaned as she felt her own climax starting. She moved her hips down taking his cock in deep and she came with a yell. With him now moaning and holding his head against her chest as her body went from tingling to euphoria, she fell on top of him with his cock still trapped inside of her.</p> <p>They lay there for awhile, recovering from what they had just done. After they had kissed and lain there, he finally lifted her hips and got up on his knees. He leaned down and kissed her. "Are you ready to stay tonight?" he asked her.</p> <p>"Yes," she moaned. "It'll be a surprise and I'm afraid that now we'd be late."</p> <p>"Oh, you wouldn't," he laughed.
