"And you?"</p> <p>"What did you just say?" I responded.</p> <p>"That, uh... 'that 'that' you're feeling pretty good about the whole place, 'cause it seems like you did a pretty good job."</p> <p>"Yeah, I've given the place a healthy amount of attention just about everything here and..."</p> <p>"Do you mean the whole place? Are everyone in here, then?"</p> <p>"I think that's it. I guess you could call it something else."</p> <p>"What'd you mean?"</p> <p>"Nothing 'nothing' really," Heather said, putting her hand up. "Like in, 'The House' itself."</p> <p>I could be there if I wanted to be! I'd have my fun with the guys, too. It wasn't a big deal, not really, but it had a point! And just so you knew, I was totally in the group here.</p> <p>"Yeah, definitely the whole place," I said.</p> <p>"And you know I'm not...?" Heather asked.</p> <p>"I'm not too sure I'd like you, but I do know I'd like you!"</p> <p>"That's the thing, I don't even know whether to be nervous or proud, but it's the truth!" I chuckled.</p> <p>"Okay, I get your point," Heather said. "What are the rules? I didn't go in your head."</p> <p>"Ah. Well, like it or not. Everyone here is the same age. But I guess you could say there's that kind of thing. And then some of the other guys are... different?"</p> <p>"Like, you can say same age and have the same sexual orientation, though. You could even have been bi or something."</p> <p>"Yeah... the other guys, I guess, but I still don't get it. I mean, I can't quite get it!"</p> <p>"Well, I do. So, do you?"</p> <p>"Hmm.... it depends," Heather said. "Do you get what I mean?"</p> <p>"I guess I'm going to have to change the rules a bit."</p> <p>"Well, I want to try."</p> <p>I hesitated for a second, then thought about that. I didn't have a lot of experience with this, but we were going to find out!</p> <p>"Sure, I'll come," I said.</p> <p>"Really? I mean, do you know your first rule?"</p> <p>And so I did.</p> <p>"No, not really," I replied. "No 'no' here. It's just... I don't have a 'no'. Like, 'I'm going too', 'I don't want too,'"</p> <p>"Come on, you know I don't have to say it," Heather said.</p> <p>"No, seriously, I have to," I replied.</p> <p>"Well, if my first rule... is something you're okay with, then, and I mean it, then..."</p> <p>"Yeah."</p> <p>"And it doesn't have to be my first," Heather added.</p> <p>And so we had a great time. We had fun, really, just like I had fun with the guys, too. We played a game, though, and we'd made pretty good time. I had no clue I was going to end up with a major hangover. Heather and I got along really well. I wasn't going to tell her we'd done anything with anyone, much less that I was going home to fuck her.</p> <p>"I don't really know," I said, "who started it. Why do I have a big hangover?"</p> <p>"No one knows," Heather replied. "Just like you were going to tell me. I was just thinking that if you wanted to try things with someone else, you'd probably tell them."</p> <p>"Okay, I guess I can do that."</p> <p>"So, who'd you meet?" Heather asked.</p> <p>"Nope," I replied. "What does everyone else know?"</p> <p>"Well, that's just it," Heather said. "And everyone here knows someone else, right?"</p> <p>"Right," I said. "So, it's more important now than even having a rule?"</p> <p>"Right!" Heather said.</p> <p>"So, what's this rule? You said I'm gonna be your first," I said.</p> <p>"Oh, right. I didn't even mention it yet, but..."</p> <p>"Right, right. Right, right, right!"</p> <p>"Okay. So, do you want a rule?"</p> <p>"Sure, if you want."</p> <p>"Oh, yeah. Of course I do! I mean, it's a rule! I'm just kidding you!"</p> <p>"No, it's really okayâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
