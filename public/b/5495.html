This was a little different but the feeling was amazing.</p> <p>She started thrusting against me as she moaned out loud.</p> <p>"Oh! Oh! Oh!!"</p> <p>My other hand reached up and played with her breast. I gently massaged her nipple and she moaned again. I then slowly moved my hand up and down.</p> <p>"Mmm mmm?" she murmured.</p> <p>I gently teased her with my fingers, slowly massaging up and down.</p> <p>My cock was starting to swell.</p> <p>"Does this feel good?" I asked.</p> <p>"Oh yeah."</p> <p>"Your pussy is so hot."</p> <p>"Mmmmmm."</p> <p>My fingers sped up.</p> <p>"Cum for me!"</p> <p>She moaned.</p> <p>"Yes!"</p> <p>I sped up again, then slowed down again. I knew she was close to cumming.</p> <p>"Ohh... mmm... Ahh... ah... ohh! OH! OH! OH!"</p> <p>Her pussy clenched on my fingers as she came hard.</p> <p>I watched as her legs shook under her and she let out another loud moan. I kept my fingers still and pressed them up into her as she began to come down.</p> <p>That's when it happened. My cock hardened again. I slowly pulled my fingers out and they instantly started to jerk up and down as my hips thrust in and out.</p> <p>"Mmmmmm."</p> <p>"Oh wow! Oh wow! Ahh! Uh!"</p> <p>I kept thrusting, slowly building up my pace even as my fingers worked up and down over her clit.</p> <p>"Oh god! I am cumming! I am almost there! I am nearly there!" she screamed then gasped and grabbed my hand.</p> <p>I kept thrusting and her hand found her wetness. I kept thrusting for a while until she stopped coming down on me.</p> <p>"Did I do that," she said as I let her hand go.</p> <p>"You did it. Very good."</p> <p>"That was the most amazing job I have ever done," she said. Then asked, "You really are good at that."</p> <p>I gave her a big kiss and then said, "I am still very talented at this."</p> <p>"I am good with my hands and in certain areas. I just got my first real orgasm of the day." She said.</p> <p>Then I said, "I love to do this to you."</p> <p>We kissed for a while. Then she gave me a kiss and then turned. I started to pick up her clothes and stuff. I started to pick up the book that she had on the shelf so I could give it to her. We got dressed and made our way home after exchanging a very good morning embrace and a very passionate kiss.</p> <p>I woke up a very early morning and was thinking about my weekend and my new experience. I was surprised at myself.</p> <p>My cock was starting to hurt. Then I started thinking about how well she had cum. Then thinking about where I had been before. Then getting on with the business.</p> <p>But first, I had to call Melissa and tell her why I was going out. She would love to tell me what had happened. She would never believe it if I said some weird shit to her.</p> <p>Then I thought about my new relationship with my friend. I had gotten to know her. She was not jealous of my relationship, I had not been. She is so nice. Even she was kind of sweet to me.</p> <p>She was also a nice person. I had not liked her in any way.</p> <p>Now I knew what was in store for me.</p> <p>Then what happened nextâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
