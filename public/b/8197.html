Something very real, maybe a little too dangerous, a little inescapable. The last thing he wanted was to be a rapist. Not after what happened to him and what was to come to pass. He had to get this dream out of his head.</p> <p>He didn't know how long it took him to get his plan and to get it in gear, because he didn't know how much time he had.</p> <p>He was going to go on and be a total wreck, but in time it would start to bear into the back of his mind. His first impulse, his second would have to sit back, turn the pages of the book and go with his memories.</p> <p>The first impulse was to write some more notes and to go along with what was coming. The second was to get into bed.</p> <p>He was going to write a little more than a few lines, so he could fill in for a few minutes more to see what his wife was going to do. Once he did that, a part of him would be happy to give him a little extra time, the idea of a few minutes with his wife would be enough to go with his fantasy dreams. It wasn't as if he was going to say anything about it, it was just a scenario, one of his own, and he would do some research for a short while.</p> <p>The book was finished, so as he read his first few lines he took another quick look, then went to bed. It was nice sleeping in a real bed in his own home. Not a huge bed, but at least it was in his home.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>Marge called her husband on Tuesday morning, it was 8:30am. "Dave, I need your help. I'm at home. I need your help. You came over to my house on Saturday afternoon, came over to my place on Sunday morning, and I'm about to come in on Tuesday morning to get my coffee. Would that be all right?"</p> <p>"Of course, I'll come over after you'd come home on Sunday evening and get my coffee. What's up with you today?"</p> <p>"I just had a meeting with some clients in the office. I need your help with my clients. Can we meet sometime during the night?"</p> <p>"Of course, that's all I can get you to do anyway. It'll be a little while tonight."</p> <p>"I'll drive over and meet you at ten," Marge said as she picked up the phone. She didn't tell Dave about her meeting with the clients. He didn't think much about it at all, he just wanted to have a little fun with the girl.</p> <p>"So," he said after he hung up and put back down the phone. "Do you want me to do anything to help? You're obviously going to be able to do it at least," he asked.</p> <p>"That depends. Are you taking any steps to help me right now?" she asked.</p> <p>"No."</p> <p>"Why?"</p> <p>"They might try to blackmail me," he said. "Or I might try to control their behavior. That's all part of the plan. I didn't tell you where my meeting was going to be. You might think I'm just talking with your boss, but trust me, if they try to do any of that to me, you will have to give me a big presentation. My boss told me he had to get my number, that's all."</p> <p>As she sat there, he wondered what she was going to do. Was she hoping to blackmail him in order to put him in his place so that it would go in the office, so that his boss could say that he couldn't do it? The one chance he had, that had been presented to him, was that very one.</p> <p>He knew that he could get her to do anything to him that she wanted, but what if she had to blackmail him? Could she be that evil? Just having his help would be enough.</p> <p>"I'm going to go make my coffee, let's eat a few bites of muffins and then I'll talk to you a bit later. I'll have to take care of that. Just make sure that I don't talk to my boss. He isn't going to be upset if it's no help from you," as he hung up the phone.</p> <p>"I love you," he said to the empty room the two of them had at his home.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>Marge was in the bedroom when Dave arrived at his home, she had her robe on. "You got me that coffee a little fast," she told her husband as she handed him the drink.</p> <p>"Thanks, I needed to get all that paperwork done."</p> <p>"It's all going to be done in your homeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
