He reached up and untied my hands and I let him take those off me. I just wanted to lie there and feel him move. I was tired, but not asleep... and my body was responding.</p> <p>"So beautiful," he said. He pushed out quickly and I saw his cock. It was standing and hard and long... it was a big round head, with no skin to let it slip into. It had to be close to 6 inches and a big fat knob that was almost a purple knob, if his thickness was going in there...</p> <p>"Let me take off this too," he said, as he took the straps of the towel away and the wet towel was wrapped around his head, just a bit at the base. He bent down a bit and then rubbed his cock on my face. It was shiny from my saliva and when he pushed it a little in I was still asleep for a couple of long seconds, just watching him.</p> <p>He pulled back and looked me down. "I don't want to hurt you," he said, staring at my now half-hard, and dripping wet, cock, "do no wrong," he said, "I always want you for that and more."</p> <p>Oh god, he actually wanted me?... he was going to fuck me? What was I thinking and having to put up with this?</p> <p>"Come on," he said. He was still looking at my dick, "let's find out." He lifted my chin and held it up with his hand. "Get on your back," he said, and, as I did, he dropped the towel on a chair and then climbed over me...</p> <p>"Is this the right position?" he asked, as he pressed himself into me. The head of his cock slid deep into me and I felt the tight warmth of his balls. It was huge! he was so big! it was too big!</p> <p>"No," I said, "it will be just fine."</p> <p>"It will be fine," he said as he reached down and started to stroke my cock again. It stiffened up in his hand and his balls were tight and big... then, not to be outdone, he used his hand to start to wank me, gently, at first, then a little harder as his hand slid up and down it's length. It was so hot! It actually felt good. I was getting turned on!</p> <p>"Look at you," he said, "I don't think you can wait for me." He looked away from me then. "Come on my beautiful, sexy wife," he said, "just look at our bodies." He kept his leg propped up on the bed on one side as he began to pump his length harder into me. His other hand was stroking my cock... making it so hard and swollen to that point that I was beginning to think I was going to cum in his hand.</p> <p>"I want to fuck you," he said, "it's only fair that you do this first..." He pumped me harder now using all of his strength. "And if you didn't do this first..."</p> <p>"I didn't do this, you big bastard!" I hissed, "Fuck me!"</p> <p>"Just do it," he begged. "Make it good for me." His hand kept stroking my cock. "We don't have long. You can see how much you mean to me." He pumped me for a little bit, getting me closer to the edge, then stopping. "You're going to take me. You are going to take me!"</p> <p>"It will hurt," I said, trying to get free of his hand. "Let me do it."</p> <p>Instead, he twisted his hips and slid deep into me, his balls slapping against me. "You have to do this," he said, "it's better if you do it slowly and see what happens."</p> <p>His hand pumped like a pro now, stroking the whole length of my cock. As he slid deep into me, his breath on it took my breath away. "Oh!" I said. "It feels so nice!"</p> <p>"Do it," he encouraged, "make me come too. Just do it!"</p> <p>I did. I took his ass in my hands and pushed him deep into me. My cock was so hard again, I could hardly hold back. My head was back, my eyes shut, and I felt every inch of his hardness as it slid into me. It was like I have always wanted him.</p> <p>He was kissing me again now, his breath hot on my face, his whole body warm... there was a warmth that ran down the middle of my back. "Do it," I said softly, "do it for me."</p> <p>I had never even considered having a cock in my assâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
