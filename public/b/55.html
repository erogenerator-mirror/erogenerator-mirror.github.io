NO! please don't hurt me!"</p> <p>Jodie was confused by her lover's response to her fear. She'd not seen her lover's face before and was shocked to say the least. She still hadn't seen the fear in her eyes. She quickly turned back to face the wall and leaned in even closer.</p> <p>"What? What do you mean? What do you want? Where are the kids?"</p> <p>Breathing hard, Janelle was getting up from her back and running out of the bedroom, almost knocking Jodie over. She was getting further away. As it turned out; her mind was completely focused on the fear that was filling her eyes as she ran. Her heart was thumping in her chest and she felt that she was about to hyperventilate.</p> <p>Janelle opened her eyes just as the door of her brother's bedroom was closing. There was a slight smile on her lips as her eyes darted back to see if she could see what she had been dreaming about the night before.</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"I mean...what happened back there, the first time we touched? Where is that coming from? What happened?"</p> <p>"I didn't know you two were together... you were acting strange. I just had... thoughts about you the whole time we were together." Janelle's eyes searched her face as she tried to make sense of what her brain was thinking.</p> <p>The way Janelle said it made Jodie look over in the mirror at the bed in her left hand.</p> <p>"You and Momma? That's not funny! Where did you... when did...?"</p> <p>"I had the same dreams every night now and I've always done the right thing."</p> <p>"You never did it, did you?"</p> <p>"I'm sorry," Janelle said. "You didn't know I had dreams about you."</p> <p>"Yeah, right."</p> <p>"I thought you and Momma... I thought you'd... um... did it then."</p> <p>"Oh, it was OK, but I didn't want your mother finding out about us."</p> <p>"Oh?"</p> <p>"Yeah." This confused Jodie. "My own mother... who I'll bet I still can trust now."</p> <p>"Me too..."</p> <p>"Why are you telling me this? What happened between us this time? I was asleep and you were watching me and Momma."</p> <p>"I knew you were asleep when I came in from you. Momma was in bed watching me. You looked so peaceful and happy. How long... have we been sleeping...?"</p> <p>"I don't know. It was kinda slow..."</p> <p>"No... it's no, not slow at all. I'll get back to you sometime."</p> <p>"Don't do anything you're not comfortable with. I mean it. It's just the two of us."</p> <p>"But when I woke up, I didn't know what was going on... I couldn't get you out of my head. Not just the feeling. There was something about you. I don't know what is happening. It's just too weird to even fathom. You're a good guy... you're never going to be like that again."</p> <p>Janelle looked over at the mirror again. This time she stared directly down at Jodie's face as it looked so peaceful. Her body language was much more relaxed than before and she knew that her lover was still in a haze of emotions. After a long moment, Jodie felt her lover's tears rolling down her cheek, while her mind drifted in the comfort of a warm bath and the comfort of the love that her loved was always bringing her.</p> <p>'So we're still asleep together...?'</p> <p>"Momma's in her bath? I thought you were asleep."</p> <p>"No, I wasn't. I was just so... happy."</p> <p>Janelle reached out and held a hand to her lover's head. "You're still so calm and beautiful, my love. How can you be so calm and loving?"</p> <p>"Momma's in her bath."</p> <p>"She's beautiful, isn't she?"</p> <p>"I don't know."</p> <p>"I know, but you have to try. You don't have to sleep around."</p> <p>"How can you be so sure when Momma's in her... oh, that feels so good! It's like you're just in another part of your..."</p> <p>"Yes!" Jodie's voice sounded as if she was at times having a nightmare. She knew that she had to be careful. "Please, it's nothing."</p> <p>"Why not? She's in your bathâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
