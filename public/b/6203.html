"Yeah...I guess I'm not very good either. I guess I'll just go try to make up with guys."</p> <p>She smiled, "I bet you do."</p> <p>I kissed her, "Maybe you would just be the girl I'd be looking for."</p> <p>I didn't even try to hide how I felt about her. I was almost positive I was trying to get her to have sex with me. If we ended up in bed I'd fuck her, right there on the kitchen table. If she had sex with me I was going to be her fuck-buddy and she'd be my fuck-buddy. We'd never have a chance. The best place we'd ever have sex is on a kitchen table. But there I was, trying to impress my friend's wife and my potential girlfriend.</p> <p>I said, "You know there's nothing we can do to make things better...except try hard to be less aggressive. I'm not going to break into her house. I'm going to do something to make her happy."</p> <p>She smiled, "So you mean...you want me to fuck you?"</p> <p>"Of course I do. I know I'm not what you're looking for, but I guess I just find someone that's happy to be with me."</p> <p>"Are you sure?"</p> <p>When I told her about her own relationship with her boyfriend and being with others we started planning next week. I wasn't sure about what you and I should talk about so I invited her to my place on the Wednesday before the start of school.</p> <p>When she got to the party, she wasted no time getting her things together. She was wearing a mini skirt and a blouse. After several drinks, we were back in our apartment and I told her how I wanted her to feel good. I took our coats off, "Put your shirt over your shoulders, put on your glasses, lay down on the bed, and relax."</p> <p>"I don't know why this is happening all the time. I've been drinking and not sure if I want to do anything anymore," I said to her. That was the first time I'd fucked Dani. It was on the couch, right there on the night I'd done the deed. I had been waiting for her in the bar and then topless in front of people we knew they were there to celebrate her new life. Her nipples had been hard the whole time we'd been going out but she hadn't been able to touch herself.</p> <p>Dani had already taken off her clothes but I went for her clothes and helped her with them. We talked about it then, how she felt about it and what we should do. She agreed readily, knowing I would never be able to convince her to do something she'd really never done for herself. We lay in each other's arms for a long time. One of her hands was between her legs playing with her pussy, the other rubbing at her breasts.</p> <p>"I've always been scared to tell anyone that if I go in and out and get fucked I'm going to end up with a disease. I can see my parents, who probably think I'm a slut, would be a little uncomfortable with some kind of disease. But right now I can go get tested."</p> <p>"I understand how you feel. I'm not sure what you want to go through. Don't be stupid. Sex with women is amazing. It's not cheating if we go through with it. I can see that you don't want to end up with nothing to worry about. You may be a little nervous."</p> <p>"I'm OK. I'm not going to ruin my new life but...let's try it if we have sex. Maybe it's like getting a new tattoo or something."</p> <p>"I don't know if I could do this," she said.</p> <p>"It could be your favorite kind of thing. It could be fun."</p> <p>"So you've never done this before?"</p> <p>"Of course, I've never been with a woman before." I hadn't even really thought about that.</p> <p>"Would you want me to do this? Because of your boyfriend."</p> <p>"I don't know...I'm not sure. Maybe, once I'm in bed or I get horny I'll want to do it."</p> <p>"I won't lie to you."</p> <p>"OK...but if I'm going to do this, it'll be better. If I'm doing this, it's more than sex."</p> <p>"I don't know. If you do this, I'll be overjoyed."</p> <p>"And I won't make it into a porn star. But I promise to be niceâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
