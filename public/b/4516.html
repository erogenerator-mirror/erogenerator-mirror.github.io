I replied.</p> <p>"Look here my boss wants to see you in the morning. Go home and think of that girl that you were with last night and see if you can get her again." she said with a laugh.</p> <p>That was it, I felt like the luckiest man on earth and headed to my office to think of it all off. I sat down to get a cup of tea. The feeling was that I had to go to sleep, the dreams that came to me after the morning events came on fast and easy, I could feel their intense intensity, they were hard to get rid of and felt really good to get home to. I turned out to be wrong again, the day went on and on.</p> <p>The next morning, my boss called me and told me to shower, pack and leave for home early, I did as she wanted this morning, I left to have a shower at the end of the day. I was home as fast as my imagination could take me. I was in my living room having a drink when I looked up and saw her from a doorway that only a short distance away. I looked up as she entered the room.</p> <p>I walked over and she smiled at me, I knew she was happy at how well things went last night; she had a look of adoration in her eyes when she realized I was sitting on the sofa.</p> <p>"Good morning." I said. She came over and sat down, and handed me a glass of water from the fridge.</p> <p>"I hope you're not angry with me this morning." She said. "I got caught up in the middle of a thing and I was just about to go home, it's been over a week since I last saw her. I don't blame them," she said, with some sadness.</p> <p>"I know, I have no problem with it and I like having this time alone." I gave her my glass and she took it from me.</p> <p>"So how does it change things in the world?" She asked as she sat back down. I was surprised and she knew it.</p> <p>"I like it. My job really sucks but I like to do it, there is so much I want to do." I said truthfully.</p> <p>At that point, I couldn't see how my life would change, at that point I was ready to settle into an old man, but now I was a new person, I wasn't my old self, I was new, I was her new self.</p> <p>We drank our water and she spoke first.</p> <p>"I think we could go another round if you want. Just have a few more drinks."</p> <p>"That sounds good."</p> <p>"Can I see more of you?" she said almost pleading with me.</p> <p>I agreed, she pulled the sheet off our clothes and we started to strip her clothes before she pulled the sheet and bedclothes off of her. I was already naked from work, I sat down beside her and let her lay on top of me. We kissed and touched and kissed. I couldn't get enough of her body, she felt incredible on her back, our tongues were dancing like never before, her hands were caressing my body up and down in a way that I found myself responding to.</p> <p>She pushed me onto my back and started to climb up on top of my body, she slid my pants down, along with my boxers, and she got to my cock in one smooth motion. She smiled at me and looked at me, I just stared back with lust.</p> <p>She started to roll around, I didn't push into her so I was happy to have her sitting on top of me, watching intently as she rode me. Her breasts were hanging over me as she bounced up and down, my face was right next to her nipples, each time she would bounce up and down I would see that they were pointing slightly upwards, as she leaned over with her arms on my chest.</p> <p>At one point, she had me by the chest and kissed me as she rode me, she slid down slightly so that she was facing me and then she lifted up slightly, and slowly slid down my shaft from my head to my balls. She looked me in the eye, as she continued to bounce up and down, it didn't take her long to have me come inside of her, I felt her vagina gushing my seed as I felt her come on me.</p> <p>She climbed off me and lay beside me. She was on the bottom with her legs on either side of mine. We kissed, we stroked and kissed, we fucked, we kissed.</p> <p>It took several days before I could get back to her, I found I was working more hard on the farm than I was. I tried to talk to her, but she wouldn't accept it and I was afraid of her feelings for me.
