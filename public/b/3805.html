It really means a lot knowing you still want me too."</p> <p>"Thank you, babe," he said before he hung up.</p> <p>He was a little embarrassed at the way her words came out in such a way. There was a certain intimacy in the way she responded, despite having just been with a man. He felt his heart beat a little faster as his fingers toyed with her pussy lips and clit. His cock jumped and he felt a little wetness on his balls. He reached over and slid his hand over her nipple, rubbing it in small circles. He pulled away and ran his tongue from the top of her knee up to her ear, where he nibbled her earlobe before he said, "Wow. I love hearing girls say the words."</p> <p>"I'm glad," she said, "I got really, really wet in the shower, but it doesn't matter as we'll go back to being boys again. I'm glad I got to that beach with you. It just took me to the edge and then went back to reality," she whispered with a laugh. They both knew what they had just done had the result they both wanted.</p> <p>"You sure are ready to get back to what we're doing now. Maybe you'll feel better after the long drive and have a better time if you take me to the ocean before we go to the beach."</p> <p>"There's only this one beach now, isn't it babe?" she asked.</p> <p>He nodded.</p> <p>"Well, let's get off the road and I'll show you to our room."</p> <p>They exchanged kisses and he headed her to the room knowing if he stayed there she may not give him what he had just given her. She gave him a quizzical look as if she could have anticipated what they were about to do, but instead just looked at him and said, "I'm not really sure. I'm not sure what's going to happen. I'm just going to stand here with you, okay?"</p> <p>"Okay," he said.</p> <p>"Let's see if I got there before we get lost," she said with her face turning a very sexy shade of red.</p> <p>She grabbed the two-seater car, which wasn't exactly the best choice of clothes in the world. But then remembered that it was a summer rental and she and her husband had a beach house on the back of theirs. She turned on the stereo and laid down on a soft couch in their room. She laid back and he watched while she worked. He sat there quietly as she played her guitar. "How do you feel about it, baby?"</p> <p>"I don't know. I'm not totally sure where we are in the world here right now," he said through clenched teeth.</p> <p>"Good," was all she said and he said and agreed.</p> <p>"But, at this point in our lives we're only going to be in this room for another thirty-eight hours, maybe another twenty-eight," she said quietly, "and I'm so happy. I feel as if we can continue what we started."</p> <p>"Me too," he said, "and, it just feels weird having you in my bed while I'm so much more at peace."</p> <p>"That must make you feel weird that we might just be living like this if we're having a life."</p> <p>"Well, I was hoping that you'd feel that way," he said seriously.</p> <p>"And you're so welcome."</p> <p>They started with her getting out of her clothes and she laid on the bed after he had removed his shoes. After that, she took off her towel and they kissed. Once they had reached the bed, she lay down with him, his hard cock pressing against her pussy. He pulled his shirt off and they were both nude. He held her breasts while she continued to caress him with her hands, squeezing his cock and massaging his balls.</p> <p>"Ooh, he's so ready," she said playfully, "I can't believe how good you taste when you're hard." They kissed some more. "Can you suck me?" he asked.</p> <p>"Can I be the one sucking you?" she asked and then looked at him as if she was challenging him.</p> <p>"Don't you even want to?" he said, "I mean I really enjoyed this, but now that you're here, maybe it'd be a little uncomfortable."</p> <p>"It's okay," she said, "if you don't mind the risk of some of your clients seeing us, then I'm okay."</p> <p>Now she was lying in his bed with his arms around her, his cock pressing against her pussy when they both realized that it wasn't all that uncomfortableâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
