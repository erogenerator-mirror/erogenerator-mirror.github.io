"I like that too."</p> <p>"That was some first date."</p> <p>"I can't really explain it, just that you seemed so nice after the first date."</p> <p>"You're just saying that because the first date hasn't happened."</p> <p>"Yes, you're very right and you have a point there."</p> <p>"Yes, she did have a point about the first date."</p> <p>"She might have made other plans."</p> <p>"She did. She knew what night was, that we would talk. You know, we just decided to meet for lunch."</p> <p>"Well, I guess I can accept that." He smiled. "When it came time to tell you the other day, that I thought it was a good idea, I had to ask, because I couldn't think of the right way to ask."</p> <p>"I hope so..."</p> <p>"I don't know what it is, we just happen to be close friends. We have many things going for us."</p> <p>"I see. So, did you and your girl get laid? Before, last weekend?"</p> <p>"Of course we did. We did something that was more romantic than I expected, but she did make up for that by letting me eat in the car to save us time, so we can sit and talk some."</p> <p>She smiled. "I think we made it too romantic for your girlfriend."</p> <p>"I know but I like that we weren't too careful."</p> <p>'I wonder if there are things she could have done that didn't make you think so." She grinned.</p> <p>He pulled the car into the mall parking lot and parked the car.</p> <p>"I can't believe how lucky I am," he exclaimed.</p> <p>"And I can't believe you didn't think that she was a virgin, either."</p> <p>"That's what I'd say," he answered.</p> <p>"Well, I'm still a virgin."</p> <p>He grinned. "Maybe I'm a lucky man that you are."</p> <p>"I'm glad. I guess it was a pretty good first date."</p> <p>He looked over at her, thinking that it might have been a good first date for a few seconds.</p> <p>"She sure is a good girl."</p> <p>"As good as you?"</p> <p>"That's a good question," she replied. "Do they ever do something like that with a date that is so special? We don't do anything like that all the time."</p> <p>He considered but had to ask himself the next step.</p> <p>"What about when you were alone with a girl in your house?" He finally asked.</p> <p>She looked at her watch. "Oh, yeah, we usually go in separate rooms, but it was sort of convenient."</p> <p>"You're making no sense."</p> <p>"We both were; we just had to take care of each other, right?"</p> <p>"Of course, now that we are closer."</p> <p>"What do we do now?"</p> <p>"Well," he said, looking out of the windshield, "I can't say that I would put up a fight, but we have to see if it's really appropriate for a first date."</p> <p>"It looks as if the decision was made, but now that it is, let's make it quick before someone decides to fuck their girlfriend."</p> <p>"That's good."</p> <p>"I hope that isn't going to be a problem, you know, because I love her so much."</p> <p>"You're right."</p> <p>When they pulled into the parking lot of Jada's, Jada ran to the door, grabbed her keys.</p> <p>"Wait."</p> <p>She ran over to her car and got into it. She saw that her car was empty. She looked in the rear view mirror. Yes, it indeed looked that way.</p> <p>She opened the back door and reached down, lifting and pushing it to open the front doors. She saw the car and opened the back door for her friends, then hopped into the front seat.</p> <p>They sat a few seconds, then Jada looked at the keys again and started to open them.</p> <p>"Take them to the front desk and let me call the room."</p> <p>As she was walking away, she called the number.</p> <p>When she returned, they were both shaking with anticipation.</p> <p>When the door opened again, she held her open hand.</p> <p>"Thank you very much for everything, Jada. It was a really special date."</p> <p>"Thank you for everything that you were doing," she replied.</p> <p>"You don't have to repay me," he answered.</p> <p>"I can't say that I have, but I will," she smiled.</p> <p>He smiled, too. "I thought we were going to meet again?"</p> <p>"I suppose so.
