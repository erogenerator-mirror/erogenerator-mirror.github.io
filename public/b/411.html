He pulled it out and moved it over her pussy.</p> <p>"Ohhh," she gasped and turned her head away with surprise.</p> <p>"You didn't like this?" he asked.</p> <p>"Not really."</p> <p>He knelt and rubbed her clit, which immediately got an electric thrill. He leaned forward and kissed her, tonguing her mouth, his fingers working away, one pressing between her wet lips. She tasted her own lubrication and enjoyed it as much as he did. He felt something hard against the head of his cock, and pushed it between her pussy lips.</p> <p>"Please," she moaned, as he pushed it in a little more.</p> <p>"It won't hurt," he teased as he paused to kiss her again. His thrusting became faster, harder. He pushed in a little farther, pushing in, and out, each time pulling out, so that he moved right up to her clit with each push.</p> <p>She came again. Hard!</p> <p>Then he pulled out and bent her over the arm of the sofa. She reached for something to help. It was a strap around her neck, something she didn't recognize, but she found it and fastened it. She hadn't been wearing anything under it for many months now, and now she felt the cool leather as he fastened it to her breast. He moved behind her again. Her fingers grabbed the dildo and held it. He pressed it against her ass hole at the same time and pushed.</p> <p>"Fuck me," she said softly.</p> <p>He nodded and she felt the dildo move inside her.</p> <p>He leaned over her and kissed her. "Do you want it?" he asked her.</p> <p>"Oh, do you?"</p> <p>"Yes, I do. It's so big. You can take it."</p> <p>He pressed hard and it went in. It was long, but not as thick as the dildo and it seemed to go in and out as it pulled out, so that she could feel it on her cervix.</p> <p>She moaned, and reached back to feel the dildo inside her. "Don't move," she felt him place the dildo at the opening of her pussy, then begin to push. "Oh, that's nice."</p> <p>He pushed it up the whole way and began to slide it in and out.</p> <p>"Oh, this is so good," she whispered.</p> <p>Her fingers worked her clit. The leather dildo was moving more quickly now.</p> <p>He was thrusting into her as she held the dildo in her ass while they kissed. Slowly he moved his cock in and out, the leather on flesh stimulating both sets of nerves.</p> <p>"Yes!" she shouted and climaxed. She felt her body jolt with it and her fingers dug into his back. She gasped and let lose a shuddering scream as he continued to kiss her neck and hold her close against the sofa.</p> <p>Suddenly he felt the dildo in her ass. It was moving inside her and pushing against her in a way that felt good — the feeling of being filled and stretched, her tightness, her tightness. It seemed to go on and on until the sensation became more intense, and still it moved in her. It had been a while, and had been uncomfortable, but his stiff cock, feeling it pushing inside her, sliding into her ass — it had become something more of an instinct than one of pleasure.</p> <p>When he heard herself shouting in pleasure, he began slowly, thrusting, pulling almost all the way out, then thrusting as deep as he could into her, then thrusting again. The dildo had never felt so good! It felt almost as powerful as a man's shaft, and the sensation was exquisite. "Oh, oh, fuck me, fuck me!" she screamed as she felt his cock driving inside her. It was the same as if he had been standing up right in front of her with it in her mouth. It had been years since she had felt so strongly. The sensation was intense, and she couldn't stop herself from cumming.</p> <p>He had been watching her and his excitement quickly grew. When he looked over at the sofa, he saw his friend leaning over the sofa toward her. He turned toward the man who now was moving the dildo in and out of his friend's pussy, and saw that the man was still going. He was sitting on the sofa with the dildo moving in and out with a slow, steady motion.</p> <p>"Ohh, this is so hot," said the other man. "I really like it here."</p> <p>The men both laughed.</p> <p>After several minutes of fucking each other, and occasionally thrusting as deeply as they could go, he heard her.
