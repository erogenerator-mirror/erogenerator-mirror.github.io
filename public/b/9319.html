They both smiled and kept running their hands over their faces, then they kissed again. Kim could feel Kim's heart racing as his hard shaft poked against her thigh, she could even feel it in her jeans. "And you have gorgeous hair," her heart skipped a beat as she saw how her friend had long tangerine red hair. Kim's eyes flicked around at all the male bodies that moved in line and looked the same in every single one of them. She knew it was the best compliment the girls ever got!</p> <p>"And you're really pretty well-rounded too," her heart skipped another beat as she saw one of their friends have a perfect tan. "Thank you, honey," her heart skipped a beat as they broke their kiss.</p> <p>"I'm glad," said one of the other girls, Kim's nipples hardened as her mouth moved closer to their friend's lips.</p> <p>Kim's head snapped around as she saw her best friend Kim had the same type of hair!</p> <p>"Oh! Kim! Hi. My name is Kim," he said as he reached out his hand and took one of Kim's and they shook.</p> <p>"And that's my friend Kim," said Kim as she smiled at her friend's face. "I saw you here all the time. I was going to ask if you had company tonight," she asked Kim out of curiosity. Kim was a little shocked because she knew she had never had any female companionship during her stay here since being with her parents so many years ago.</p> <p>"Well...yes, of course. It was the first time that I was here. The first time all three of us were with each other. "</p> <p>"Oh! Kim! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to..."</p> <p>"Don't worry. We're both adults here. I don't mind being friendly with your new friend," he grinned as he took Kim's hand and took her away from his friend.</p> <p>"Oh! Hi," she said as she moved a little closer to the three young ladies.</p> <p>"I'm Jack and this is his girlfriend Pam." Their eyes met first and then Kim had to move. "Hi, my name is Kim. I work for the agency," she said as she smiled and looked at Pam.</p> <p>"Hi, so you're my new friend Kim. Pam, I know your name," said Kim as she turned to see Pam smiling up at her. Pam couldn't help but notice as she looked over at the others.</p> <p>"Kim, you really have lovely hair, it's very attractive." Pam's eye twinkled as she stood up and took Kim's hand. "Oh! Hi, I'm Pam, Kim's new friend," she said as she moved closer to the tall blonde. "I'm sure you'd like to come and see the resort."</p> <p>"Oh! Yes, of course."</p> <p>Kim giggled, "So, we're all alone?"</p> <p>"Yes, of course. You're sure to see a lot of new friends."</p> <p>"Yes, as a matter of fact that is. I'm sure I won't need anymore clothes until tomorrow."</p> <p>"Do you always wear those same clothes at these resort?" asked Kim as they moved in for a hug.</p> <p>"No, only about an hour ago I told you. All three of us come here and we spend the night with our best new friends. So," said Pam as Kim put her arm around Pam's waist. "I'm sure you'll like the resort. It's so beautiful!"</p> <p>Pam couldn't help but smile a little as Kim held her close. "I do hope I'll find you again. Maybe the next time we come here are we can come over the next day," she said as her hand moved a little closer to Kim's breasts.</p> <p>"Well, I'd love that! I'm sure we'll see each other soon," said Kim with a smile.</p> <p>She stepped forward and kissed Pam's cheek, then she held Pam's eyes as she whispered into her ear, "Come on." As they moved into the resort, Kim turned away and walked towards the door.</p> <p>Kim grabbed a towel and her new friend Pam's arm. "Let me dry you off first," Kim told Pam, then she put her arms around the hot blonde. After her friend was dry, Kim slipped her hands up Kim's arms and under her shirt. Kim pushed at Kim's shirt as Kim leaned back and gave Pam a gentle shoulder rub.</p> <p>"Now I'm ready to get out of this wet shirt," Kim giggled with a grin.</p> <p>"Come here," said Kim as she pulled her friend with her against her body and kissed her deeply.
