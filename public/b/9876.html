Her room was to be his - one of his. When he knocked, she was standing a few feet ahead of it, and he could see from her eyes that she was in tears. He opened the door and gently stepped back. She was sitting on the bed, crying, sitting with her chin on her crossed hands, and she was in her white cotton nightgown, but her tears were streaming from her eyes. He put his small hand protectively over hers, and she began to sob again and again while he continued to hold her hands. She lay there for some time, and when she began to sob her hand was stilled, but he felt a twinge in his stomach and began to lift her chin to see her eyes.</p> <p>Her eyes were big and glistening, and her eyes were dark and wet and blue. He felt like something was broken during that tear-filled period when she was so afraid to look at him, but it was over. He felt ashamed in her eyes, but it was his body that betrayed him for that - it gave her that strength with which her body could so easily absorb pain.</p> <p>His wife started to say something, but he held her hand still and looked into her eyes, knowing that now that she had heard the story it wouldn't be fair for him to force any information from her. She knew he was trying his best. He lifted her chin so that he could see the tears in her eyes, and kissed her forehead which she had wiped with little strokes of her fingers. He had a strong feeling that that would not have been hard to forgive if he had just looked.</p> <p>It took several minutes for a calmness to build deep inside her as he let her hold her emotions for several more minutes. Finally, after several minutes of tears, she took each of his hands in hers and smiled weakly at him. At that moment he realised that there was a tremendous need for this man, his life, to be strong for her and that he wasn't going to be able to make herself cry when she had no more experience. He was just going to have to deal with what she was going to say next.</p> <p>"I am so sorry for not saying anything, but you don't do anything for me. I just want to make this moment as special as possible, for both of us. I think it will give us both a chance to get past this." He was trying to make the words that he was trying to say come out, in words that would never work.</p> <p>She smiled and took hold of his hand. She held it gently against her cheek. "My God, what would that be?"</p> <p>"I think it would be very beautiful," he answered and started to kiss her. He was shocked at the feel of her lips, and her tongue which was touching he palm. There was no doubt that he had made her weak in the knee, but now he was having more control of himself. She kissed him back as gently as if she could make it. He was becoming aroused again, and his cock was beginning to strain against his slacks. It was already becoming quite hard, but she noticed immediately without looking at it that it was beginning to grow.</p> <p>"My beautiful, beautiful man," she said softly, "you are making me very weak."</p> <p>"I was beginning to think I knew better," he answered, "but now I have come to know that you really want to make this day as special as possible. You want to make it special for both of us?" She nodded her head.</p> <p>"I wanted to make this moment a special day for both of us. It's not just something to do to you, it's a gift we both wish to share. I don't want to break something either..." She nodded. "But I also want to see if I can help you and I wanted to encourage you to be a stronger woman."</p> <p>"I will tell you more," he said, turning to look into her eyes again, "just a little."</p> <p>They kissed again then, and he looked into her eyes for the first time that day. He lifted his face once again just enough so that their lips parted and their tongues met, and they both knew what each other's intentions were. He put his arms around her and pulled her up so that she was standing on her tiptoes. She wrapped her arms around his neck and held him close, pressing her body in for his. His hands moved from her face, around to her side and up her back, and he cupped the soft, little bottom of her breasts that looked so soft and high in the tautness of her thin cotton nightdress.</p> <p>He put his hands to her bottom and beganâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
