She felt his tongue run over her labia before parting them slightly; it slid between them and she felt the hardness of his prick press against her inner thigh. Her pussy was wet but, to add to the heat and anticipation of him sucking on her clit, it also felt damp and sticky, all of it, just the way it felt for him. She held his head, and with her fingers she guided him further into her, feeling his tongue explore every nook and cranny in her most private regions; her body wanted to be touched, and was on fire as he continued to kiss and lick her vagina. She felt him push himself further into her, and she lifted herself higher.</p> <p>His cock was now fully embedded in her and without any other movement, he began to fuck her, pushing up against her with his body against hers to meet every plunge. The feeling was exquisite, and she could feel herself about to have her most delicious orgasm. Her eyes were tightly closed, trying to keep to herself on the threshold between pleasure and pain, but it was impossible. It took all her effort to pull his cock deeper into her, and she felt his balls swinging against her body, and he was thrusting with harder and harder, his balls swinging to her thighs and the bed, and she could hear the moans escaping her lips. The room was getting darker, she thought, almost like the outside world. She wanted him faster. Just a little deeper.</p> <p>"Dah!" she cried.</p> <p>And she felt him push himself deeper and deeper into her, as he did with hers, and the sound of his balls slapping against her body became an almost distant echo. He was on his back, and she was on her knees, with her own legs around his waist and supporting her weight against his chest. She looked him in the eyes and they were all ablaze with passion; and she whispered, breathlessly, in his ear, "I'm going to cum."</p> <p>"Yes!" he said to her. "Yes!"</p> <p>He watched himself rise and lower into her, and felt himself move, as if the motion was not far from him. He felt her legs and arms around him from behind. His balls slapped against her as he fucked her, harder and harder, deeper and deeper. Her body was quivering as he drove himself into her, and he could feel the heat deep in her. His strokes became longer, deeper, and deeper, and she screamed her way, as the sound of her orgasm was too much to wait.</p> <p>It was something she'd dreamed of since she first touched herself, and she felt as though it might be the only thing her body could imagine, and feel. Suddenly, without warning, deep inside her, she let loose and cried out. "Ah! Daa-dack! My God! I cumming!"</p> <p>And it came on her, as powerfully as the first of many earlier ones that had begun in her mind, and as she felt it, her whole body and soul were thrown into bliss. Waves of ecstatic sensation were crashing, crashing, crashing for the rest of existence; and as if being born from the momentous occasion, her consciousness soared higher and higher towards a state of rapture as the waves of orgasmic ecstasy broke over her mind and body, and the whole world disappeared into a mistless place where her mind and spirit remained. It was as though there was no one else in the room, where the words and phrases and words became nothing, not for her, not for herself, her whole being was merely in the moment; the universe was her universe. She could hear her own voice, to feel the reverberations that flowed through her, and she could feel the sensation as the body below her was joined by hers, and all of her thought ceased to exist. She lay on him, with his cock still firmly inside her, her body limp but feeling the after-effects of orgasms, the feelings of their connection, of being united, of being loved, even... and it was all a new experience, a new life. She could feel his prick inside her; feel it in her, her body; feel it on hers. But it didn't go away. There was still passion, no more.</p> <p>She lay there with his cock inside her, feeling it slide in and out of her, feeling it in her, her body. Then, she could feel him move inside her, his prick going deeper, deeper, all the way in and all the way out, the whole of those things that had mattered so very much. It made her feel as if the whole world mightâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
