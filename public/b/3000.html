I could go back to sleep by simply lying there with my legs tucked beneath me. I looked out over the water, wondering what that felt like.</p> <p>My hand had found my nipple, and I felt it harden as I caressed it between my fingers. I could see the light in my eyes, and felt the tingle that I hadn't been able to get in the shower. I glanced up at his face, and saw that he was watching our expressions in the water.</p> <p>'I guess it feels better to try one of those?' I asked him.</p> <p>'You can, but only with you, not me. If you don't mind, I'd prefer that you were with me for now though.'</p> <p>He hesitated, but took my arm and drew me out of the bath. I wrapped myself tightly, and put one leg over the edge of the tub; he knelt between my knees, the other over the side. He brought both hands to my face, and kissed me gently on the lips. As he did so, he started to stroke my chest again, one hand stroking over my breast, while the other kept itself busy between my legs. I moaned as he slid one finger down past my slit, and dipped it inside me.</p> <p>'Mmmm,' I murmured as he pulled his finger from me. Again, he kept it toying with my clit, and used it to slide two fingers in and out of me while his thumb massaged my clit hood.</p> <p>'I can feel you wanting to cum.' He warned, as he kissed my mouth again.</p> <p>'Just...just a little more,' I breathed.</p> <p>My breathing was ragged as he gently inserted his finger, and I felt him slowly pulling it out as my legs began to tremble. In response to his fingers, my clitoris had also begun to swell with need. I knew I couldn't keep my pussy from contracting as I approached orgasm with him.</p> <p>'Please...please...' I begged, my voice muffled by his lips.</p> <p>But he wouldn't hear me. Instead, he began to move his fingers in and out, twisting them against my g-spot, his thumb pressing against my clit. My back arched, and my back arched up in the tub, as I began to orgasm. I gripped his back with the force of my legs, my muscles tensing around his fingers. He paused briefly to slip his middle finger back into my pussy, just as I was about to cum again—which wasn't too late, after all.</p> <p>I collapsed into the tub, and he knelt back on his paws, his face buried in the water. He was breathing hard, and his expression so serious that I got scared and wanted to tell him off for making me cum so quickly.</p> <p>'Why'd you stop?' I choked out.</p> <p>He reached out and swiped the water from my cheek. 'Because I like to make you cum,' he said, and I felt his fingers leave my body.</p> <p>'Please, don't leave!' I begged, and he simply looked at me and shook his head.</p> <p>'Why should I leave?' he asked.</p> <p>'Because I want you. I want to make you feel what it was so many times before,' I answered, hoping it would hold.</p> <p>He smiled and gently pulled me onto my side, with his arm around me, until we were spooned. Then he pulled his hand away from my face and placed his fingers over my lips.</p> <p>'You want me to make you taste yourself?' he asked and I just shook my head and he stroked my hair until I opened my mouth to invite him in.</p> <p>And so we began to eat each other's juices, tasting each other's flavours. He took my cock in his mouth, and I pushed my finger in and out of his ass as his tongue flicked me. It was hot and wild and I tried to imagine all the things we could do that day.</p> <p>The more I tried, the more I wanted him to eat me, to suck me, to lick me. But we were too exhausted for any more, not to mention that I couldn't feel my pussy being so sensitive.</p> <p>'I'm going to fuck you now,' he announced as he reached under me and pressed my legs further apart, and positioned himself above me. 'I've got your legs pinned over my shoulders now,' he said, before pressing a finger into the opening of my vagina.</p> <p>His other hand was busy between my legs, sliding his finger in and out of me. 'Does that feel good?' he asked.</p> <p>'Oh, yes,' I replied as he began to move his—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
