He turned and returned a few moments later, holding a pack of cigarettes in his hands. "Ah, yes, Mr. B...I can introduce myself, I'd like you to meet Mr. B. And like I said, I'm not going to be trying to cover my tracks or try to make you look bad for what you did, I...I'm sorry, but it's just a cigarette...and my first sentence...okay, I am sorry. Now, I'd just be a little embarrassed if you didn't want a repeat of what I just finished...but that's okay, right Mr. B?"</p> <p>"I...uhn, I'm not really in the mood right now. Do you have a moment to ask me your name?"</p> <p>"R..R-R...H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H," I stammered out as I took another pull on my cigarette.</p> <p>"Well," said the man as he placed a hand on my shoulder. "I must say, you're very pretty, but no one's ever called you any of the names, so you won't believe it, we mean it." He leaned in closer to my ear and said in a soothing but firm tone, "I know how you don't like to talk about this here today, don't worry about it, just come on in and have a seat. I'm just going to take a few sips of my coffee and tell you my name." He paused for a moment to let me catch my breath. "I think you might like to take a few minutes to tell your story...I'm just going to take a few minutes to explain it to you, so just come on in."</p> <p>I felt an awkward, shaky hand start to rub my chest as I walked slowly toward the table. "I...I'm sorry," I said out loud. I glanced about quickly and saw that the table was at its height so my height meant just inches apart from each other at the far end of the table. "I...ah...I'll give you a chance, huh?" I said trying to make eye contact with the man beside me. "I'm sorry. I don't mean to be rude, but it just sorta happened."</p> <p>The man chuckled and laughed as he took a sip of his coffee. "The thing that has really been worrying me is that you seemed to have a habit of walking around in front of people that are probably unaware...like you did with me the first time we met."</p> <p>"Huh...the first time we met," I agreed. "But...it's not so now...I think I'd rather take that break with you."</p> <p>"I can't believe it," said the man. "You're always so...so shy, especially with me."</p> <p>He moved his hand away from behind my back and started to lean toward me again. "Just tell me what you're thinking right now though...you're still not totally aware of your own feelings."</p> <p>"Oh, yes I am," I said looking down at the table right next to me. "I...I'm pretty embarrassed too. I'm trying to tell you that what you said about being embarrassed...about being in the wrong place."</p> <p>"And?" I asked, taking another sip of my coffee.</p> <p>"And I think, I'm the reason you're...looking at my hand a lot," he said. "I...I...I'm trying to tell you that what we were doing tonight...I couldn't stand being there."</p> <p>I had to laugh at the expression that crossed his face and the way his eyes looked down at me. "And you did?" I asked, staring at the man standing next to me now.</p> <p>Before I could reply though, it was too late. The stranger leaned closer across the table and put his face close to mine. "It seems as though you're looking at my hand a lot," he said in an equally calm voice. I shook my head slowly as I looked back at the man standing next to me. "That's how I usually pick up on a woman...that's how things are with men." He leaned close again and said in his reassuring manner, "Or at least those are very obvious signs of a man being uncomfortable about a woman being attracted to him."</p> <p>At first I was a little uncomfortable and let him go on. "You're making me feel uncomfortable," I said quietly, trying to make light of the conversation. As he leaned in closer, I could clearly see his hand on my shoulder and saw that the man was now rubbing it from above and under my sweater. When he leaned in closer, I was trying to ignore how close he was to my ear but, even with his hand there, it was impossible to ignore the fact that I'm notâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
