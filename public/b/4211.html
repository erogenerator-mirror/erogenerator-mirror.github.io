He asks looking over my shoulder at him, pulling me aside. My friend has a few of his friends over who just had a fight and were obviously getting some.</p> <p>"Nothing," I say to him, smiling. "He was just yelling at the women when they arrived. They're fine and the guys are just saying their goodbyes."</p> <p>"Ok!" He agrees, and I think he gets it as well as he asks "Where can we meet them?"</p> <p>"Come on, we can eat in my car," I say.</p> <p>"Ok, I'll meet you at the station in 15 minutes."</p> <p>"And," he adds.</p> <p>"Can you come to the station? We can walk there."</p> <p>"No, I can't get in." My friend grins, looks back and forth over me to see, and then looks back down at me standing next to him in the truck. He starts the truck and we pull out into traffic. We get out of the truck and just look at each other, and I smile and say "I love you!"</p> <p></p> <p>"I love you, too," He replies.</p> <p>"I'm heading in."</p> <p>We're headed toward the train station and a place with more cars and the people I'm talking to. I get out of the truck and give him a big hug.</p> <p>"Good to see you again, buddy," I smile, "and we'd better get to bed."</p> <p>"Thank you, my lady." He replies with a big smile on his face.</p> <p>"Can I get you a drink? A whisky or something?"</p> <p>"Honey, you're making me too hot. This heat is starting to go away and I really need a big drink." I look over at him smiling and with a smile "I'm right over in 30 minutes! And we'll have a long talk."</p> <p>"So, you want to talk in your car or in my truck, right?"</p> <p>"That depends what you're planning on doing. Just let me know when you reach us, ok?"</p> <p>"I'll tell you in 30 minutes, but you need to get in that truck too fast."</p> <p>'Just get in', I say. "Ok, I do. You're a man."</p> <p>"Thanks, honey," He says looking over at me. "I'll let you get dressed."</p> <p>"Oh, I think she needs some sleep."</p> <p>"She probably won," he says with a grin "just be careful."</p> <p>"I look like hell and will be soon," I say grinning.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>The next morning is the best thing we can say about the weather. I can see and smell rain, and the air is fresher. The train comes in at 5 to get to the station and we get off at the station. I can hear the people bustling around as I get out of the truck. I walk right up to him and give him a hug. He hugs back and kisses me while leaning into me and pressing his body against me; he puts his hand on the small of my back. We then walk up to the station and get on the train, he starts to say goodbye as we get off.</p> <p>"Let's go inside," I say to him. We walk inside and sit down and begin to chat. After few minutes, I smile at him and say hello to the station manager. I tell him I have to talk to my friend so he tells me to go down to the station and go over there. The train starts to move and I am standing in a door, watching the lights start to blink.</p> <p>"My friend, I'm afraid you may have been at this table too long."</p> <p>"I'm sorry, do I know you?"</p> <p>"Yes," I reply. "He is the same guy you told me about."</p> <p>"That's wonderful," he says, "I never met my friend, but I was sitting here in front of her!"</p> <p>"Ah, that's interesting." He says to me, "he's a nice guy."</p> <p>"That's what I want to hear, and you're the same guy." I say to him with a laugh and smile while we continue to talk.</p> <p>"I don't like to brag but I have a real good sense of humor," he says with a laugh.</p> <p>"You know, I'm trying not to tell you this, 'I'm a pretty nice person so do yourself a favor and tell her not to go into this with her friends and then bring over a couple of guys and go out."</p> <p>"Ok," he says smiling.</p> <p>"You'll see," I say with a laugh.</p> <p>"Well, I thought you guys had some time together, so I'm glad I canâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
