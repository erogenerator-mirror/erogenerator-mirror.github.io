Her arms were around him, clinging to him. He was lost. He didn't feel himself, he felt nothing.</p> <p>"Kiss me. Please. I need you right now," she said huskily. She took his face in her hands and pressed her lips to his. His entire body was aflame from the moment he kissed her, even his mouth tasted as he drank wine. She felt him react. He moved his head to deepen the kiss, his neck craning to reach her. He pulled back, "You're the most beautiful girl I've ever laid eyes on." He looked into her eyes, "Your eyes, those eyes... I thought you had the most beautiful body. Are you okay?" She nodded but still held onto him. He leaned over and captured her lips once more. She felt as if he was about to take her out of her mind. She tried to move back, but her fingers clutched to his biceps.</p> <p>He stepped back, releasing her. He saw the fear in her eyes before he spoke again. "Are we going to be able to get an abortion?" She shook her head in disbelief. "I didn't know women could feel this way."</p> <p>"Not anymore," she said. "We agreed that we would never do that. I was just not ready." Her eyes met his, her voice lowered and cold.</p> <p>"I don't think of it that way." He grabbed by chin and turned her to face him. "Kiss me again." She nodded. He leaned in, their noses were pressing together. She placed her arms around his neck, pulling him tightly against her. He wrapped his arms around her. "I can't say I'm ready yet," he joked. "Is the Pope Catholic."</p> <p>She kissed him, "No, do not say that." They kissed deeply before finally breaking and standing up. "Let's get home and get to bed." He pulled her against him again, and they kissed again as they walked. He opened her door and opened hers as he carried her into the room. He laid her down on the bed, and crawled up next to her.</p> <p>"I'd rather sleep with you."</p> <p>She rolled onto her side and took his hand. "I know," she said, "and I'm hungry." They shared two quick kisses and he laid next to her. They lay there for a long while, his arm across her, and her arm around his neck. It was the most peaceful moment she had ever experienced. She felt loved even though they were in love. She wasn't sure he felt the same way. He was so incredibly special to her and she felt as special to him as he gave her. He had given her so much to think about, he had also given her the most wonderful kiss ever, from both their minds. She could almost taste the tears she had shed while they kissed, and she knew he could too.</p> <p>He wrapped his arms around her and drew her into his body. She felt so safe in his arms. The weight of him on her, her on his shoulder, was comforting. He continued to kiss her slowly and deeply, his lips soft against hers. She was amazed at that feeling. Her arms went around his neck as her breathing slowed. He leaned in and pressed his lips against hers, he felt so close. It made her feel safe, that he was, too. He rolled her onto her back and slowly drew her dress up and off her body. He leaned on his elbow and kissed her gently. She was ready. She wanted more. She wanted him inside her. He reached down between them, and took hold of his penis. She watched as he moved it so it was positioned at her entrance. She opened her legs, and waited for him to enter her. He stopped, looking at her. His eyes were like two large pools.</p> <p>"Oh," she said, "I love you." He moved in slowly. She closed her eyes, her lips pursed in ecstasy. Her body was on fire. She felt his head push against her cervix. She felt so deliciously full. His eyes rolled into the back of his head, a smile formed on his lips. He continued to push, pushing, pushing, pushing inside her. She was so incredibly tight. She bit his shoulder to keep from screaming out. She was so tight he could feel it with every thrust. His lips touched her neck and his fingers found their way to her clit. They brushed the sensitive bud. She felt her body spasm. He kissed the side of her face as she came. She kissed his face and forehead as her body continued to shudder.</p> <p>He slowly eased himself out as she was still tight, the feeling having never come to her again.
