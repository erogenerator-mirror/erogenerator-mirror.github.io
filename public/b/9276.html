Sally couldn't think her heart would have thunk out with one of those who loved her. She did love her. Sally loved her. They had made love twice but he was just too damn young. Sally wasn't that young. She didn't look it. She was twenty a year old. She was young enough to feel what it is like to be loved, not know it. Sally had just finished college. She came home alone and found her family was gone forever. Her father had moved to another state and his mom had gone home to work a while until he could get a job. Sally knew she just needed someone to talk to.</p> <p>She sat for a few more minutes. Sally had to admit that now she was getting into the spirit of things, she was having some trouble understanding a whole family. There was no way she could be alone this weekend. She would do anything to be with any man. She needed him. For the first time she felt that being an 18 year old girl was possible. Sally knew she was a little late for the reunion but she made up her mind to make it. She needed him.</p> <p>Sally packed a small grocery bag and jumped into her car.</p> <p>"Where are we going?" she asked the car salesman who drove her to the mall. He thought there might be someone she could pick up and take home with her.</p> <p>"Oh. I'm not sure if that's what I mean. Why do you think it would make me feel better if you didn't buy me a car."</p> <p>"Why not? You can still drive it, you can still drive the old car you're driving."</p> <p>"You are so sweet. Do you know what we have bought Sally?"</p> <p>Sally looked at him but said nothing. Finally the salesman looked her in the eye and said that something was wrong. Sally realized for the first time that her own husband was going out of town on business. Sally had taken off to college and had hoped to meet a man, but it hadn't happened. She didn't know if he would say anything to her.</p> <p>"I can't think of anything we haven't had already," he said while looking intently at Sally. "You look young enough to be my daughter." He reached out and wrapped his hand around her arm.</p> <p>"Thanks. That's very kind of you. I'm not your kid anymore."</p> <p>The salesman's hand went from her arm to her hand for a moment while one hand cupped her face. It moved up and down as Sally stared at him.</p> <p>"I'm the oldest, in charge of the house and the maintenance man. It wouldn't look good for me to work all the time just to get a free car."</p> <p>"It would cost you $5000."</p> <p>"It should be yours or maybe you should have bought a car. I could fix it. You could make more money selling it for your friends. If I go to college or buy a bike you'll be out of there in six months. You could make a ton of money."</p> <p>Sally knew this was coming. She needed him bad. She needed the help of someone. She had to have him, even if it was just in her head.</p> <p>"I have to have you. I might never be able to get another car."</p> <p>"That's the last time I'll ever get my car. I can't keep it. Now you better find me nice and ready to go. You might get your car back sooner than you think," he said while looking Sally up and down.</p> <p>Sally looked down at her hand which was resting on his forearm. She didn't want him to stop. There was nothing stopping her.</p> <p>"Are you sure we need to go, after I tell Mom and Dad." She looked at him but didn't want to run away from him. Her heart was pounding so fast.</p> <p>"Don't worry. We'll be safe. I'll buy you a car. You can buy a car for yourself. You wouldn't run away from me again," he said while reaching out and pushing her hand away.</p> <p>"No, we have to go. This is my home and my mom can't get away from me until I tell her," she said while looking around.</p> <p>Sally could hear her parents in the distance talking to each other at the mall. They were walking home. They talked to each other too. At the mall their conversation always left Sally with nothing. The salesman said to her that he wanted to talk to her at school. He had been working a deal for the summer for money. Now he had enough to buy Sally a car.</p> <p>As they turned onto to drive Sally noticed the door handle on her car was out. She couldn't believe she had just been fucked by someone so young. She couldnâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
