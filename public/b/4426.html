She asked softly.</p> <p>Kendra reached out to him, her smile was genuine, and it broke his heart to see her smile. "No, not me. You, Sir."</p> <p>"I thought your Master's instructions might be different." He smiled.</p> <p>"I, Sir?" Her smile got wider, she was blushing.</p> <p>"You know better than I do yet. You know you don't want this, don't want our relationship to end." He smiled down at her. "We can make a deal."</p> <p>"I have feelings?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>She was looking him right in the eyes. "I think I do."</p> <p>"I know you do. Have I told you how beautiful you are?" He smiled, the question had never come from her before.</p> <p>"I can't say I care, but I don't like to give in so easily," she added.</p> <p>"I know. It will seem silly to be upset if I feel you hurt when you hurt."</p> <p>"That's a silly idea Sir. Your actions may be what would hurt you more. We have to leave if you aren't happy." She grinned.</p> <p>"Yes, I am happy Sir...but, you'll have to forgive me, for a week, I'll find out."</p> <p>"When this is over?"</p> <p>"You do nothing but let me do this. I can do it my way Sir." She smiled sweetly back up at him. "So much better. Can we meet after dark? I could use a bath and a nice meal Sir."</p> <p>"I will think about your offer." He smiled again and kissed her lightly on the mouth.</p> <p>"Good night, Sir."</p> <p>Kendra was looking forward to spending her night with Sir. She had never been with anyone before, and it surprised her, but she enjoyed her time with Sir. He had grown to take great pleasure in her company, and she liked to be with him, being in his presence. She wondered if he had felt the same way. She was excited, and wished he could feel the same. She knew it was wrong, but it felt so good to be his. She didn't know how to explain this, but somehow, it felt right for her to feel his love for her. "Go home, and make me a nice bed." She said softly, walking out to the porch. She had only been here a few hours, but this felt like a very long time. They had talked about such things, and she couldn't wait to tell him. It's hard to explain now. It was hard on her mind, but it felt good to feel him in her arms.</p> <p>She had the day off to herself, and decided she would find someone to hang out with when they arrived. She had just finished a bottle of wine with the rest of them, and wanted to make sure they had everything ready for dinner. "Where do you want to go?" She asked.</p> <p>"You'll see." He stood and held his hand out to her. "Let's go see my car." She didn't protest, they had been friends the longest. She wasn't a social person, either.</p> <p>Kendra went to change into her night shirt, and slipped in to use the restroom. While doing so, she heard Master's footsteps on the stairs, and she smiled to herself imagining his eyes on her. Kendra thought about his mouth on hers, and her nipples stiffened against the cloth at the same time as her stomach muscles contracted. "Hurry up." She whispered. She grabbed her things and hurried up to her room. She knew he would be waiting.</p> <p>It took about thirty minutes, but finally she saw his car pull up. She got dressed, and went to meet him at the top of the stairs. She was glad to see that it was early, not too early. He had already seen her outfit, and she liked that she had something new on underneath. She smiled and gave him a peck, and he got into his car. He took an extra breath, he looked amazing. The wind had gotten heavier by the minute, and she liked the feeling of being so close to him. As she watched him drive away from the house, she got goosebumps. Her nipples began to ache. This was turning into a great evening.</p> <p>She was about to go up to bed with her thoughts of her Master going through her brain when he stopped his car. "Kendra, I was a little scared." He put some clothes on and started up the stairs. Kendra slipped out the door and headed toward her room. She could see his reflection in the mirror hanging on the door of her room. He looked up and smiled. He looked like a very happy man. It was thatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
