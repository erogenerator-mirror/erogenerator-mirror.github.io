It really didn't matter. They were on a slippery slope and it never stopped coming. The water at the shore was the only possible place they could have gone.</p> <p>"No... no..." She had to say it. It was time for some real passion. "Please.... Please put that inside me... I want to feel it inside...."</p> <p>He took the sponge and lubed it. His rigid staff felt wonderful as she guided it toward her opening.</p> <p>"Not yet..." she gasped. "Just move gently..." Her voice was husky with lust.</p> <p>After a few seconds, the head slipped to her tight opening and she felt the head of his prick sliding past her labia. As she felt the softness of the sponge on her lips, she felt his shaft opening her up. The head was suddenly inside and, for some reason, he was moving back. She heard him grunt as he drove the shaft more fully into her. Soon it was nestled in her tight channel. His hands were around her waist.</p> <p>"Ahhhh..." she whispered. "Please.... "</p> <p>She felt him move, lifting her slightly. Slowly he pulled. The sponge still rested against her lips. He was fucking her. His prick was sliding in and out of her tight channel.</p> <p>"Yes...." she groaned. "Yes.... yes..."</p> <p>He was fucking her hard now. She couldn't move. His hands were tight at her waist and he was gripping her firmly. They stayed like that for a long time, holding each other. Then he slowly pulled her back toward him, fully out of her. When he was almost out, she felt him slide back inside her again.</p> <p>"Ah!" she said softly. "I'm going to come again!"</p> <p>He continued, his shaft rubbing against her clit as he slammed into her again. After a few moments, he stopped and she felt the hot spasm of his prick as it erupted.</p> <p>"Unnnnnggh!" It felt like it was in her belly.</p> <p>Her own body reacted, writhing under his control.</p> <p>"Yes..." She felt him withdraw a little. "Push against me... "</p> <p>Again he drove his rigid shaft deep in her.</p> <p>"Yes... like that..."</p> <p>He moved very slowly now, keeping his pace. Her legs were still wide apart and he could feel his prick probing the walls of her vagina. Every little movement drove him deeper in her.</p> <p>"Unnnn.... Ahhhh.... " She clutched him tight.</p> <p>"Ohhhh.... Ohhhhh!" She held him. "Do it...." She could feel his prick pulse as it throbbed.</p> <p>"Ahhhh.... I'm........" She could feel his juices coating their bodies. She knew he was filling her.</p> <p>He was still for a while. Eventually, her legs gave way. He stopped and she could feel his cock slipping out of her.</p> <p>"Not yet," she groaned. "Please."</p> <p>He rolled off her and lay on his back with his arms behind his head.</p> <p>"You're so beautiful," he said. She could feel his mouth covering hers as he kissed her deeply.</p> <p>With her knees wide apart, she kissed him with everything she had left in her. He touched her face, neck, breasts, anywhere he could reach. They were warm and soft. So soft... so inviting. Their tongues danced in each other's mouths. They were breathing hard. Their hands moved up and down each other's body. She ran fingertips on his chest. In his arms.</p> <p>"Mmmmm.... You have such a beautiful body." He said and cupped her right breast.</p> <p>"Thank you...." she replied.</p> <p>"I think you were right." He looked at her with wonder.</p> <p>"Yes.... " she said and touched his chest.</p> <p>They lay there, kissing and touching each other. It was the first time they had ever been together. The feelings were electric. As though sparks were running across their skin. It was too much. They were lost in the moment.</p> <p>"So tell me about your family....</p> <p>"Are you sure you want to be with me? " she said it slowly.</p> <p>"Yes." He stroked her face. "I want to tell you everything.... Please..."</p> <p>She felt him move up the side of the bed and then she felt him lie on his back. Slowly he opened her legs.</p> <p>She felt him move between them. Then slowly he moved in.</p> <p>"Ahâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
