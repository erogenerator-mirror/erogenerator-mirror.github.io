I knew what I could do. There wasn't a lot of scope to deal with on this issue. My cock and my nuts were very tight and I wasn't going to be able to hold out for very long...not with that kind of stimulation. I also knew that after my initial orgasm I may need to slow down if it was all going well.</p> <p>As if understanding my thoughts, Karen opened herself to my cock. She didn't take it all the way in. She wanted what she felt and was waiting for me to make her cum. It was something I had never thought about but now I understood why others always want something bigger.</p> <p>I thought about getting more aggressive. I started to push back into her as I tried to control the length and girth of my cock. She was holding me tight as she rubbed her clit and her tits against my chest, her head tilted back slightly. She continued to fuck herself against me with the vibrator that she used to stimulate herself. Our eyes met; I saw her smile and look into my eyes. It happened over a few seconds later and we both experienced what it felt like for a woman. My cock pulsed and I tried to keep up with her motion as we came. It was an intense climax. I felt her cum against me as we came for what seemed like minutes.</p> <p>When it was over, we both collapsed in between her legs and lay there on top of each other with her pussy resting on my leg. I could feel how sensitive her pussy had become and how I was able to keep hard and still fuck her. I slowly pulled out of her and let her legs hang open. I looked down at her and could see our cum dripping off of her. I also looked at her tits hanging down below her. There were beads of cum hanging down on her chest as well. I leaned over, my cock still at about half mast, and rested my head on her breast. I felt her breathe in her breast and could still taste the saltiness of our cum. I ran my fingers through the mess between her tits as if she were a little girl.</p> <p>Just then, I felt Karen's foot come down on the couch she was on. She pushed into my side briefly just to hold my weight. She leaned forward and placed her cheek on my chest. We lay like that for a moment, letting our breathing slowly return to normal. Karen pulled herself up and off of me and I rolled over so I was on my back. Karen crawled up my body until her pussy was a few inches in front of my face. She pulled on me some so she could continue where she left off. I opened wide and placed her pussy right in front of my mouth, feeling her weight and having her hot pussy on my lips. I tasted our combined juices that we had deposited for the first time. I was able to get some with my tongue and I did have more of my own on my cheeks. She started to work on my cock, sliding up and down it. I loved how wet she was and it was taking everything I had all day to stop her from going any further down on me. I could taste my own cum all over my tongue. This was making me so close to cumming at this point.</p> <p>She slid down farther and lay on top of me, our breasts meeting at our sides. Our legs were intertwined. She reached between us and ran her fingers along my cock and balls. She ran her fingers back and forth along me and over my mouth. We were looking into each other's eyes. Her lips were only a few inches from mine. Her long hair framed her face and let me look at her as she looked back at me. She whispered that she could not feel anything other than the wonderful feel of my cock between her legs. Her pussy was still a little damp from being between my legs but the feel of it was the same. After what she had felt earlier, we had only been doing this if I was willing to do it for her. I felt myself get harder and I told her that I would never cum without touching her. I told her I wanted to feel her cum on my cock. I told her I knew she would. She told me she was willing to do this for me. She told me that she loved how it felt to be wanted. I felt my cock pulse in her hand as it shot load after load of cum. She smiled and said that she didn't know if she would like it or not. We kissed as I rested my head on her shoulder.</p> <p>After our kiss she continued to stroke me. As hard and fast she could, she slid one of my balls in her mouth and held them for a second. I felt my cock spasm each time she closed her hand over it. She then slowly took the other ball out of her mouth and held it in her index finger. She then slid it back around myâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
