And then I would get cold.</p> <p>"Don't tell anyone. Just give me the chance to be alone with you and maybe make one wish. I can't have your baby." I had to feel that little voice cry inside my head saying that. I told myself that there is no hope of us doing it.</p> <p>"I can't. I'm too sensitive and nervous. I need to lie down." Was that one of my more pressing concerns? Why would anyone feel the need to lie down like this?</p> <p>With him holding me as I fell asleep and me breathing slowly I realized that even though I was now completely awake, there was the need to wake myself up. I wanted to hold him. I wanted him to hold me. I wanted to wake him.</p> <p>I opened my eyes and found that his face was almost touching mine. I felt the warmth, the softness of his arm that I had fallen asleep with. Then I realized that we must be quiet. What was I thinking? Why are the other people in the room just staring at us? It's been over ten years since anything had happened between us. He's not here but I feel his hand on my forehead and his hair tickling my cheek. I look at him and in a soft voice I say, "I'm not done with you." And I kiss him on the lips.</p> <p>Chapter 4</p> <p>We didn't have sex. The night of my honeymoon. I got off work around seven and my husband's father called me in to work at ten so that he could pick my bags out for me. I think that I had been crying as was always the way he looked at me after I'd left home.</p> <p>My parents weren't home so we had the whole week to ourselves. My brother David picked me up and I was off for a few hours to visit some friends in town. All that was left were some of my favorite places to go with him. I've been to the beach a couple of times before but he always came to me after school and we took turns playing in the sand while everyone else was out shopping.</p> <p>As we drove out of town, I was just thinking of David's father again. I couldn't remember how. It took everything I had to get there but I remembered what daddy had said. We wouldn't have been at the beach long because I was too worn out. I wondered what David must have felt like if it happened. If he was happy with me. I thought I felt the same way about David as I did about him. I didn't know if I could live with myself if we didn't do this. Then I looked at him as we walked.</p> <p>He looked at me and that confused the hell out of me. I felt that he didn't want me. David wanted me enough that the worst was about to happen.</p> <p>We had to leave. We needed to find him when we found him. My heart sank as he was right behind us on the way to pick me up. We had a long drive that evening.</p> <p>When I climbed from the back seat I found that David was smiling as he looked at me. "You were so scared!" David said as he kissed my cheek.</p> <p>"I'm not sure I can take this without you." He kissed my forehead and then our lips met again. I wanted to resist but we made the drive like two teenagers in love exploring one another's body. I wanted to kiss him until his hands explored my naked flesh, until his tongue slipped into my mouth. I was so excited and yet so timid as I stepped from my seat and got down on the ground.</p> <p>"Let's go."</p> <p>I didn't understand what I expected. I thought that I would be sitting side by side at lunch or with David's father to be around long after I'd gone to sleep. I wasn't sure until I saw the car and the back of the men in the back seat that I was supposed to get my night clothes on before we left. The car looked as though the back door was sliding open and the front seat was moving out and down to my side. The guy seemed to be pulling something out but I couldn't tell if it was David or one of the men. Then the car started to move. The driver started the car and the door slid open.</p> <p>I stood frozen in his arms. His lips were on mine. I just stood there like a deer as my heart pounded in my chest. When I looked up at the man sitting in the front seat I recognized David's father and there was a huge grin on his face as he watched me get into the car.</p> <p>David and the driver walked around the car and openedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
