"Hello" His voice doesn't reveal any emotion he may have. He looks back into her eyes, which now seem to be filled.</p> <p>He can't read her face any more. For a moment, he's completely confused.</p> <p>"I'm sorry." He feels like he's just broken up. But she responds. She doesn't feel sorry, she feels like she's done the world a favor. He hopes he can make it up to her.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, too."</p> <p>A slow smile creeps over her face and he can't help but be thankful that she's okay. Not because she is, or because he's being a dick. He hopes that she will make it up to her, too.</p> <p>"I'm leaving now." He leans his forehead to hers and she can smell herself on his face, as they lean in and kiss each other on the lips gently. His tongue slips into her mouth to explore and it seems that she feels for him like she does for him. The kiss goes on while his arms go around her waist. Soon they're both breathing harder and he begins to work her hips. She slides down against him and can feel his cock pushing against her. They kiss passionately, letting their lust fill their small spaces. Their hands and legs intertwine and rub and explore with want. They grind their hips hard at one another. He's feeling the fullness of her round ass and has the urge to squeeze it.</p> <p>"I don't know about you... but I need to go."</p> <p>"Well. You just had the most amazing sex for the first time." He gives her a half smile and she can feel his arms tightening around her waist and pull her back against him, as he begins to press himself into her. She can feel his cock start to push into her as she grinds her hips against him, and she smiles with her mouth full of hot, black mouth.</p> <p>"Is that what you call foreplay? I told you I wasn't looking forward to this... so lets just get it over with." She reaches into his pants and pulls out his hard cock.</p> <p>"Mmmm. It's just not the same without you. You're a dirty little whore that just needs to get fucked." She strokes his cock and takes his balls in her mouth, sucking hard on them while keeping one hand on his ass. He shivers as she does this, wanting this for her to last forever. She kisses his chest again while kissing her way down the line of his ribs and bites each one gently. He moans as she bites each one and pushes him back against the bedroom wall. He wraps his strong leg around her and she begins to grind against him, his cock is now hard against her as she moves up and down it.</p> <p>"Don't cum... please, not another second." she kisses him on his neck as she starts to slide up and down his shaft again. His moans of pleasure vibrate into her mouth and she can feel his cock throbbing inside her. She can feel his cock swelling and pulsing as this time she feels him filling her and she closes her eyes and rides him hard. When she reaches her goal, her eyes roll back and she feels her own orgasm begin to overtake this one.</p> <p>"Oh God.... You're coming for me..." She releases her grip on his ass and begins to move herself up and down on his cock even faster. She looks into his eyes as she moves her mouth up and down, fucking his shaft with a tight, tightness. He knows he's going to come again soon.</p> <p>"Oh God, I'm going to come..." she can feel his balls tightening as he tries to hold off while she grinds herself into his cock.</p> <p>"Keep going... I'm near." His cock begins to spurt out ropes of hot cum onto her pussy as she grinds herself against his cock.</p> <p>"Hoo-ha!" she moaned as he thrust himself into her with a final thrust and she starts to come down from her intense orgasm. She slides off of him and stands up; she grabs his cock with her hand and pulls him up and into her, he starts on top of her and they kiss passionately until she's breathless from the force of his orgasm. He continues to thrust himself into her and she wraps her legs around him while feeling his cock as it slips back inside her. She smiles up at him and he kisses her lips while lifting himself up and pushing himself in and out of her. She can feel him go balls deep inside her and she lifts her hips to meet him. Her hands rub her breasts as she feels his mouth on her neck and she moans as their bodies move together.</p> <p>"Let me make you cum again." He reaches his hands up to her breasts fromâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
