Oh. I'm cummmmmmming!"</p> <p>Saying that, the second orgasm took her over for a second, as her pussy spasmed and her legs shook.</p> <p>"Ahh, ahhh!" She yelled at the top of her lungs, her face buried in her shirt as she held on for dear life, as she rode out yet another, almost simultaneous, orgasm, her back arching as she shook on top of me, then slowly relaxing as she laid there, panting for air, her lips still in a pucker of pain, the sweat running down from both of us. She opened her eyes and looked up at me as she smiled a weak smile.</p> <p>"I'm so happy. Thank you. We must do this again sometime. We made a baby. I felt great. Thanks."</p> <p>"No. That's none of your business. You're my son-in-law. You shouldn't be doing that. We got married for Christ sake, but she doesn't know about it yet." I told her. Looking at her we smiled at each other then reached for each other, feeling our souls come alive together. We held onto each other for dear life, our hearts beating as we kissed each other deeply as we slowly started to breathe.</p> <p>"No honey. Let's go. Let's go home, cuz you still have a lot more to go home with. It has been a while."</p> <p>As this thought crossed her mind and she looked me in the eyes, her smile faded into a smile.</p> <p>"Ok, honey. Just give me a minute, then let's go."</p> <p>In a few minutes, we were dressed, kissed, and headed out to her car. As I reached for the door handle as I walked her down the steps, she quickly turned around and gave me a kiss full on my lips.</p> <p>"You just better hold on to your wife. I won't be long, but I do want you."</p> <p>"Okâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
