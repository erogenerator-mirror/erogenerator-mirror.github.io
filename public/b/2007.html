Kaitlin gave Tami her keys and a pen to sign as she went to retrieve her keys, she sat down to wait for an answer.</p> <p>"She's so nice, that's for sure"</p> <p>"Well I feel sorry for her, she was a cute little thing but I didn't know if she was even real!"</p> <p>Tami shook her head, "Tall is good, she still needs it, I can't believe she let anyone else take care of it"</p> <p>Kaitlin took the pen from Tami and put it to her lips and nodded, they began their day and Kaitlin knew it would be her life.</p> <p>-----------------------------------------</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>She stepped out of the elevator and headed towards the office parking lot, she had a feeling there would be a lot of people waiting for her there. As she approached Jorgon's office building she saw the sign that read 'Custody'. That sign made her shiver and she felt a rush of adrenaline flow into her. Not only was she anxious to get out of there, but this place was a lot of fun. As she stepped inside the building and walked up the escalator to the floor she noticed that there were a lot of people waiting for the elevator. She began jogging towards the entrance and noticed that Jorgon's place wasn't far. She turned around and started jogging up the stairs to find that the lobby area was empty.</p> <p>"Damn, why is there so many people? The elevator is all yours!"</p> <p>She smiled to herself, not wanting to disturb anyone waiting for the elevator but, what the hell, it was just too weird. She went over to a table and ordered some burgers, fries and a salad.</p> <p>After waiting a few minutes, Kaitlin grabbed the paper off of the table. She had just had lunch once when there was a knock on the door. Kaitlin opened the door and a dark, black man entered, and walked in.</p> <p>"Good morning, how are you Kaitlin?"</p> <p>She shook the burger out onto the plate and looked to the man she had just met, the smell of it was so strong that she couldn't take her eyes off it.</p> <p>"I'm Kaitlin by the way, Kaitlin"</p> <p>Tami nodded.</p> <p>"Oh sorry I didn't know you had lunch with her!"</p> <p>"Don't worry about it, it's not that kind of visit, he had some news that he hadn't told you."</p> <p>Kaitlin nodded again wondering why the man hadn't told her he didn't own a cell phone.</p> <p>"What type of news are you?"</p> <p>"Oh, it has to do with the FBI, the CIA and the FBI."</p> <p>"Ah, and what kind of information did you have that I didn't have?"</p> <p>Tami shook her head, "I had that report for a friend of mine, and here you are, with our help."</p> <p>Kaitlin looked at her and frowned, "Well, where are my lunch, you can get it, my friend is busy!"</p> <p>Tami shook her head in disbelief, but Kaitlin said, "Look, I'm not kidding, we're in an area that's mostly men. You could even see us going past each other."</p> <p>Tami nodded.</p> <p>The man looked over at both of them as they walked through the lobby doors. He stood and then began approaching them slowly, Kaitlin followed. After a brief conversation, Tami said, "My friend is out of town this summer, she has some meetings with friends and that's why she'll be in Vegas this weekend."</p> <p>After saying that, the man turned to the next two people. He began talking in low, low tones.</p> <p>"We're here to pick up some of your clientele, I'm not exactly a stranger to dealing with this area, but here's the thing, your clientele is a lot of women and we've just picked up these two."</p> <p>As he spoke, Kaitlin thought he had moved on to a woman?
