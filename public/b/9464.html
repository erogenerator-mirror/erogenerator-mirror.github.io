I had to be alone so I moved toward him. I pulled his coat off his muscular shoulders. It was buttoned very tight and came down to just below his waist. He was barefoot and I pushed it back again in a single motion and he fell backwards on the hard wooden seat. The whole time we were going through this the waiter was staring at my tits and his cock was standing fully erect in front of me. He couldn't even take his eyes over me in our state of undress. He could have done with a few drinks on his way into the bar.</p> <p>I grabbed his hair and pulled my mouth toward his, I wanted to kiss him so badly but I could still feel our lips pressing hard together. My tongue was flicking inside his mouth as he pushed his tongue into mine. I could feel the silkiness of his lips against mine and suddenly all those things that we fantasize about in bed were being pushed together by our kisses.</p> <p>The waiter sat back in the chair with his eyes fixed on me and a huge bulge was growing in his lap. The waiter's eyes followed our hands as we stood and walked towards a large booth along the wall of the bar. We had been standing there more than the table itself. I reached one hand down toward his crotch and I felt an almost audible gasp from him. His cock was almost fully erect and was hanging down a little further down his leg than I thought it was possible to get the head out of. I had to have him. I was afraid that he wouldn't make the first move. It didn't get any better after I put the coat back on. I sat down on the cold leather bench and put his legs through mine. I spread them as far apart as I could. I could even feel little goose bumps on his legs as I began to slowly roll my hand up and down over them.</p> <p>I was getting wet from the heat of our bodies and the friction I was applying to him, he really was a hunk. I felt his cock begin to twitch and harden. He began to moan and I knew it was making me even hungrier for him. My pussy had never felt this hot for someone other than my husband and I began to squeeze and massage his balls. With his back arched he was lifting his hips, pushing his cock up toward me. The waiter began to unbutton his coat and pulled it off over his head.</p> <p>We had never gone anywhere without having sex. Ever. It was just sex when you don't make it last. I was getting very hot by this point and I knew my own would become even hotter. I had one arm on the back of the bench, the other on his chest and I had my hand on his cock under the table. He pushed his tongue into my mouth and I sucked on it, enjoying the feel of the hard bulge in his pants. I felt his cock swell and start to jump.</p> <p>I could see that our waiter had not even noticed this. My hand was wrapped around it, stroking up and down. The waiter's eyes were now wide with desire. The waiter had no control over his own body. I could feel the bulge beginning to flex.</p> <p>He leaned over farther and began to kiss me again. I pulled his lips tighter to mine and started to suck on his tongue. We could hardly breathe now as our mouths worked together. I let out a low groan that only our mouths could manage and let go my hand to stroke his cock. He grabbed my ass and we both lifted as high off the table.</p> <p>The waiter had managed to unbutton his shirt the rest of the way and I could feel his hard chest on my bare tits against my nipples. The waiter's hand had moved back up to my ass and was sliding its way through my skirt. His fingers began to gently trace the curve of my pussy through my thong as the waiter's fingers began to explore my pussy. They began with a light tease, first touching my clit, but then moving inward to push against my pussy. I was already so wet that they were slipping right in. He let both of his hands slide into my waistband a bit and slowly pulled my thong down. I lifted a leg and it was now inching its way down my thigh. The waiter's hands were now exploring my pussy. Up and down, side to side, with a little more pressure each time.</p> <p>I wanted to make him cum so bad just from what the waiter was doing to me. Even though I was in heat from his kisses all I thought about was getting him off. I slid my own top and bra off and threw them on the floor. The waiter was breathing hard now. He was panting as I began to rub his crotch. He moaned with pleasure and began to lift his hips so I could remove his pants and shortsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
