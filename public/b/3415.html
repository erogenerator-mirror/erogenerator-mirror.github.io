But please be gentle."</p> <p>"I will."</p> <p>The night was spent with a steady build up of arousal. I wasn't too tired that night and was happy that my little encounter with a girl had sparked some chemistry with him. We never got a real chance to meet and I ended up having to go out with an old friend once in a while. The relationship wasn't too bad, if you're interested in having a sex affair with someone in the same room as you, then this is the place to think about it.</p> <p>"So did you like your night with me?" It was an opportunity to gauge if he remembered me, I never liked to be the center of attention in a meeting. I had had many girlfriends and he always came in behind me and made advances; it was a different business. I didn't like the attention I got from other men. I also learned that they came in early too fast, I could always go back to my regular clients, which is not ideal so that I couldn't look to much of anything except for one person. He was not the typical man I had been with before and I felt like I could learn something from this. He was an intelligent conversationalist and he could get people to do what he wanted them to do and it didn't get me a lot of experience to learn. So I made my move though a little more conservatively.</p> <p>"The best way to get a girl's attention is to get her to go for you. She'll never forget you again."</p> <p>"I don't know about that, I don't think I have had that experience since high school but I might want to try it again sometime. I'm afraid that it would be the wrong thing to take so slowly." Not being one to let a guy down I gave up trying this game with him. The guy just seemed to have a way of getting my attention and I was pleased, this might mean a change in my life for the better. If I went back to his dorm with a guy he would be easy on me and there was only one way to go.</p> <p>"So am I being too forward here?" I had already decided that I didn't want to push him further into it now. Maybe it had been the wrong thing to say but I had a hard time getting it out.</p> <p>"No, I mean it's like this. You remember me, well I think I need to have a relationship. I didn't think that was really necessary but the idea of actually having sex with you has made me hard for the last few months."</p> <p>"Oh no! I'm sorry, it's just that the idea of making you make you hard. You're not hard right now, how hard would you be?"</p> <p>"I just thought it was because I'm in a hurry and you didn't think I would ever get you any action."</p> <p>"Maybe I don't even have that kind of feeling."</p> <p>"You might have noticed that I have been making little comments about a girl at high school."</p> <p>"I didn't mean I was making fun of you. I just thought it was a bit sudden."</p> <p>"No, you didn't offend me by saying that. When I was with you we had the hottest time. A girl has to let a guy into her mouth so that the boy can get his rocks off." Now I had to remember to say something to give the confidence I thought I had before. Maybe that helped me get things going. "Are you sure you want to go through with this?"</p> <p>"I'm sure. Are you offering me oral sex and then getting back at me?"</p> <p>"I want you to do what ever you feel you want to with me and have sex with me. But to be honest, I'm not sure I can come out of these things."</p> <p>I'm not sure I wanted to go through with this but he wasn't going to object. My mind could not get involved in the discussion but I couldn't help myself from being flirty with him. It was good for me to be noticed by him, and from the look on his face it wasn't going to ruin our friendship either. After all, he would probably have an erection if I had kept going. I was a virgin, but if I had to go through with this that was the furthest thing from my mind.</p> <p>My decision was made and I stood up and started to leave the room. However there was no way I could walk over here, so I leaned in to him.</p> <p>"May I kiss you? Can my lips feel you against mine?"</p> <p>The kiss sent shivers up my spine, but it left me breathless and eager. He was not as good, but the feel of his lipsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
