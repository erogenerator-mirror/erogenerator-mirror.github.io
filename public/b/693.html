Don't make me do it."</p> <p>She did, with a slight hesitation, but nonetheless, she did, and this time not as I expected her to, but as I could read she placed her lips to me for a soft kiss. Our tongues did their work for a brief moment, but not the whole time. We were kissing just one woman, a woman who had never had a man, a woman who had once been to bed with some one else for that matter and I had made her love a man as I had her loved another, but she had never allowed another man to bring pleasure to her other than by giving her to someone but I had.</p> <p>When our kiss broke, I was amazed at my own power. I had made her moan and cry because I had done this, that she had done this because I had made her do something not just because I had been pleased with her, but because I had made her do it. But I would do anything for her and she never looked at me as though I was the woman who did her husband-to-be's pleasure instead. I watched as my hand stroked her face and through her hair.</p> <p>She was still holding her breath and then I had her lean back against the table and her knees were still to my sides and the sight of her body and her mouth made mine quiver. I could see her lips part and her tongue darting out to taste herself. I had wanted to kiss her but had never dared do so, and when she had finally made it that last time, I was afraid she would refuse me again, if only I could make her submit herself to me. She had done it this time, of course, and though the way the women of the neighborhood would have made out was wrong, the man in her made it possible for her to do whatever she wanted, including suck a man's cock. She was my one and only, but I had made her do that so long it seemed she might do something like that with any man; that I could let her do anything except do it to me, any man, which meant no pussy-licking or no fisting in any man's or woman's vagina.</p> <p>It seemed like time stood still, it was like she became one person and a part of my world, not just a thing I had dreamed of. Time had ceased to exist. It was as I held her hands and looked into her eyes and her body was beginning to tremble and then that shaking began deep within her. She was making soft, whimpering movements against my chest and I felt her arms go around me. Her hips began to move against my cock in a slow, fluid motion that reminded me a woman's first dance, and that made my manhood begin to swell.</p> <p>By now we were kissing as well as our hands had found and it took no time at all for my hand to find her pussy. It was wet and engorged and warm with desire and just the touch of my fingers to the place between her lips was enough to drive her over the edge. I had to have her, I needed her so bad. I had to.</p> <p>I ran my fingers over her folds, caressing the outer lips, opening her slit, taking a little of her moisture and putting two or three inside, but she cried out and went rigid again. I moved my fingers back to her clit and used my thumb to rub it.</p> <p>"Yes! Oh, please!" she cried, "I like this! It's been too long! Make me cum!"</p> <p>Her words were like a chant and I thought she was just making one to me with her words. She was going to make it again.</p> <p>I ran my fingers from her clit upward and then back down, back to where I had been inside her just moments ago, and when I touched her again, still not a moan by any means, "Do ye want to make me cum, baby?"</p> <p>"Yes! I want to make you cum!"</p> <p>"What do you want, I know you! I will do anything for you!"</p> <p>"Oh, yes! Anything!"</p> <p>I looked up at her, which seemed only natural, she was mine, hers to do with however she wanted to.</p> <p>"Come over here and kiss me."</p> <p>She stood up, slowly, almost sexily, and I did, as though she were just an object just for me to hold for my own pleasure, something else to do just for me.</p> <p>After she had me again, she started on my cock again, using my lips to get my head up into her mouth, but not being able to concentrate on what she was doing but enjoying every second which made my head ache for her to take meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
