She didn't have a lot of hair. But he liked how her pussy lips were shaved so his fingers were rubbing it. She was so wet that his fingers slid easily inside her and she moaned again.</p> <p>After two or three minutes, his fingers slid out and she immediately sat up. A shiver ran through her body, but she wasn't ready to move. She kissed his fingers, licked them and got up again.</p> <p>She took his hand and led him to the shower. They stepped in and washed each other's hair. It was getting hot, soapy hands rubbed against each other as they washed and rinsed each other's long hair.</p> <p>When they were done, they stepped out and dried their hair in the bathroom mirror as they kissed, and headed to bed.</p> <p>Their hands touched again as they fell on the sheets. She pulled his body against her as her hand slid over his cock.</p> <p>"You know, you shouldn't ask that if he's on the other hand," she said. She knew he was lying. But she was going to try anyway. She slid it against her pussy lips as she began to move. When he began to move, she stopped him.</p> <p>"I'm afraid," she said as she rolled over and he entered her.</p> <p>It was the most wonderful thing he had ever ever felt and she began to move against him while he fucked the hell out of her. It was so much better than his little finger. He hadn't felt anything like it in years.</p> <p>She was breathing heavily and her legs were pressed against her tits. This time, they were moving their entire bodies, thrusting and squeezing along his cock.</p> <p>"I'll just sit here and watch," she said, "and get lost in it. I'll do anything you want." She slid one hand to hold his cock tightly while his shaft rubbed against her clit against both of their bodies.</p> <p>The two of them lay there, their bodies rubbing against one another as she held him close. With each thrust, her body and nipples rubbed against his body. Her hands on his chest, pressing hard against every part of his body, he began to feel his cock rub against her clit, feeling it move as its tip pushed and slid through her wet lips.</p> <p>"You're so hard!" she said. She closed her eyes and began to arch herself toward him like she did earlier. The contact with his cock felt great on his body. She wanted to cum so bad, but he was still fucking her. For some reason, it felt great to make love to another person that way.</p> <p>Suddenly, his shaft was inside her, pushing and rubbing her clit.</p> <p>"Oh, I'm cumming," she told him.</p> <p>He pushed inside and came with her. She lay there, still gripping his cock while he was still pumping inside her. She didn't mind the feeling of his cock, no matter how small, inside of her. It didn't take long until they both came together.</p> <p>She was so weak laying there, so turned on, so ready for sex. She felt him fall on her side and she felt his leg against hers. Her whole body felt like it was on fire. She could actually feel her pussy throbbing, and she knew that from that moment, she would want to make love again.</p> <p>"I didn't think I could cum with you," she said.</p> <p>"Me either," he said as he kissed her.</p> <p>He couldn't believe how good it all felt, and so intense when he was with her. He wanted to make love to her again every day.</p> <p>He rolled over and they lay there facing each other. He cupped her face in his hand and pulled her to him.</p> <p>She put her arms around his neck and held onto him. He didn't know how it could be any better than what it was like, but he was feeling a different way, than he did anything elseâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
