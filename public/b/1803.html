It's from here." He pointed to the other photo, the one where an older man sat on a bed and the woman lay naked, her back arched, her hands fisted in the hair that was spread out over the duvet, her body trembling, her chest rising and falling with desire as she panted, her long black hair cascading from the corner of her face. "Come up and take a look. I'll get us some lunch."</p> <p>It took him ten minutes to make lunch, a delicious and pleasant meal, and he took time out to enjoy the memory of the woman lying in front of him, the soft, smooth skin of her sex just as smooth as hers, her skin tight and flawless, the pale body smooth as silk under his eye and eyes.</p> <p>They spent some time talking - with more of the same conversation than they'd had in years, their bodies communicating the words of the other while their minds and souls played over her face and down her slender neck. They came to understand that her skin was smooth and that she was a natural-looking woman.</p> <p>Before he left for home, he arranged himself an empty hotel, and sent the following photos he'd prepared to send to her:</p> <p>From the beginning:</p> <p>To start with:</p> <p>"Well...you look good." The words left him a little breathless - he'd been hard all day on the phone, the sight of the photo gave him ideas.</p> <p>"Might I ask if you would like to see me take it off?" She hesitated - she liked to take off her clothes, and he liked to see her naked too, he could see her nipples through her blouse, the small triangle of her pubic hair just visible through the thin material of her skirt.</p> <p>"Come and see." He waited for the hesitation to die on her expression, the hesitation to go the next step.</p> <p>She didn't move, he could imagine that she was looking a little scared and scared yet turned on, it was all very sexy, he couldn't describe it to her. But as her eyes slowly returned to his face, he could see a glimmer between her legs.</p> <p>"You like that don't you?" He laughed, and with one hand, the other slipped to her skirt, pulling it up as he did.</p> <p>"I like that a lot." He took another photograph.</p> <p>"It's hot in here isn't it? Does that turn you on?"</p> <p>"Yes. And it's hard for me to look at you, and I like doing it in the dark."</p> <p>"Yeah, that's fun. But I like being watched too, do you want to watch me with my clothes on?"</p> <p>"Yes." He moved in front of her to kiss her - she could still see that he was breathing, could still feel the tension in the room.</p> <p>"Why don't you get the camera, it won't hurt, you can play with me again later tonight."</p> <p>"You'd feel a little different if I had you inside me." He smiled as he saw the hesitation on her face.</p> <p>She was looking at the camera, and then to the lens, and then back at his eyes.</p> <p>"Can you take some more?"</p> <p>"Would you help me with it for me?"</p> <p>"I could try." She smiled. "I'll start it off." She leaned back, resting her hand on the side of the bed, a little nervous. He got a little more daring, and got his other hand into the middle of her back, his middle finger just barely sliding inside the fabric of her thong, teasing her as he slid her thong down her legs from behind. She took a deep breath of that and let it. She took his hand, then his fingers, holding it there for a moment while the camera played on that first picture, before she leaned back again, her eyes closed again as she took more still, taking more pictures of herself in the mirror.</p> <p>"Will you join me?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"But let me know what you want first."</p> <p>He waited to hear her reply, and when she did, he moved the camera down to her feet, and she could see him move it from her hands to her legs, a flash of lust and desire in his eyes as he looked at her, then back up at him, her hands on her hips. When she finally spoke, she breathed heavily, "Ok."</p> <p>Taking his hand again, he pulled himself up on his elbows and his eyes dropped to the floor, but the image in front of him looked so close to him - so real that, even though the camera was still trained on her, all of her body was focused on that man's gaze.</p> <p>He slowly unzippedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
