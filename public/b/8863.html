After a few minutes, and after I had been watching her getting fucked, I had to agree. She had a point. I decided to go for broke.</p> <p>As we were finishing up the cleaning up, I said, "Geez, you're a beautiful creature. You've become very, very desirable to me."</p> <p>"Thank you, sir. I'm sorry. I guess we had better talk about this more," she said, holding on to me some more. "I'll take care of it later."</p> <p>Just then, my phone rang, and I had to answer it. It was Mike. I'd known him from work a while; we had dated for a while, and had gotten married right after high school. Mike was married, too, and our first was a wonderful time as long as we both lived. At that point, we had been intimate as good friends for about as long as anyone in our lives could remember.</p> <p>After we hung up, I looked at her for a minute, and said, "That was your friend, Traci." I think the answer was obvious; she wanted to spend more time with me. She told me that she'd call to see if we could do lunch that night. That seemed okay, and we had the next few days to ourselves, which we had planned to do anyway (even though we had to be back in town on Wednesday)! At that time, I was very curious what had happened.</p> <p>The next morning, she didn't call. We both had to return to work immediately. On Monday, I called her and gave her the call she hoped for. We got down to business. We spent most of Monday and Tuesday talking and planning what we were going to do.</p> <p>I had set the plans, but she asked when. We decided not to rush things, so I told her then that she had the time to find out more about this place I'm headed to.</p> <p>By the time I got home that evening, she had gone through some new details that needed to be taken care of. And as she was finishing, I'd called, and asked her to come back when we were ready to move things along with our new relationship.</p> <p>When she got into the house, I said, "Are you okay, Traci?"</p> <p>"Yes, sir," she replied as she opened a can of Diet Coke from the fridge, and took a healthy toke. "It's nice to be around someone who appreciates me in a sexual way."</p> <p>"Oh, yeah. I like the way you're appreciating me. It's very sexy," I said as I took the can over to her. I noticed when she turned around to put it in front of me she was looking straight at me from behind and smiling, but otherwise she was focused and looking at me. I noticed she had opened one of the beer can handles that held it, and had held up the other one for me to pour.</p> <p>"Well, what do you think? Does it make me look good?" she inquired. "It does; but I can see why you like it!" she said with a warm smile. "And you know it's really you that likes to look at me."</p> <p>I was having a difficult time believing how sexy that statement was. "I'm glad you like it," I replied. As I passed, I saw that she was taking a double take. Her smile broadened considerably. "Wow! That's awesome."</p> <p>"You know that's what I liked about it," I replied. "That and the fact that you liked it a lot!" I added, and gave her a long kiss on the cheek.</p> <p>"Are you going to be my date tomorrow night?" she asked. "This one is going to be special. I think it's really going to be special, and I think the two of us are going to become great friends again."</p> <p>"Oh, yeah," I said, "If I can be your date."</p> <p>"Why do you think I want to do this, sir?" she asked with a sexy laugh. As she stood up, still carrying the beer can, she slid it toward me, and set it down on the kitchen counter. The front of her skirt had ridden up considerably, which gave me a good look at the dark patch of her crotch, the lips of which were already glistening in readiness.</p> <p>She was wearing a silky sheer skirt with a slit up the side, just above her crotch. As she moved to stand over me, she paused, and just as we had when she got off work, she looked over my body and said. "How about you?"</p> <p>"I'm game, ma'am," I replied with a grin. Then I turned to her and smiled as I sat down on the kitchen stool.
