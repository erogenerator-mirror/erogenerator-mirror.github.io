"The boys at the school said they would keep an eye on me. One got in trouble."</p> <p>"But, but it's not really me with you and I..."</p> <p>"And they're right," I finished her sentence. "Look, I really don't want to do this."</p> <p>I looked around her apartment. She had her front room set up in a half-bath with a full-sized tub. The TV was on but on mute. It's not like I'm looking to hear the world in the background and then she'll ask me to move out and stay and do stuff with her. What could be all of this for, after we had been friends forever? This wasn't like her or me at all.</p> <p>"Is everything okay?" she asked quietly.</p> <p>"Yes..."</p> <p>"Does it hurt?"</p> <p>"It still hurts; I guess...sort of."</p> <p>"Why's that?"</p> <p>"It's not like you or me and you could have found someone we can be with if we choose to be together. But I'll need a way to deal with it."</p> <p>"Well, no, not really. It's just that there isn't something else we can do for each other. I need you two to know that, right?"</p> <p>Her eyes were still glassed over. I could tell the look on their faces was genuine. "I promise," I insisted.</p> <p>"I know you did, and it really doesn't matter if you're with them," she said. "I don't really want to do this with you, but...please, tell me," she begged.</p> <p>So I took the opportunity and sat her on the sofa. I pulled her close to me and, when she opened her mouth, kissed her deeply. I loved the taste of strawberries, and when she tasted like wine, she was a natural. And, when she sucked on my tongue, I tasted a nice, fresh strawberry lip gloss. She was intoxicating to say the least. I ran a hand down her back and felt the curve of her lovely ass, squeezing it again a bit.</p> <p>"This is it," I mused. "This is what I am for you. I'm your best friend. It was your idea to have a good time with me. You're my best friend."</p> <p>"I...I love you," she blushed. "If it's all wrong, just tell me, but...please talk to me, okay?"</p> <p>"I really do mean it," I assured her. I pulled away and looked deeply into her shining blue blue eyes. "If you really love me, let's just talk about it."</p> <p>"I don't want to make you feel ashamed or ashamed," she told me softly. "It's just that I really love you, and I really need to talk to you if I...".</p> <p>I put my finger to her mouth, and said, "Shhh. Relax. I promise we won't talk about it."</p> <p>"I really...don't have anything to wear tonight," she assured me. "I didn't plan on wearing this. It's just that...I think you should."</p> <p>I smiled, kissed her softly, stepped back and said, "No, I really would love to come over, so you can wear it."</p> <p>She leaned up and kissed me again, pressing her body against mine, her arms around my neck. "And you should be ready, too, so you can go home."</p> <p>I stood up, and, looking her in the eyes, took her hand. I kissed her fingers as they slid down the side of her hand. They turned and I followed them down to her thighs, where I pulled her toward me so our bodies were pressed firmly against each other. Finally she was on her knees. I was holding her by the ass, pulling the fabric of her dress up to her waist and then letting it go. As I pulled it upward, we were naked except for our shoes. The fabric pulled so tightly against us and she leaned over to grab our ankles.</p> <p>My erection was a bit harder than mine, a real turn-on right now, but it was worth it, as she sucked my fingers as I wrapped my hands around her naked body and lifted her on to her tip toes. She was incredibly sexy. It was time to stop being like some other girls and start acting.</p> <p>I leaned back a bit and pulled her hands out of the way. I stood with my feet on either side of her and my hands wrapped around her waist. I began kissing her again, a slow, sensuous kiss, taking in every inch of her. I pushed my tongue between her lips and moved my hand up her thigh.
