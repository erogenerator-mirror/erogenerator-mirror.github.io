"Yes, yes..." "It's going to be wonderful." "Good luck with your son." "Do you mean a baby?" "I've got her, of course...you'll just have to pick and choose who it is." "She's not gonna be..." "You need to save that for another night...or two-o-day. Then we can have the night to ourselves."</p> <p>He smiled when he saw her eyes widen as he moved closer to her, "I'd love that...please?...no promises." "I have your word that this will only be worth two months from now. If you want to stop just say so...it's the easiest way to get over it."</p> <p>She thought she knew what he meant, but did she really want to?...the look in his eyes said it all. She pulled her skirt a bit lower...it was more up on it...her legs were bare now.</p> <p>"No," she said, "that would never stop right now." Her stomach rumbled when she continued with what was her response...she wanted him to feel right at home in her. She didn't realize it but that thought was just as much for him or to her as for him. She closed her eyes and leaned into him. He could hear the excitement in her tone. He turned his head to look at her.</p> <p>"It is going to be wonderful...I promise." "You say that word...it's more like it is me speaking." "You say that word a lot." "I can't help it..." It felt right...it had been a long time since someone had called her that...that was the key turning her on with an open invitation. She was thinking of the first time she had thought of it.</p> <p>He pulled back enough to look into her eyes and said, "I'm talking about you...this moment...this time."</p> <p>She reached up to him and pulled him down...she pulled up her own shirt higher. She could feel his eyes on her skin...his eyes locked on it.</p> <p>She knew where it was going...this was everything she'd ever wanted. She pulled up her shirt and kissed him...she could feel the warm of his body pressing against hers with his body.</p> <p>She could now feel his hand slowly travel down her body...the anticipation was driving her crazy as she pulled his shirt up and began unbuttoning his shirt...her hands reached to the hard nipples and began to tease them.</p> <p>"What are you doing?" He asked, leaning more up against her as he began to unbuckle his own pants. "I was just thinking about you." "Why?" "Well," she began to unbutton his pants, "I was thinking about everything." "I think I should ask...do you?" "I guess we should."</p> <p>"No..." but he was now pushing her to her knees and pulling her closer. He stepped out of the clothing and tossed it to the floor. She looked up. He had left his pants lying on the floor as he pulled his underwear down to his knees.</p> <p>"That's it...go ahead...fuck..." she breathed. He pushed her back until her face was pressed against his hard cock. She smiled as her mouth opened to him and he began to tease the tip with his tongue. She leaned up and opened her mouth wider...he put his hand on her face and guided her mouth onto his hard shaft.</p> <p>She heard her own moans as he began to fuck her mouth slowly, the only sounds being of her lips and tongue moving...fucking it, sucking it, stroking it.</p> <p>He had been hard at least three minutes before she let go.</p> <p>"I'm sorry...I couldn't help myself..." he said when she looked up at him. He was smiling at her...the expression on his face showed he liked it too. "Well...you're not sorry. It's just not you I've been wanting to..." She said as she leaned back a bit.</p> <p>"I know...do you...like this?" he asked as he pushed into her mouth once again. Her eyes opened...his face was right in front of where she was...she watched him intently, letting him know he could do whatever he wanted to her.</p> <p>"Do you...like sucking on me?" "Oh!...yes...yes..." she began to move her mouth up and down, her mouth opening wide.</p> <p>She felt the heat rush to her face as she made love to him.</p> <p>She felt like she had given him a blowâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
