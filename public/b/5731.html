"I'd love to suck on a pair of them again."</p> <p>"That's the kind of sucking I'd love to do after the workout. Or not do at all!"</p> <p>I rolled off of her, pulling her to me. We kissed like we hadn't been together in years. Her hand went down my chest. Her mouth met mine again and we both moaned softly in satisfaction. I slipped my fingers under both of her blouse sleeves and felt the softness of her shoulders under them. I began to push the blouse up over her shoulders and felt the cool air against my chest. It felt good against my nipples and I groaned when she nipped at them gently. I didn't want to do that, yet.</p> <p>"We have a lot to do," I said. "I can't think of much else right now."</p> <p>We looked at each other for a minute. I wondered if I should feel guilty or happy to have this chance. I realized that I loved her. It wasn't a question. She told me that. She said I should feel good too. For some reason it made me want to tell her I loved her like that. She also admitted that it had been a while since I felt like that. I didn't realize how much of a turn-on it was. But, it got the job done, didn't it?</p> <p>I started working on a button on her shirt. By the time I was done with that, she was pulling out of the room. I was pleased. It was too hard to resist now. I pulled my shirt off. She hadn't bothered with a bra. She was wearing one, the one that looked so sexy in the blouse. Just a loose cotton thong, not a top. Her nipples stood out against the blouse. They looked as hard as I had hoped, and the blouse was lacy and light-colored. I didn't stop there: the blouse buttoned just far enough to give her a peek at her bra.</p> <p>I pushed her back down into a pillow and we began a lazy 69 again. Her lips felt incredible on my cock. She was so soft. I could taste more of her than I could her pussy. She tasted like heaven on my tongue. She didn't seem to be at the limit in that department.</p> <p>I felt myself getting close. I wasn't just at the point of orgasm. It would take a long amount of coaxing to be ready to let go now. I pulled out of her and rolled to my other side. We lay on our sides, me with one leg thrown over hers, and she with her head on my shoulder. I wondered if my cock was still inside of her, if it hadn't. I wondered if the whole thing had become the work of a short-lived fantasy. I knew I wanted to keep her, but I also knew she wasn't about to quit. It was hard to tell in the light of the night.</p> <p>I took a deep breath. It was time to roll over. That was a hard one. I wanted to roll her gently on top of me and make love to her the way she'd made me feel last night. I wanted to feel as good as I have last night. I wanted to be one with her, even if it was a short time. But I also didn't want to think about the time we had spent together. I wanted to do this all weekend. I wanted to make love to her just as much as she wanted to make love to me.</p> <p>I rolled over and laid there beside her. Her hand slid under the covers and began to caress my cheek. I kissed away every emotion and sadness I might have felt about her. I wanted this night all to be wonderful, but most of all I wanted to make love to her.</p> <p>I slid up her body and kissed her again, enjoying that gentle caress of her lips. When I'd kissed her lips, I'd felt her breath on my teeth. I'd felt that softness of her body on mine. All my worries about the future were gone. I was finally making love to her. She was my woman, my woman.</p> <p>I slid off of her and turned onto my back. Our eyes met again. I saw the confusion and love there. She was the love and the care we needed for each other. She was the woman in every sense of the word. I reached down for a breast, feeling the softness of it as I caressed and stroked her nipples. I reached her navel and rubbed the belly of her beautiful pussy. We were naked and in each other's arms again, the first time I'd kissed and touched her there. We were in each other's arms. We were in the arms of the one.</p> <p>I pushed out a little, lifting her legs around my waist. I was looking at the pink slit of herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
