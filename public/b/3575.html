She lifted her head from her bed. The light was still on. She stepped to the window. It was her neighbor, Mrs. Wilson. She had come home early from work this morning, and had seen Bill Wilson out there on a bike riding away in his rented rental van. She walked to her window, her eyes never leaving him. He was walking toward her through the back yard. His shirt was undone. He had one arm across his chest, his other hand sliding through his hair. He had on sunglasses that looked like they were covering his eyes. He wasn't sweating. His skin was smooth except for the slight patch of grey between his arms. He was wearing t-shirt, and shorts. "Hi."</p> <p>She sat back, looking at her neighbor. "Nice day today."</p> <p>The older white woman turned from the window, giving Bill a wink. "What's wrong?" Bill asked.</p> <p>She moved out the back door to the porch. "Sorry, Mrs. Wilson. I was looking for someone. You got my neighbor out here?"</p> <p>She stepped closer to Bill. He leaned toward her, their faces only inches apart.</p> <p>"I just wanted to talk to you for a few minutes." Bill said.</p> <p>She nodded. "Sure. You guys can talk over here." She reached out her hand to let Bill place a hand on her shoulder, but he waved her away. "I'll come back."</p> <p>He stepped to the front door. "It's ok, ma'am." He said into her ear as he opened the door.</p> <p>'Oh, my God, this guy's going to walk right in front of me, wearing sunglasses, like that, and look like he's a kid in a candy shop. If he gets a boner he'll have a heart attack. His house is way below the front of our yards. I'll make him get behind the door. That's pretty fast."</p> <p>Mrs. Wilson walked back into the kitchen. "That's no good. Your neighbor over there is pretty hot." She pointed to the old neighbor, a little taller than Bill. "That guy over there has a thing for older women." Then she added with emphasis. "My neighbor says his is a 'hot little old lady.'" The voice from the other side of the door, Bill's neighbor, turned Bill face down on the table so that he had to raise his head to see who was coming in.</p> <p>She watched him, waiting expectantly. "I see you're not at home. Where have you been?"</p> <p>"It's been kind of a shock visiting in the week. I had the house to myself, and it's been just a couple of weeks."</p> <p>She smiled. "We could have gone more, but we're getting to that. Here, let me show you how my house is more than a duplex." She stood there, watching him. Bill reached up with both hands and pushed his hands under the table. She reached out her hand to hold him around the waist, but he pulled back.</p> <p>"I'd never leave a home so completely empty."</p> <p>"It's ok." He replied, his hands still in her grasp. "I'm sorry about your husband. I can get a job if he's ok with it."</p> <p>"That's ok." She replied. "I'm not afraid to take a chance. I didn't mean anything by it."</p> <p>Bill reached up under the table and hooked his fingers around her shorts. He slowly pulled them down, until the shorts were bunched around her ankles. He stared at her exposed pussy, her swollen pussy lips, her pink clit standing high at attention.</p> <p>"You're not going to hurt yourself?" Bill asked.</p> <p>She nodded. "Are you going to be ok with it?"</p> <p>He smiled. "I think so."</p> <p>She stood in front of him, as close as she could get in a few seconds. Her hands fumbled with his belt, zipper and shorts. Bill stepped out of his shorts. His dick was already hard and standing proud up above his lower body. "I guess you're not ready for sex all this time," he said coyly, "are you?"</p> <p>She reached her lips out to kiss him again. Their bodies touched and she felt his penis move against her thigh, as he lowered his mouth to hers. Her hands went straight to his shoulders. "God, you kiss so good..." She said, kissing his neck as she moved back a little. His hand came up to caress her breasts, and she moved her hips forward so that his hard penis rubbed right on her clit.</p> <p>"I don't like kissing and making love," she said, her lips not moving. "I like men to kiss andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
