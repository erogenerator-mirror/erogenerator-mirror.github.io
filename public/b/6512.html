I had wanted nothing more than to hold him for hours. We pulled into our driveway and I was almost relieved that our house had a nice, dark backyard as well. We got out of the car and I grabbed his bag, he got out of the car himself and we headed inside. As I was taking my coat off I heard voices on the other side of the door and I turned to see who was coming.</p> <p>I walked over, he was already undressing and I took off my coat and joined him on the bottom step, he was now nude and I could clearly see the outline of his member, the look on his face was lust. We kissed at the bottom of the stairway and the look on his face showed he was a bit nervous about how I was going to handle his evening. He looked at me and slowly started unbuttoning my blouse, he had a sexy look in his eyes and I found myself leaning against him as I let my blouse drop to the floor. He took off his shirt and I stood there watching his muscles tense up as he stripped off his clothes, I had only been with two men that I had been with but one of them had me stripped from the waist down and another had taken my cherry.</p> <p>We continued kissing and I slid my hands around his neck and slowly slid my tongue into his mouth for a bit, then my hands ran up his chest, I heard the doorbell ring and a moment later, he opened the door and invited me in with a smile. I slipped past him and entered the kitchen area where we were, he followed me in and closed the door softly behind me. He looked at me with a smile as he reached behind his head and grabbed the handle, as he moved past me, he quickly took off his clothes. I heard the familiar sound of his belt being unfastened and he walked around the kitchen as I stood by the cabinet, still naked.</p> <p>He took his belt off and brought it to my lower back and then took one of my wrists with it and put it into the cabinet, then he reached down and grabbed my other wrist and pulled my hand up between us, I began to struggle, he was strong and I found myself pushing back the other arm and he grabbed my waist for leverage when I began to realize what was going on. His hand slid under my skirt and he slipped two fingers deep inside me and pushed them in and out, in and out.</p> <p>My body betrayed me as I began to moan as I was being pulled over towards the counter where he was standing, he leaned over me and dropped his face to mine, his tongue flicked out and traced the curve of my lips as he pulled at my lips and forced them open with his tongue, in what was a short but deliberate move, he pushed his tongue in between my lip and pressed it back. When I let out a long moan, he slid down my body and knelt up in front of me.</p> <p>I tried to resist him as he slid one of his very large erect shaft's from the opening of his pants. I opened my legs and he pushed his shaft against my pussy lips and slowly pushed it in. As I began to open to him, he slid his hands up under me and began to finger me again, his eyes looked into mine as he did this and as a result there was no longer any fear of him. The sight of his hard cock pushing against my wetness was a heady mix of arousal and pain as he began to fuck me. He was thrusting slowly at first but as fast as he could and I was wet at his pace he began to speed up his thrusts, the look on my face told him I was enjoying it as he felt me tighten.</p> <p>I came again and again against him as he began to grow and knew he just knew he was seconds away from coming when I screamed through my own intense orgasm, my entire body was shaking as he continued to thrust deep inside of me.</p> <p>He leaned over me and gently kissed me, then he stood up and slowly pulled his now still hard cock out of me. I looked over at the clock, the next hour was about half past and I could see that a late-shift had already ended and he was gone. Still completely naked, I looked at the clock, we had been gone nearly 8 hours. I could see a couple of car's in front of my house, and a couple of parked cars away from me. I stood up from the bed, grabbed a few things and started walking towards the front door, one hand around the handle, the other on my waist as I walked.</p> <p>When I got to the door I was met by the light coming through the blinds, it looked like an apartment building and looked like somebody who lived there could have lived there for a longâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
