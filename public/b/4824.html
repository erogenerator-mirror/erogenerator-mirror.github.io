I nodded. "I hope you were safe, but not hurt, because my mother will kill me if my father finds out."</p> <p>I closed the door to his room, locking it behind me and sat down on the bed.</p> <p>"So where is this going exactly, the two of us now?" I asked as he started pulling his shirt off.</p> <p>"I guess I'd better tell you," he said as he undid first his pants, before dropping them to the floor at my feet.</p> <p>A grin broke across my face as he sat back on the bed. "Hurry the fuck up," he said as he pulled down his boxers, exposing his massive erection to me. At first I didn't realize he had a penis, until he told me what was in front of me. But soon I had an erection of my own.</p> <p>"Oh wow," I whispered as I looked into his eyes and saw a mixture of love and lust. His eyes were filled with a lust I'd never felt for anyone in my life. I could feel the blood rushing through my body as I watched his cock as he pulled it free from its sheath.</p> <p>"I'm so sorry," he said as he fell back on the bed, pulling me with him.</p> <p>"Don't be," I whispered as he sat up, spreading my legs with his knees. His lips met with mine and his cock went straight into my mouth as my lips enveloped it, kissing and licking and sucking.</p> <p>The feelings that started in my head were not even what seemed real. I had a boyfriend a few months earlier who did the things I was thinking about but couldn't find it through a porno. It was all new and amazing to me, and then later, I went through several more relationships until I met Steve. We were together for nearly a year before I was able to get him to do it, and he loved it.</p> <p>As of later we were living together, so we got along fairly well. We talked about what we would like to do; anything, really except sex. One time I asked him if we could do everything.</p> <p>"You mean you'll go back to being straight with me?" I asked as he rubbed my clit. "Don't say that," I said as I moved a finger up to cover his cock. "We can have as much fun as you want with each other."</p> <p>A little louder this time, he laughed. "You're kidding right? You're kidding right?"</p> <p>"I'm serious. I'm going to try and make you happy, if you don't mind waiting until you're married then." I moved to my bedroom, still playing with my clit, hoping he'd still be there.</p> <p>"Not at all," he said. "I'll always love you," he continued.</p> <p>What did he mean by be happy? I was surprised he couldn't possibly be more serious than that. And what does he mean about a few weeks down the road when he said he wanted to get married? That's right, right up my ass on a night.</p> <p>So I decided to try and get him to do the same thing about me. I slid backwards towards him, until we were eye to eye again. I took his cock into my mouth and slowly let him slide down my throat. Feeling him going down my throat with his hard on pushed me close to the edge.</p> <p>"God baby," he moaned and I opened my eyes. Looking into his eyes I saw lust. Seeing the wild look of lust in them I knew I was on the right path... but what about love? I had just met him!</p> <p>"What do you have to say?" I asked as he slipped off the bed and pulled me onto the bed.</p> <p>"You're still a virgin, you know, right?"</p> <p>"I know, that's why we're not here," I answered. He leaned on one elbow, looking down at me.</p> <p>It felt awkward to ask him this, but to be honest, it turned me on a few things. But the first couple of dates we had had not been a particularly adventurous, but we were finally a couple and there was no pressure. We really were free with each other, no questions asked. And I could see he was ready to break that barrier.</p> <p>I leaned up, pulling him onto the bed with me and we got on our sides, kissing deep and passionately. He moved down to my neck, his body brushing mine as he slid it over me, kissing every inch. His fingers slid down my arm as he brought his mouth down to mine. His tongue snaked out to meet mine and as his hand drifted over my cheekâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
