He asked. "What's wrong?"</p> <p>I knew I had to get rid of it as soon as possible. "I need to have sex with Jack as soon as he comes over," I said. "I just don't know how I can manage without him. I'm trying."</p> <p>"Me too, sweetie," he said. "We really should just do it together."</p> <p>"OK, but Jack, he doesn't care about the details," I said. "His wife's been cheating on him with another man. I could have never brought him up when I was his age. I do want to do it."</p> <p>With that, I turned away from Brian and bent my back to show him my pussy. My bare breasts swaying from side to side as I bent down.</p> <p>Brian took me in his arms and kissed me. He slowly slid his hands down my back as he knelt on the sofa. As his hands traveled further down I could feel his cock start to grow as it grew.</p> <p>Just as he reached the top he gently pulled off the top of my shorts so that I was completely naked. He stood up, pulling down his boxers. And we both looked at his cock, and how it reached his stomach. It had become even shorter and was about as straight as his body.</p> <p>"God I love your body," I whispered, as he gently lowered his boxers. "It's so beautiful," I said.</p> <p>I kneeled between his legs and slowly leaned forward until I had all of him in my mouth. Brian still looked at his penis. "God it's huge!" I said, licking his cock in its entirety. My tongue ran up his shaft as his eyes closed, and his hands ran through my hair.</p> <p>Brian stood up so that he was kneeling next to my head. "Suck it, honey," he said. "Suck that cock. Oh, yeah baby. That feels so damn good!"</p> <p>Brian grabbed my head with his hands, and began to fuck my mouth. I continued to lick his cock until he pulled out and turned me around. I knew what was next. And when I looked over my shoulder to see his cock, he grabbed me by the hips and thrust his cock between my lips and into my cunt.</p> <p>When Brian pushed his cock to the back of my mouth, so I could lick his balls while he continued to fuck my face, I began to suck him. I held his cock in both hands and played with his balls as he fucked my mouth. This wasn't so bad after all, was I thinking?</p> <p>Brian had stopped fucking me and was now just holding my head, and rubbing his cock back and forth against the back of my throat. His balls were also moving with his body, which was driving me wild. The sound of his cock sliding into my mouth was getting me more and more excited.</p> <p>The way it felt, I was loving sucking his cock in my mouth and loving the sounds that came out of my mouth as his cock drove in and out of my mouth. Brian was now pushing my head into the sofa and he was moaning as he fucked my face.</p> <p>"God, baby, you suck cock so good," he said, getting louder. "Oh yeah...oh yeah...oh fuck yeah, oh yeah!"</p> <p>He was on top of me now, and I could feel his balls slapping my ass as he fucked my mouth. I was lost in the feeling of him entering me again and again. "God, baby, don't stop!" Brian cried, as his cock swelled and his balls began to tighten.</p> <p>As his hot semen shot into my mouth, I felt his warm fluid enter my vagina and as it moved inside, I knew that he was filling the very right places of my vagina.</p> <p>We lay there for a long time after our orgasms. Brian kissed me on my forehead, as I felt his sperm slowly deflate inside of me. I looked down myself at his large, white dick still in my hands. I looked him. His cock was still hard, as he rolled off me. He went to the kitchen and started a pot of coffee he was putting on to get a bit of something to drink. I went and sat in the love seat, trying to be the perfect "good little girl," as he called it, while he got the ingredients out of the fridge and brought out plates.</p> <p>After Brian left the room, I went to the bathroom and took a hot shower. There he was sitting on the couch, eating a bowl of cereal. I sat with him, sipping my coffee when he reached up against the wall between the seats to cup his hand on top of mine.</p> <p>Brian said, "Oh, that felt nice, sweetie."
