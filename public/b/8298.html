With one hand, he slid his hand lower to my pussy and began rubbing my clit, bringing a small moan from within me. He then brought two fingers of his left hand up to me so that he can reach my ass. He started with my butt and pushed his thick finger inside, slowly working it in and out.</p> <p>I was so close, but I was just a toy and not a toy. We were both close to going over the edge again, so I told him to get off. He did, and I immediately came as hard as I did. "Not now. Go on" I told him, "You're not getting off, right? Go for it!"</p> <p>He just lay back and I turned around so that he could have a better view of my pussy. He began to suck my clit and fingered my asshole, making me cum again. I could feel myself ready to get another orgasm. I knew I wouldn't last much longer and I told him to slow down. He slowed down his work just a little and told me to turn around and sit on his cock so he could lick me out. I felt him push inside of me and began to massage myself. I moaned some more as he came inside of me, and then I heard you.</p> <p>He was gone, like I had not seen him. He came back to my side and began to suck on my breasts. He pulled me close and asked if that was good.</p> <p>"Yes! That's good!" I said.</p> <p>He then pushed me over and laid me back. I looked up at you and saw why, and knew we would get the rest of the night off. You came over to me, and began kissing me. I could feel myself getting very aroused as your breasts met my face, and soon I had a tongue inside of me, going in and out. We both began sucking and sucking on each other's tongue once again as your face and chest met mine.</p> <p>You began rubbing your pussy up and down on mine, your breasts brushing my face. I could feel my clit getting rock hard again and it was all we could do to not come to your aid.</p> <p>He was still fucking me as we sucked and kissed, and occasionally I could feel myself tightening up and getting ready for my own release. He was still a bit hesitant, but he was willing to push a little further, if he was allowed. Soon, I felt my second orgasm coming and I called out for you.</p> <p>"Fuck me, now, you wonderful man. I want you to make me come like I came so many times." I could hear your smile as your hand rubbed on my clit with each thrust he makes. You then went after my pussy again with your tongue. "Oh, God, yes!"</p> <p>You came up and got on your knees, your pussy inches from my face. I could tell why. I could taste myself there. You began to rub my clit, and then it hit. I felt my orgasm hit hard. You could tell that I was cumming with each wave.</p> <p>"You're close." you then asked.</p> <p>"Yes!". I said, knowing what you liked, I wanted to please you just a little bit.</p> <p>"Can you tell?" - I really wanted to hear you say that.</p> <p>"Yes!" - I almost said, but was too scared.</p> <p>"Okay" - I could not get it out. I was just ready to let him know that I was going to come, no matter which one of us did what.</p> <p>"That's it!" - I felt the wave pass through me, I felt it move around in my body, I felt you touch me, and then it began to stop. I knew what was coming, and so did you.</p> <p>He did not let up though and had come inside me before I could. It did not take long for me to be on the brink again, I felt my own coming.</p> <p>"Good job," he finally said, "So, when do you next leave?"</p> <p>"I have a meeting with my boss, and a long weekend, so it will take all of next weekend to get there."</p> <p>You kissed me and gave him a gentle kiss on the lips. "No, no. It will be the weekend before."</p> <p>I could see a smile of agreement on both of our facesâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
