She was just going to call out to him when they heard someone enter. He came in with his friend and quickly set a drink for her. The three of them went to sit near one another.</p> <p>"You can leave your clothes there," said Mike, "my roommate's going to join in after awhile. I think it'd be nice if she's too." His roommate was a younger version of Sam and her husband. She was about Sam's age but didn't really look too good. He knew he wouldn't sleep with her but she did look like a pretty woman. She looked to be about five-four when he heard her boyfriends voices as they entered the room. She was giggling and kissing him when he came into the room.</p> <p>She told him quickly that her boyfriend had caught her. He was already naked and had his hands full. As he lay down on the bed, he realized that there was no way she was going to do anything about this.</p> <p>Sam looked over at the other man and told him she wanted him. "Just fuck me", she told him.</p> <p>In the few seconds that she had been talking to him, she hadn't realized that he was hard. He had a massive cock and was as long as his friend's cock.</p> <p>"You said you wanted to save it for your friend."</p> <p>"Yeah, I thought she could use it."</p> <p>"Get over here and fuck me," she demanded.</p> <p>"But you've already had me all night."</p> <p>"So? I'm just a piece of meat for you," she said as she pushed him on the bed.</p> <p>She climbed on top of him and pushed her dripping hard cock into him. They both moaned as she slid all the way into him. She moved around the bed till everything at once filled up her. She rode him for about five minutes like that. Her boyfriends cock still wet with her juices. She felt so wet, so good. She could see the outline of their bodies as she looked at what was going on.</p> <p>"I want you to keep fucking me in other ways when I'm done. I don't want you in my mouth, but you can move around some and I'll be able to go again. Ok?"</p> <p>"Sure."</p> <p>"I love the thought of having your cock inside me. I know you can slide it in and out of me and I'll cum again and it'll be over quicker," she told him while she was moving her hips.</p> <p>She felt a finger probe her ass and slide into it. She was having a hard time concentrating. He was pushing his finger in and out of her tight ass. She couldn't help herself from moaning out as more cum filled the place that her boyfriend's cock was filling now. He had one finger in her pussy that was wet as well as his other hand. He pushed it into her ass as she fucked hard into him. The finger slipped out as she reached between her and her boyfriend's body and started caressing her asshole. She felt an intense wave of pleasure come over her as she came. He kept pushing his finger into her ass and she felt the pressure of both ends on one of her body. Suddenly, she felt something new. He slowly pulled his finger from her ass and he was on his back and she on top. She pulled off his clothes and climbed on to his cock.</p> <p>She felt him enter her. She felt like she was about to orgasm again but she didn't. It only happened once that night. She couldn't take any more. He didn't stop and she felt the pressure of two loads of cum filling her pussy. She felt him roll over and she laid her head by his chest. They were both completely satisfied.</p> <p>"Thanks for everything", she said as she kissed his chest, "You really do me a favor."</p> <p>"So, you liked fucking me, huh?" he asked, "You still think it would be too much to leave Sam?"</p> <p>"I know" she said as she cuddled up next to him and held his hand. He stroked her as she lay on the bed holding his hand. "Are you sure you're Ok with this? I know you've been worried about me cheating on you. I know it's ok. Maybe our relationship will be different."</p> <p>"That's the first time anybody's ever told me anything more than I already know," he saidâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
