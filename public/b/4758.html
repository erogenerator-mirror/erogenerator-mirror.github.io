Gretchen came over in her skirt and looked at me, giving me a quick, wide-eyed look, with a little smile.</p> <p>"Good game, Andy, I've been very bad!" she said as she picked up a small red box on the coffee table and took it back for me.</p> <p>I took it as told and took a deep breath. "I...I don't think we should."</p> <p>Gretchen pouted and batted her eyelashes at me, which she quickly averted. I shook my head and followed her in looking around the living room.</p> <p>"Now, let's see the couch!" I had the couch down when I heard the sound of heels descending on the floor to my right. Gretchen was looking at me with a mischievous grin. She took my hand and pulled me to the living room, holding it out for me to take, her eyes sparkling. "You better not run from me, Andy" she laughed</p> <p>"I will."</p> <p>She took my arm and led me to the couch, sitting me down and getting on her knees in front of me.</p> <p>"I love you, Andy," she said, her face serious, "I'm not going to put a foot wrong. When did you lose your cherry?"</p> <p>I laughed and threw my hands up again, "I remember...," I answered, "when we kissed?"</p> <p>She leaned closer in the couch, her eyes never leaving mine. "I remember everything," she said quietly. "It's about you, Andy. The kisses we made... It's about what it feels like to let you have what some of us think is 'that' all that time...I remember," she went on softly, "the first one, of course, and it was amazing...It was always you...and what you tasted like."</p> <p>"Did you want to see more?" I asked hopefully.</p> <p>"Well," she said, grinning softly, "but now I'm scared...I can't do it...You're my knight..."</p> <p>I laughed lightly and pulled her into a hug, pulling her hips down against mine, my cock immediately rising to meet her. She kissed me gently and gently, letting my kiss lead back over where we both wanted to go, holding my hands for a second and then starting again.</p> <p>"Is that better?" I asked with some hesitance, "Are you having any trouble?" I asked, smiling to let my voice rasp, "I love how you kiss...I feel so much stronger than myself," I said with a smile, "I could do without the stress of going out of town, and being naked all the time, it feels great," I finished.</p> <p>She grinned at me and then reached over and took my hands firmly in hers. "It's good to have you back," she said, as she kissed me again.</p> <p>I held her in my arms as her arms dropped over mine and she leaned forward, her face near mine. "I love you, too," she said, her lips just a fraction away from my face.</p> <p>"I'll never look at you the same again," I said quietly.</p> <p>Gretchen just looked at me in shock, her smile dying off. "Andy," she began slowly, "I can't say I've been the best kisser in my world in a long, long time...But it was..." she trailed off and looked at my eyes, searching them, "I think I could...do that to you all the time...Just wait and see...You'll think I'm a good kisser."</p> <p>I reached up and stroked one of her breasts gently, "Gretchen," I said, making her let her head drop back and close her eyes, "I love you..."</p> <p>Her eyes flew open and she looked down at me, her smile fading from her face. "I love you, too," she said quietly. "I can't put a kiss on you, but...God, I love you," she said then, "I...," she said with a quiver of her lips, "I'm not saying I can just go back to where we were before." She smiled brightly.</p> <p>I turned to look at her and saw that she looked a little scared, but happy. "Gretchen...you've said...I just...I..." I stopped as I saw the look in her eyes that told me I couldn't say anything and that meantâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
