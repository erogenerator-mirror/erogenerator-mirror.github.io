"It's all pretty innocent."</p> <p>Gia had to let her down a bit, but the feeling of sympathy when she saw us getting into Karen's car made her feel happy. We made it up to Karen and we all got into the car, and then it was time to head inside.</p> <p>"Can I bring you the meal first," Karen asked?</p> <p>"Sure, the first piece is excellent," Gia replied. "How about a nice long salad?"</p> <p>We followed Karen to her apartment door, and I knocked on the door.</p> <p>In a moment, a pretty young girl came from behind to open and shut her front door.</p> <p>"Who is that, Karen? I thought she was out with her boyfriend."</p> <p>"Oh, Gia, come on, let her in," Karen replied. "She said she has a surprise for us that I won't tell her about."</p> <p>"What's going on, Gia?"</p> <p>"Can you meet my dad, he's at school," Gia replied. Then Gia walked across the room.</p> <p>"Hi, um, Karen," came Karen's greeting in response to Gia's arrival.</p> <p>"Hi, Gia. Nice to see you again."</p> <p>Gia's heart skipped a beat, and she flushed a pinky-faced. "Okay, come on inside," Karen said.</p> <p>When Karen led me to the kitchen, we were all very familiar with the layout of the place, and we all enjoyed walking in and out without being noticed or noticed of course. And Gia had the impression that, for once, we actually went into the kitchen without being noticed at all.</p> <p>I could tell that the two women were trying to remain neutral, but as we walked around the kitchen and dining room, I started to wonder if there was any one else there who would be watching us without wanting to be noticed either.</p> <p>Then we all sat down with our food, and I felt suddenly a bit silly at the thoughts of how I had just put on my best smile and not been noticed. Fortunately, Karen had seen me looking, and she gave me a smile that went from ear to ear just like I had done for the past minute.</p> <p>Gia sat down across from Gia. "So," I asked her? The truth was that our lives changed considerably in the last couple of weeks. I still had no idea how we would handle this.</p> <p>"Karen tells me that the surprise she gave you was all for us."</p> <p>I laughed. "Not quite enough to give me an excuse, but it was more than you can imagine. She also said that it would be really hot for you to see me naked," I said.</p> <p>Karen and Gia laughed, and then Gia said, "Well, I guess that makes a lot of sense to you, but, well, it also means that I might just have to come out there and get out my underwear if you want me to get out my bra sometime."</p> <p>"I don't think it's fair!" I replied.</p> <p>"Well, not if you're asking me to lose my virginity," Gia retorted. Then she added, "Or if you're going to show it me."</p> <p>That seemed to throw Gia's mood.</p> <p>"Okay," she said, "You're off to the rescue." And then, "But I'm wondering how to get your underwear off."</p> <p>Gia was now feeling really excited about being naked on a real first date. She was starting to get wet as we all sat around with their food as well. We were all silent, but the room started to fill up. Then Karen turned to Gia.</p> <p>"I'm going to go and stand in the door, and give you the right signal to get down on all fours."</p> <p>Gia did that. As Karen walked across the living room floor with some papers, Gia felt more and more excited. When she got to the door Karen grabbed a handful of paper and told me to get the clothes off. She was going to turn around and get dressed in front of Gia, but instead, she had me kneel down on the floor. While I thought about the implications of the situation I realized that it was one of the things that had me even more excited than it had been.</p> <p>Then Gia heard me kneel again and felt her boyfriend doing the same to her. With that, she turned over as if she had to be seen.</p> <p>I knelt there with my mouth right in front of Karen's pussy, and she had to grab hold of my head to keep me from sliding her panties off. Karen was moaningâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
