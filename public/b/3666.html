I sat on the toilet as I ran the shower. I didn't wash off my body and thought of the years that I'd been with men - but I never thought of myself as a "normal" woman.</p> <p>The shower was very erotic although I wanted more. I finished quickly and stepped out to dry myself off. On the bed in the bedroom were two pairs of jeans. The second pair was a blouse and black shoes. The first pair was my thong panties held up with a clip. The blouse was a tight fit with very tight round breasts which swelled out almost as if they needed a bra. The skirt was thin and quite short in half but it was quite sexy. It barely covered my arse so I left it open so that when I bent over you could see my pussy lips through the thin material. It was a nice fit and I smiled at it as I walked back to the bed. I sat down again and picked up my new jeans and shoes. I put them on once more and then wandered to the lounge at the end of the bed.</p> <p>I took a drink of water, which I knew would be needed after sitting there for a while. I picked up the DVD again and turned it on. It was a film I'd rented a few weeks earlier to a group of people, mainly women, who had been invited to go to a film festival. It was entitled "The New Start to Slutdom." I had put the "B" in, but when I turned the screen on I noted the "C" had been written on the screen not over the title page, but on the other side of the screen, but underneath that was a different "C" character with a "D" in the middle, and it was also titled "The new start in the Whore" at the bottom of the title. If the names were different, it could have been a theme from the film or from one of the film directors, but the title gave the "c" character, and I wasn't sure.</p> <p>I turned the TV on and set the remote control in the left hand corner. As it ran I turned on the DVD and started watching again. I turned it on again and it was very sexy of a film and I started to watch it too. While watching the film I was sitting on the edge of the bed in the spare room of the flat. I was still wearing a bathrobe but had put on an overcoat. As soon as I closed the door behind me I could feel the warmth of the room on my skin and I felt sexy as I stared at the film on the television in the flat.</p> <p>I'm not sure how long I watched, but it was very exciting. I was getting more excited and I think the fact that the clothes I was wearing were still the underwear I had worn when I'd fucked Roger was affecting me as more and more of my body was exposed. My nipples were hard and pointing, and the thin fabric of my blouse was quite sheer to expose my navel. The soft material of my blouse was almost transparent - I don't usually wear a bra because it makes me feel like my breasts are fully exposed. They were certainly not as full as they seemed from earlier but I could feel them pressing against the material of my blouse.</p> <p>This time I was sure I could hear the sound of my own wet pussy and I knew I could see that the colour of my lipstick gave those dark hairs on my legs a shine. I was aching for it. I had to have it. I put my hand inside the thin material of my panties and stroked my clit.</p> <p>I could feel it hardening under my fingers but was not going to ask how they felt; it was too embarrassing and there was no way I could do anything about it before they were due back on me. I could hear the sounds of the TV, but didn't stop stroking myself. I wanted what I thought there were no going back and I wanted to go for myself right in a theatre.</p> <p>I could feel the tingling start to set in my body and it was starting to feel good. I was getting a bit daring but I'd lost control when the film was on. I'd taken off my thong and now was stroking my pussy furiously. It was the first time having someone watch a porn that I hadn't had a real man in my life, but it was arousing and I was getting excited. I knew that with this much experience it wouldn't take me too long to reach an orgasm again.</p> <p>I let the tension out. "This may be exciting, but it's my first experience." There had been a certain amount of risk that way, but the risks seemed to justify it. I could feel the warmth of my body begin to buildâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
