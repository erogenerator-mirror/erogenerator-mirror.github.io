I just knew it was wrong and hoped it would stop when it did.</p> <p>The other ladies left the store and left us alone together. We tried to do as much or as little as they could but still we kept getting looks from men. I was relieved, I thought it was a matter of time before they got a chance to see my body and, if they did, they would start treating me like a slut as soon was the time.</p> <p>We had been walking for nearly forty five minutes when we got stopped in a secluded spot. That gave me a brief flash on my phone saying that I had reached a new number. I was sure the one they had to offer was still in the area but it didn't seem that important to me at the moment. "How is it that you have now had the nerve to pick the exact place so soon? Do you think they will want to do more than check it every ten minutes?" "Are you kidding? They are always checking the places just in case and they never come back for more."</p> <p>"Well, I am getting a little worried because I do not think I will be able to leave my car all alone today because of my anxiety about getting caught. I am not sure how it will feel to walk down the street, let alone in the middle of the night. If you walk out with me I think I am going to be late because I really want to come back here tonight to enjoy your company."</p> <p>"I don't think you would do it if I weren't driving. I really think you would give yourself a chance to be with someone as attractive as I am."</p> <p>I could not believe that I was saying that and actually felt better. I was relieved that I had the nerve to do it but I was also a little worried about the fact that my car was being pulled on at this point. "There really is nothing to be concerned about. When you pull your car off of the street I would be glad to drive you home and let you get in a shower. If your hand were free what would you be doing?"</p> <p>"Are you sure about this? You could have me naked and all over your lap and not think twice about it."</p> <p>"No, I want that so badly that I would love to see if you were actually naked too."</p> <p>I was shocked and turned it to look to see my driver's license with my name, age and city of birth. They just gave me this fake ID. I handed it back hoping that I would never actually see the driver's license. When I did finally get in the car I made sure that I did not walk too fast. I wanted to be a good girl but I also liked to be so obedient. I also wanted to be able to control myself and not scare them off.</p> <p>I did wonder if they had left me to my own devices but didn't care if they went to the trouble of finding a way to do it. They were going to be very busy tonight and it would be good to work the situation before they got my car pulled on. It made me smile with anticipation and I did not even hesitate before jumping into the back seat and starting the car.</p> <p>As I was driving I had to let a few questions come as well. Did they know I was going out of town and was that why they were leaving me topless? Was I going to have to wait for hours to see if you noticed how many cars I was driving or was this just a phase I had to start living again? I didn't care right now and I guess my mind was just working with me and maybe it wasn't.</p> <p>Once I started the car and got into my driver's seat I could see that they were going to be long since gone. I looked at the road and then into the mirror. There was no traffic on my right side so what did they have to be worried about? I could drive on for a while to get there and not have to worry about how many cars there were in the area. I did notice that their car had two or three cars on the far end. I wondered if they were going anywhere but I couldn't think of any other options.</p> <p>When I got to their house there was already a note from the woman that said, "Call out if you want us to come by for anything."</p> <p>I looked back at the road and was thankful that they still were on it. When I reached over to the glove compartment I was rewarded by the sight of two hand cuffs, three or four chains and two leather straps. I didn't even notice them until they both came up over my hands to my wrists and then the chains tightened them. I had never been restrained before but I knew it wasn't going to change with the evening if either of them everâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
