She kissed him and added, "I didn't tell you what was on the agenda?"</p> <p>"Let me talk about it," he replied, "And we're going to do this again, and again."</p> <p>"Maybe later." Lacey replied. "Oh, and by the way, I forgot to tell you that we're going to be going to the party tonight. I'll bring everything in and bring the wine."</p> <p>"Wow," Tony said. He really wished he could come. He was ready to go. Lacey made him promise he'd come too. It was going to be a really hot experience, with lots of booze, and lots of sex, too, of course. They were ready.</p> <p>Tony rang up the check and paid it off, along with the check for later. He asked Lacey where to pick up the room key, and the room key, and he knew that if the hotel had a nice restaurant they'd have a nice dinner there too. Lacey had an old Ford Escape, just three-bedroom with a king-size bed, and some decent furniture, but this was the one for her.</p> <p>The drive to the party happened to take about four hours. It was an excellent party. The guys, mostly older guys, went out of their way to pick up all the food, wine, hors d'Oeuvres, and party favors, and all the drinks and food they could find. They also provided a wonderful buffet. Lacey was pleasantly surprised when Tony was there. He had on a blue blazer, and jeans. In a loose short dress.</p> <p>It was a great evening. The food was great. The wine was good. The music was wonderful. Lacey had a great time. She couldn't have been more excited. They had a great time.</p> <p>Just before eleven on the second half of Tuesday night, after dinner they went back to the party. Linda went to Tony's room. She saw him on the bed and she went to him. He looked at her and kissed her deeply, passionately. They kissed for several minutes, tongues intertwined. Lacey had never been kissed like that. It felt so good, and exciting as it went on. He finally pushed her on the bed, moved aside her dress to see her breasts and pussy, both gorgeous. He moved in between her legs, which had been wide open. He was amazed at how pretty her cunt was. He was in no hurry, but he was certainly going to enjoy every minute of it. He looked at her face with passion in his eyes as he moved into position to enter her. His cock, still in its flannel slacks, was very long and so hard. Lacey held his hips, guiding him into her. "Oh God, baby, that's nice, keep going, I'm about to come."</p> <p>He was not surprised. He'd imagined it. He had always been amazed at the power he felt when he was fucking a woman. He had to admit, it was pretty damn sexy. But, he knew he couldn't bring it up again. He pulled out of her, stood up, pulled off his shirt, and sat on the edge of the bed to take off his socks. And he realized too late he had a boner. He stood and undid his slacks as he watched his wife being fucked by a man she had just met a couple of hours earlier. She looked so sexy like that, all of a voluptuous young man's cock. He knew he would fuck her a dozen or more times that evening.</p> <p>Then, he began to think about what she had just done, which was almost as exciting as the fucking he and he had done. "Oh God, she looked so sexy. I'm about to come," Tony announced, "I'm ready for it." He quickly began to feel his balls tighten and he began to pump his jizz into her, grunting as he did. Once, he was sure about how much he had come, he pulled out of his wife, his pants to drop onto the floor, and pulled up his slacks.</p> <p>Linda was standing on the side of the bed, looking at him from her husband's legs. He'd forgotten what she was wearing when they arrived, and she had worn it when they got home from the restaurant. She was going commando today.</p> <p>Tony had made a mental note to buy a couple of sex toys, some for men not wearing underwear, some like rubber, some like butt plugs, some like butt plugs.</p> <p>But, for now, he went to his closet to pull it out. Some of it was dirty, and he was sorry after he got it out.</p> <p>It was a very attractive garment, a beautiful white silk negligee, with a lace garterâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
