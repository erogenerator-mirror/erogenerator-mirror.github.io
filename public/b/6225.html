I thought to myself, knowing that most men would be repulsed by his sexuality, and most people wouldn't be homophobic about gay men being attracted to them.</p> <p>"I don't think so," I replied. "As I said, the law doesn't apply here. And the police often arrest young gay people and take their money. I'm guessing that most people don't even know they want to do anything with girls either."</p> <p>"Do people know that gay people aren't supposed to do anything with each other on the streets?" my dad had asked.</p> <p>"No. The police say they only say 'no' if they find out what we're doing in public, though," I had replied, with a smile.</p> <p></p> <p>"I'm not sure that it makes any difference. I still have the hots for you, and you just won't let me be with you," my father said as he came around the corner.</p> <p>"I don't want any trouble. If my dad doesn't like it, he's coming to my rescue," I replied, not wanting to seem like a pervert, and therefore to sound less desperate.</p> <p>"I can't stop him, David," my dad said, as he came back to me.</p> <p>A big smile broke across my face. "Dad, you're not going to stop him! Don't be a stupid child, David, I know you haven't," I replied, feeling relieved, and also excited.</p> <p>"He's not going to stop me," my dad added, still smiling.</p> <p>"Don't worry, David. You'll see him and he'll go for it. You are doing it on your terms."</p> <p>"I can't!" I protested, "I don't have a clue of what to do except stop. If I get caught, Dad, I'll have to make do with the safe little place, which will be where we keep the cash to meet the girls. And you'll be in my father's sights," I said, trying to sound like a child again.</p> <p>"No, David," my father said. "If you're caught, I'll take you back home to your mother, where we can forget all the trouble."</p> <p>"If you take me back home, Dad, I'll keep the two of you together, won't I?" I repeated, my mind in a million miles. I was desperate.</p> <p>"I'll tell my brother that you're gay, David," he said.</p> <p>"He's not gay, Dad!" I told him.</p> <p>I walked back to my parents.</p> <p></p> <p>"Come on. We've been watching the girls," my father said, as the other two boys came up behind us. "I'll come out and get her from my car."</p> <p>"I can't," I protested. "I'll tell her dad."</p> <p>I stood there, looking at my parents in a daze, trying to find the words. My dad came out and the three of us went back into the house. I quickly dressed for the day. I picked up my jacket from my father's jacket pocket, as my mom and Sarah came out of the room.</p> <p>"Good job, you two," my dad told them, and we walked up to our houseâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
