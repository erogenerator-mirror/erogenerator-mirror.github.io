She looked so hot; her short skirt barely covering her legs and her tiny tank top struggling to contain her ample breasts. She had one finger tucked into the waistband of her panties playing with her pussy. She was already wet, her pussy lips slightly parted, showing off that glistening pink labia that had me instantly horny as hell.</p> <p>When we got into the bedroom, I was more than willing to give her the room number of her room. She didn't resist, not really. She just asked me to come over, which I did, making it easier on me that it would be harder on her if I left her alone. I had no doubts as she pushed me onto the bed, straddling me and kissing me while she kissed me some more.</p> <p>I knew that this was turning her on by the way she looked at me, the way her hand brushed up my inner thigh while she kissed me. Her fingers gently stroked and caressed the fabric that had gotten all sticky with excitement and that had me breathing hard.</p> <p>She broke off after a minute or so, "Come on, honey. You've got to find a way to use that tongue on me when I'm like that." She giggled a little and then pulled away, leaving us just looking at each other. "That won't do, I can't go that far."</p> <p>"What, why? We're just making out."</p> <p>"Well, your sister and I have just gone through a rough patch in the last couple of weeks and we need to go to a different school, but for the moment, I'm going to try and do something special, to see if what I'm doing turns you on. I've got a ton of fantasies, but I'm not sure what you were going to do to me." She sat back up so that her breasts were now almost on top of my head and then leaned forward and licked across my lips, her eyes on mine.</p> <p>"I'm sure I could show you something," I said, "maybe in the car."</p> <p>"I've got some lube in the bathroom." She laughed and we both went in there to get it.</p> <p>We cleaned up and I went back into the bathroom to use it, while she sat up on the edge of the bed and looked at herself in the mirror. She took another deep breath, pulled the tank top up a bit, and then put on a pair of skin tight black spandex shorts. It was the first time I'd ever seen her bare back before and was pretty new.</p> <p>"What the fuck you think you're doin'?" I was trying to hold back the smile. "What the hell do you think you're doing? I'll fuck you if I have to, but that's not what I came in here for." I didn't want to get to know this girl, but I was having trouble getting past my own embarrassment.</p> <p>"I...um...what's that mean?"</p> <p>"I'm just teasing, honey. What do you think you were doing?"</p> <p>She started to speak, so I put my finger to her lips.</p> <p>"Shh, you can tell me."</p> <p>"No, not really. What was I thinking? I was thinking that I was going to give this girl a lap dance and....."</p> <p>"Are you going to let me go now, so that I can have your cock?" She asked, "Or, at least let me make you cum? Or, maybe just play with your balls for you?" Suddenly her eyes went wide and she grabbed at my jeans, tearing them off, leaving me in nothing but my boxers and an undershirt.</p> <p>I saw this as an opportunity and I reached out and grabbed her hips, bringing her closer to me and placing my hands around her waist. I pulled her in closer to me and took that opportunity to put my arms around her back, pulling her closer to me. We kissed and I let the hands roam over her body. I got my hands under her tank top and felt her bare tits against my chest; I could feel how hard she was getting, pushing her shirt out away from her and how small her nipples were. I felt them with my hands, squeezing them and rolling them between my fingers. It was a wonderful feeling.</p> <p>I kissed her back, working her lips open with my tongue until she opened her mouth and started kissing me back. Our tongues mingled and danced together as she moaned some more. She pulled her top off and my hands went to her breasts. She stopped me momentarily to pull her tank top off and as I did her hands went up to my shirt and grabbed my waistband of my boxers.</p> <p>She pulled my boxers down and my rock hard cockâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
