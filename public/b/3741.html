I will call you my "little-girl". Just not fuck you.</p> <p>"Please?" she pleaded.</p> <p>"All right, I am serious." I smiled. "We will discuss it further when the time is right." I paused and took the gag out of her mouth. I slipped it back on and then knelt in front of her and pushed her forward into the chair until she was almost horizontal. I pulled the gag out of her mouth and looked at her as I slipped the blindfold back over her eyes. She felt like a helpless child, and when she looked into my eyes she felt weak and vulnerable. I lifted her chin to take the kiss and she kissed me back.</p> <p>The kiss continued as our eyes met. I looked at her for several seconds, her eyes were heavy and she looked as though in pain as she whispered, "Yes."</p> <p>"I will," I said. "If you choose to do that you will know that my love will be stronger every day. Now get your ass back to work. I need to go to class, as I've done too many of the last few weeks. You can take my car, I'll walk you to your car after work. Just remember that you are mine now." I left her standing on the side of the bed with tears streaming down her cheeks, she looked as though she was in hell.</p> <p>I helped her back to the shower, which felt great after the hours we had been at the office. I had to leave her on the bed crying and I had to wait for her to stop before she could shower. When she got to her door she found me waiting for her. "What is this? Didn't you tell me that I needed to get a room?" she cried.</p> <p>"No. I had something else else I need to tell you." I said. "I had planned to tell you when this would happen. But now it has." I added as she looked in my eyes. "We still have a day together as it is." I kissed her on the lips. "Now go clean up the mess you made, get all that cum you spilled out of your pussy and clean all the mess off the chair of you. I know you are going to put on makeup but this is important for you. We have to plan this out so you will trust me." I turned her and hugged her against me.</p> <p>"Yes," I said. "I forgive you. I am glad you came to the party. I love you. I know this means that we will not be together all together again. I love you too." I hugged her until tears slid down her cheeksâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
