He was glad not to need to use her nickname, rather than her proper title if she'd become uncomfortable.</p> <p>"You don't have to call me that anymore," she replied, almost shyly. "I like it," she smiled.</p> <p>"Well, you can call me that if you'd like," he chuckled.</p> <p>She leaned back and rubbed her pussy up and down again.</p> <p>"Can I get some lube?" she asked. She always brought the lube with her in case of need.</p> <p>"Please," he replied. He wasn't exactly sure about what kind of stuff she would be using. But from what he knew, it would probably be a lot of fun.</p> <p>"Well," she laughed, a smile stretching her lips. "I'm ready, if you are."</p> <p>He handed her a couple of bottles of the lube. She placed one hand on the arm of the couch and the other on his thigh. Her legs opened slowly as she bent forward. Her pussy seemed to accept it just fine.</p> <p>Slowly, she worked her body until her pussy was ready, then she pushed back. The feeling was wonderful. The feelings combined. And in her world, they were much more then just sex. They were love making. And if everything was real, then what the doctor would find out was the opposite. There was a real level of intimacy about their situation. And she felt like she wanted to make another relationship. She stopped and looked back at her body. It wasn't hard to tell just from the way her boobs bounced. Her whole body was glistening and moving slowly. She felt a little twinge of excitement and desire at the thought of having another man inside her. It made her want to have a guy to play with as well as have. She couldn't even imagine what other guys would see. She hadn't done that with any men in a long time. She couldn't even imagine. She shook her head slowly to dispel those thoughts.</p> <p>A deep, dark smile crossed her face to herself.</p> <p>"Now, are you ready?" she asked.</p> <p>"Sure," he said. "Let me lay down on the couch."</p> <p>With that, she quickly turned over to place herself on her front on him. Her head went down and her cheeks went up.</p> <p>"How do you think you'll look without your clothes on?" he asked.</p> <p>"How many times would I rather you were going back inside now?" she grinned.</p> <p>"How many times does this start?" he asked, lifting his hands to the side and pulling his shirt off. She helped him on with his jeans.</p> <p>And a minute later, he had his pants off. He had already kicked off his shoes. As a matter of fact, just about the one thing she hadn't done before was get herself naked now. He'd already seen her naked body as much as he'd seen her topless. He'd seen her naked and masturbated with her. He'd enjoyed that. He'd enjoyed it like last time as many times as she'd just made him. And if he'd been able to be with someone, he would have been able to enjoy it this time as well.</p> <p>She couldn't help herself. She knew her body was ready for him. She moved her hand over to her thighs. She spread her legs and leaned back.</p> <p>"Now, are you ready?" she whispered.</p> <p>"Yes," he answered, as he ran his hand up and down her thigh as he sat forward.</p> <p>She felt herself trembling as she thought she'd imagined being this way earlier. Now she was ready.</p> <p>"I'm ready," she whispered again.</p> <p>He leaned forward, his hand moving up her leg. And she shuddered. She really wanted to feel that cock inside her. Her vagina was so stretched out now, she could have stretched out an entire wall. But no! Not before he was ready. She was ready. But she was nervous. The thought of having to put her legs around him now was terrifying.</p> <p>"Just lay down with me," he said, taking off his shirt. She immediately laid on the couch. He was on her side and she straddled and sat on his lap, her stomach on his crotch, his hard cock just resting on the top of her pussy. She lowered herself onto his dick, slowly. She moved her lips down the front of his chest. Her hands went down and grabbed his ass by the hips. But just as she expected, he didn't push her away. He moved his hips upward and back. She felt him slide inside her. His dick was so hard now that it felt as if it was trying to push the breathâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
