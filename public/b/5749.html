I watched her ass sway in a couple of pinches. She was not far away, in my arms.</p> <p>"That was so sexy," I told her.</p> <p>She was right there, in my arms.</p> <p>We kissed before we headed to the bedroom.</p> <p>"I'm going to get into the shower, let's take a quick one," she told me.</p> <p>I turned back to her, and she kissed me again.</p> <p>"Let's take a quick shower and maybe you can make me happy tonight," and then she kissed me again...</p> <p>The next day, the house was ready to go. My mom and dad were off to play a game on the computer, while I was busy fixing dinner. When she came down, she looked different, not as hot as she had been in before.</p> <p>"Hey, mom," I asked her. "Your dad is going for a walk in the garden after work."</p> <p>It was just her, and I was wondering if she was still going to wear it, too.</p> <p>"Hi, my dad...oh, is it still here?" she asked and then kissed me...</p> <p>I got a hardon, because of her scent...</p> <p>"Mom...where is that perfume my mom said about last night? Should we wear it more?"</p> <p>"I don't know...you know, it reminds me of someone, even though I know you don't have much of a memory. I guess you don't need much reminding..."</p> <p>"I guess not. You smell good, too," she said as she got more and more in me.</p> <p>Mom and Dad started to get into the pool when there was a knock at the door.</p> <p>"Room service, would you care to eat? I heard you cooking dinner."</p> <p>"No...sure...but you want a steak and baked potatoes, not a whole lot of green beans."</p> <p>"Sure. I'll call when I'm done. I want to get a bite of dinner first."</p> <p>The door opened...</p> <p>"You're back in your panties!" I saw a face, too...</p> <p>"What?" she was shocked.</p> <p>"Your panties. You look hot, mom!" I said</p> <p>She smiled at me...</p> <p>"Just a second," and she came with us...</p> <p>When she was in the kitchen naked, I heard...</p> <p>"Oh no, wait, wait, that's not right."</p> <p>"It was sooo cool" she was giggling...</p> <p>"No, of course it wasn't. You're naked!" I laughed...</p> <p>"Sorry, it was just...well, it's so...I have my own secrets...sorry."</p> <p>"I know, I had no idea..." I turned to her, and I was still naked...</p> <p>"We don't have to be naked. We can be naked, too," she giggled.</p> <p>I was standing with my hands on my hips, looking at this beautiful nude girl.</p> <p>"You don't have to worry about anything."</p> <p>"Yes...I do...but it's you? Oh...you're sooo hot..."</p> <p>"I know you don't want to see my panties...I just can't help myself..."</p> <p>"Mom, please..."</p> <p>"Let's get out of here, before you get hurt...okay? Now you want to..."</p> <p>"Sure Mom...if you can just get to my pussy."</p> <p>I helped her get out of her clothes, and then she did too...</p> <p>"Let's make this a quick, big, and easy one," I said and stood there smiling at her.</p> <p>We went into the bathroom, and she sat down, in the toilet. While the shower was going, she told me...</p> <p>"Remember what you are looking at, just do what feels good for you. I don't know if I know how to tell...you know the feeling. I'm gonna do something special for you, so don't look at me like I'm just another girl from another store. I'm just you mom, I'll be a good one. Just go with what goes on and what moves you like and..."</p> <p>She was soaping up her breasts, as if nothing else was going on.</p> <p>"Are you sure this will be sooo...good?" she said in a soft sexy voice.</p> <p>"Yeah...I think you can tell. I can't tell if you're still wet, or if you are still sooo...oo excited from what you just did at my house?" I could tell she was still really excited by the way she looked, even though she had just sat down. She was sooo wetâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
