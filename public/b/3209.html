We weren’t about to discuss the events of the previous evening, but as we sat down, I noticed that, with her, she and I were not talking. She was whispering to me. I wondered if she was whispering, though. I thought back to last night and my hand rested on her shoulder. Our eyes met. Her eyes were darkly penetrating and a smile on her lips. I leaned in and met her lips for the first time. And, not a kiss of the old-fashioned way--nothing like the one we shared yesterday and certainly not a kiss of the new century--but a kiss of passion, of wanton joy! The kiss was a beautiful one, and my hand stayed with her. Her fingers were pressing against mine in a slow caress.</p> <p>We got up, and she walked me to the door with a warm smile that gave me the answer to say goodbye. She seemed to know immediately which way to go. As we kissed, our hands were exploring in all the right places. I was still uncertain how to proceed with this new relationship. After we got out of the car, she took me inside, saying, “You can walk by the lake tomorrow--it’s the best kind of lake there!”</p> <p>That night, we laid in each other’s arms, kissing gently. After some moments, she whispered, “Would you like to move into my place today? I’ve been thinking some things and it’s my first time, and I don’t know what to do....”</p> <p>She knew, too, that I was hesitant. I thought, I really did, but that we could just have a chance to go for it, to be open to what we wanted. I had my doubts.</p> <p>Later we slept. As soon as we awoke, I had a problem of taking it slower, but we were in the bed and, despite the awkwardness of the events of the past, it seemed just right. And, in my mind, it’s exactly right, she whispered.</p> <p>We didn’t say or do anything until after noon, when she left. I drove around the lake for a while, and found a secluded spot. We had been there a time or two during the day and it had felt wonderful. I sat close to her and felt her hand on my leg, looking in my eyes. It felt really good to have a woman touch me. I started to say, “I’m really glad we met,” and she leaned in, “I really am, too, for some reason.” She was still leaning in. “I don’t even know about the next step or how I’m getting to know you that well!”</p> <p>We talked, laughing and touching each other all the time, and I became very aware of her body. The fabric of her blouse was wet with desire, or maybe just her arousal. She pressed herself against me and, when I felt her nipple press against me, I gave it a slight squeeze. We talked, sharing some of the good times we had had. I was not a great listener, but I thought she was quite sincere. I think the first thing she really wanted to do was to run her tongue down my chest....</p> <p>The next day was Saturday. I was going to meet my girlfriend for dinner on the way home, but we arrived at the restaurant at about ten. She was wearing the same clothes she had worn yesterday, a red blouse and skirt. It was a nice, comfortable feeling, but, it was still a bit of a struggle to put on. I decided that maybe a little teasing was needed, and put my suit jacket on. Nothing like a good day at work. It was nice, being around this woman whose body looked a lot like mine.</p> <p>The evening wasn’t over until, after the first one of the day, we had a couple drinks and sat down to catch up, and talk. We had a great time, though it hadn’t been as fun as usual. My mind was made up, and, I was afraid for a change, I tried to feel like a man. Then I just relaxed into the moment. It hadn’t been the sex that we had experienced, though it had been certainly the sex with the sex being done to us. I felt pretty good, because I hadn’t had sex with anybody as many times as I had in my past, and there just had been a lot in the way of that. Then at one point, I took her out on the lake, the first, but not the last, but the last time we could have gone all the way naked. It had been different, too. It hadn’t been the—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
