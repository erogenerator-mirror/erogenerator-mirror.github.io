I smiled, thinking I had made him do the wrong thing. In the back of my mind, I was trying to tell myself that this had to be a terrible dream. The thought of a handsome, fit, athletic young man doing such things was a sin.</p> <p>My mind flashed back to that night, and my heart went out to him, wishing he would do the same things and not feel that I was wrong.</p> <p>That day I spent several hours looking at the pictures in my mind. Every time I stared at him, my nipples drew tiny circles on my chest and I wished I was looking at real life porn. My pussy got dampter and wetter, and it was time to get myself fucked. I started to go around and see if he was there, so I could have my fantasy fulfilled.</p> <p>On the way to the beach, I saw people at the bar and I wanted to come with them. My mind raced when I thought of the perfect man. I decided to be bold, and I walked into the water. It felt good, and there were people at the beach on the other side of the bar. The next thing I know, I found him laying on the beach in his towel staring at the ocean. He looked up at me and smiled, "Hi babe, how's it going?"</p> <p>"You're perfect!" I smiled brightly and walked toward him.</p> <p>As we walked toward each other, he grabbed my hips and pulled me close to him. He kissed me on the cheek. I turned to him and kissed him the same way, and he turned toward the people on the beach.</p> <p>We kissed tenderly for a second and then I walked up to the men. I wanted a real man, in real life, and I wanted him to take me. I pulled his swimsuit down, and had his cock in my hand. He was already hard, and so was I, so I sucked his dick.</p> <p>"Oh, yeah!" I heard him moan a bit and I smiled to myself.</p> <p>I sucked him, slowly at first, but then I moved faster, and I could tell he was getting close, so I pulled away and knelt down in front of him.</p> <p>"I want you in my mouth!" I hissed.</p> <p>"Why?" he replied, shocked.</p> <p>"Because if I swallow you'll be too busy to notice." I was giving him the option to say no or yes, but as he walked away from me, I wanted him to say yes. That's all I cared to hear. I sucked on his cock until his hips jerked and he came in my mouth. I swallowed it and got up to let him kiss me on the cheek, not quite ready to leave him all of the way home just yet. As I watched him, I wished I could see his face.</p> <p>By the time he got to me, the sun was already out and he pulled me down next to him. I could feel his hard body against mine and I sighed. He ran his hands down my arms to caress my breasts. I ran my fingers through his hair as my own hands slid down his chest and stomach to his cock. I slid over to straddle him and watched his face as my lips opened to his kiss. He kissed me back, and slid his hands up and down over my back, stopping once for a moment as I pulled his swimsuit to my eyelevel. I leaned forward so I could slide my lips across his. I ran my tongue down his neck and to his collarbone, and then back up again to his lips.</p> <p>I felt his hands slip under my ass and squeeze and squeeze me while we continued our kiss. His kisses were tender and soft, and I moaned into him. His hands slid up, and he cupped my face, then up to my breasts. He began to tease my nipples, running his fingers through my chest hair, pulling back my bra to show me his chest. He ran his thumbs over my nipples and I nearly melted. I felt his hips pressed up against me as his kisses became more urgent, and I wanted his hard cock.</p> <p>He broke the kiss and said, "Take off your panties."</p> <p>As I was trying to slide my panties down, he said, "You're so beautiful!" as he watched me getting my panties halfway down my thighs. I felt an intense tingle between my legs and when I raised my hips to help him, he slid them down. I had shaved down there the day before with the exception of my pubic hair; the only one I have. He looked down and I saw that he was staring at my shaved mound to which I had no problem.</p> <p>He took a step toward me and I lifted one knee, bringing my pussy to within a couple inches of his face. I brought my fingers to my lips and began to lickâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
