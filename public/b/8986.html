"I want you to feel what you're feeling, Master... I want to feel your love as much as you feel mine."</p> <p>Master smiled, his heart pounding so hard the sweat was dripping down his brow. "Then, I will allow you to share your thoughts with me," he told her with a laugh. "And I will make sure you know that you can have all you want from me."</p> <p>"Oh, thank you, Master," she said softly.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>"What are you doing?" She whispered. "What...?"</p> <p>"I'm... I'm going to fuck you," he quickly replied. "And I meant it. Don't move."</p> <p>He heard her start to pull herself up off of the chaise and then he heard her footsteps running toward the back bedroom and the front door opening. He waited a few moments then watched as she returned to the bed and crawled seductively onto the bed. He was now in no rush to leave, but just as quickly as it started he couldn't help but want to make this night as special to her as he could. He was more relaxed in his role, his body in total acceptance of their relationship than he'd ever imagined. She lay next to him, gently stroking his face as they looked into each other's eyes and then leaned over, kissing his lips and sucking his lip.</p> <p>"You are my best friend," she whispered. "I never want you to leave."</p> <p>"And your best friend? And you..."</p> <p>She chuckled. "Master, I was just thinking of how special I feel about you because of what I learned you taught me."</p> <p>"Well, I'm glad it was as beautiful a lesson as it was. Thank you."</p> <p>"I'm sure it was..."</p> <p>He reached out and touched her right shoulder softly. "It'll be alright."</p> <p>She giggled, her eyes locked on his. "I'm not sure I'm going to be able to say the same thing again..."</p> <p>"Well, we'll start off very slow," he assured her as he reached up and put a hand gently on her cheek. He then moved over her, moving one hand to gently lay her on her back with the other hand on her chest. He looked at her and saw that her eyes were glistening with excitement. He saw them sparkle with excitement and she started to reach up to stroke his cheek. "Shh, you have no idea how wonderful that is."</p> <p>She took a moment to bask in the warmth and softness of his arms before she reached up and pulled the towel from the bed and slowly sat up, running her fingers along his chin and down his neck. It wasn't an easy transition, he thought, as her hands kept lightly stroking his neck and shoulders. They'd never been this close to each other, never this intimately. He could tell she was feeling his strength and how it felt with her skin next to him. He saw her grin as she sat back down on the bed, taking the hand of his left hand in hers and turning it over to her left hand, placing it palm down on the sheets beneath her. "It's okay to stroke my hands," he told her as he kissed her lips and held his other hand out as if in prayer.</p> <p>She just smiled and then leaned over, laying her head on his shoulder. He felt her breath on his skin and his own warmth as he ran his hands up her legs and then around her body, pressing them together as he held her firmly. Her body felt beautiful, warm and soft against his, giving him an instant erection that was causing it back to form again. He felt his own heartbeat quicken as he watched her. His fingers slowly stroked her back, tracing small circles on her skin as she lay there taking them in and enjoying the feeling. He felt her body responding to his touch, pulling her closer, feeling her pulse throb and throb through his fingers.</p> <p>"Master?" she asked quietly, looking back and then placing them back on her chest. "Where are we going?"</p> <p>He looked at her face, taking in the expression on her face as she looked back at him. He watched as she licked her lips and then opened her eyes and stared at him with a smile before she quickly said, "You're my favorite. I don't mean to be too forward, Master, but I love your smile."</p> <p>"Oh, come on," he said gently, his mouth moving to kiss her again. "You're not being forward, you're just a friend. Your eyes were really shining with excitement and excitement as I watched you being stroked."</p> <p>"I don't want to tease you any longer, Master," she saidâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
