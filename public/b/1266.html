Do you like sucking it, huh?"</p> <p>"Oh, I love it."</p> <p>"Is that why your Mom said you aren't going home until Christmas?"</p> <p>"Yeah. But I still can't really make her do it. I guess she thinks I'm a pervert."</p> <p>"You are an adult now, and I think you will do just fine. I mean, look at that cute little cunt of yours right now. Do you like sucking cock? You are one hot little slut."</p> <p>"Can't do it, Bobby. But it is fun."</p> <p>"I hope so, mom. It's the least I can do for your birthday."</p> <p>"Mmmm. And it's the least I can do for my little man."</p> <p>"Maybe just a little later, mom."</p> <p>"I already want to suck my son's cock."</p> <p>"And I still want it."</p> <p>"I'll bet you a million dollars you want it too bad."</p> <p>"Maybe just a little later," she answered.</p> <p>"What time are you coming home?"</p> <p>"I don't know. I really need to pick up a pizza first, but I'll talk to you later."</p> <p>"That's alright, sweetheart. I'll talk to you later."</p> <p>After giving his mother a good-bye kiss and a peck on her cheek, Bobby turned back toward the parking lot and watched her car pull away as it sped off down the street. He sighed. It wasn't a year ago that he decided to give into a crazy desire. He would never do something like that again. It wasn't fun or exciting. It wasn't even like he wanted to try and get involved with another married woman.</p> <p>It was hard, he realized. For him it was just wrong, but for her it was a pleasure, a thrill. He had just turned his life around, made himself a sexual being and then his mom turned it upside down. He didn't like what she was doing. Well, not anymore. He didn't want to say what he felt towards her, but he knew he was wrong. He didn't like it. That was a part of it. Still, he wondered, 'Was it really that bad? Am I just doing it because she asked me to?'"</p> <p>Bobby stood there in an empty room that had once been a bedroom. He couldn't remember the last time he had been standing in this room. He felt the chair that was in front of his desk. It was empty. When he sat down he felt a shiver go down his spine.</p> <p>In the shadows that lined the wall, one of the doors had opened on it, and he could see a dim corridor through the dim room. He sat next to a naked, reclined, white wife. She was sitting with her legs dangling apart on the floor. Her arms were bound behind her back. The black panties rested on the carpeted floor below her. The bra was missing but the panties had been torn off while he and his brother had been masturbating.</p> <p>"I'll think about it," she said, her eyes closed. "Come on, Bobby."</p> <p>"Where are you going?" he asked, not knowing if there were any other people in the room. "I want to do something."</p> <p>"Why?"</p> <p>"Bobby, you can't ever find out that I'm not getting it, I really shouldn't do it, and I don't want to get caught by my husband or any man for that matter."</p> <p>"Oh, that's too bad," he said with a little laugh.</p> <p>At the same time, he felt himself becoming aroused, he was beginning to like it. He wasn't sure of himself. The girl with the dark bra that was in the darkness was his mother, but it had been over 20 years. It's kind of scary to think of her that way. There was no doubt that it was his mom, too. The thought made him smile.</p> <p>"Bobby," she said, her voice soft, even. "Just do it. It's nothing wrong. You're a handsome young man. We can talk later."</p> <p>Bobby stood and walked over to the bed. He sat down and turned the dial on his bedside table.</p> <p>"How much do you want to do?" he asked.</p> <p>"You'll probably have to tell me."</p> <p>"Okay. Tell me. It'll be fun."</p> <p>"You're the one who thinks, you mean," she said, as she unclasped her bra and let her tits spill out. "My tits are so big I can barely get them out."</p> <p>"You look so good with them hanging out," he said.</p> <p>"No, Bobby. They're not hanging out," heâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
