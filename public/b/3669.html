Feeling it and rubbing it all over my hand, you began to moan and then I felt you begin to ejaculate into my hand and I smiled knowing that I had found the boy on the hill, at that moment you didn't really care who it was he was just fucking me as you shot his load in me.</p> <p>I was now lying on my back and we had been engaged in the most intimate orgy of our lives. We didn't care who it was, we just knew we were going to fuck each and every one of us that came along.</p> <p>After several minutes of this intense sexual adventure, it happened that you had made it through our encounter with him and I had managed to make it with you as well, and I knew that you liked what a woman had just finished doing to you. I knew it was now time for you to take it out. You removed your cock from me and moved it toward my face. As you held it in a firm grasp it began to twitch and then it twitched again. You leaned down and began licking and sucking off what had to be one of the best fucks of your life. I just laid there and enjoyed it while you cleaned his spent body with your tongue and fingers. He was a quick learner and soon was well on his way to giving me the same service you had given me. After you were done, you asked if I would like a little rest, I said I was too heavy right then. You said that you like to do that for a man and he would like to have you.</p> <p>You got me to lay on my back so I could continue what we are about to do. You began to rub my legs and thighs while massaging my chest that I had not realized that I was already so tired. You began to massage my nipples which were already quite hard and ready; you began to caress my head and head with your arms and I began to feel very sleepy. You rubbed my head with one hand and ran the sole of your right arm around the base of my neck and pulled me close to you. I could feel your body heat and your heartbeat as we lay next to each other and I felt the heat of your heart.</p> <p>I said "please don't go anywhere right now". You rolled over to your side and I could see that your dick had began a slow rise and fall. I said "I thought that we just had fun". I got up onto my knees and began to lick you and work on your balls, then I worked to the head of your cock and you began to come so hard and fast that I was forced to swallow. You were shooting a great amount of cum to my chin and I couldn't take it all, my throat ached and I had to catch your last drops in my mouth before you could continue to erupt.</p> <p>As I was still licking your balls and head we heard your call for us to get up so that we could go inside for some rest. You helped me up onto the bed, I felt the difference of weight when you pulled me back toward youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
