She was so sweet and her skin so soft that I could have been lost in the softest skin ever. I had a feeling that I'd be wanting to feel her forever. But even if someone was just about to marry her, maybe she wouldn't have to know the difference in me. As long as we weren't alone, it seemed only natural I should feel it with her. I could be a lot of things if I wanted to, but that doesn't mean I would be stupid about marrying someone. Or maybe I would be a lot of things if I really wanted to be with someone.</p> <p>The idea of going slow after marrying her was one of those things that was so alien to me that I couldn't get the urge to stop again.</p> <p>"I think you need to go see her."</p> <p>"Yeah, sure," she replied softly.</p> <p>"It'd be nice if... if you could stay?"</p> <p>"Sure, I would love that if I could stay that long."</p> <p>"That'd be great."</p> <p>With that I picked up the phone and made the call.</p> <p>"Hello?"</p> <p>"I hope you're staying!"</p> <p>Oh yes, I was still married, I could still be with her. I thought if we decided to break up soon I could be really happy, but if we did that there was no chance of us ever sleeping together or making it permanent. So I hung up the phone and went back to my clothes and started putting on a robe.</p> <p>The house was empty; my friends and family left around four in the morning. I wondered what happened with me when they all went to bed on the same bed together. I heard the door open then close, and then a few seconds later a noise and then footsteps walking down the stairs. I took a deep breath, closed my eyes and waited. This would probably be the end of the phone call.</p> <p>"Hello?"</p> <p>"Honey, its Sarah."</p> <p>"Yes, who is this?"</p> <p>"Sarah," she said sounding surprised.</p> <p>"I thought we were finally going to break up."</p> <p>"Yeah, you were all right."</p> <p>I wasn't at all angry, not with her, but I felt as if we had been married too long and that this was something we needed to do.</p> <p>"It's just, I'm just scared that I'm going to be with my ex."</p> <p>"Honey, you aren't even with me anymore."</p> <p>"But it's just the same as it was before?"</p> <p>"Yeah, it's just different," she answered honestly.</p> <p>I decided we would talk about it when we got home that night. Hopefully she would understand, but not to me.</p> <p>***********************************</p> <p>The two days flew by and I decided to start getting ready at a local salon to start getting my hair done before work on Friday. For six months before and after I met my husband I hadn't been in a salon since I had a baby, and since I just graduated from college I started getting ready just a little less extravagantly. This meant I was really starting to get a good buzz from trying out makeup, and more time on the makeup shop. It also meant getting a good workout in to help me along.</p> <p>The more time it took me to get ready the better, and with that I started to enjoy a fun time at home.</p> <p>My husband Mike was an avid golfer, and he was never far from me. He never even tried to drive his Jeep down at the first swing. As I mentioned before I had been taking a lot of exercise. Not to worry about it, I just went out to the gym for six months and then to the gym for three months just to keep from losing my weight.</p> <p>That being said, my physical appearance wasn't that great. I wasn't the best looking mother around, but I was a woman who did her fair share of the work, and I loved it. Plus, my body had gotten a little thinner and my boobs were a little smaller, so the extra pounds that came with being pregnant seemed to come in handy with being pregnant.</p> <p>My body got back into shape the last six months and I started to develop a decent body all the time. At this time I was in the same neighborhood with Mike and was beginning to look good and I started to flirt with other neighbors. One thing that I really liked about Mike and his wife was that they were both totally open people. They never sat on my lawn at 7:30 AM except at their jobs and no one would ask why.</p> <p>About ten days after we started dating, Mike came home from work. I asked him what was going on and he justâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
