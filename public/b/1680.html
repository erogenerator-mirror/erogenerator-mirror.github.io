She looked over at me and I just took a deep breath before following her lead. We went through the same old routine where we did as she went by and just carried on.</p> <p>"So do you want to take longer again?" she asked.</p> <p>I just nodded and reached down to get up. She looked over at me and I just kept on coming to terms with what we must have been doing.</p> <p>"If you need another handjob, we can stop as we are. It's okay though. If you need more time, we can continue. Do you want to?" and with that she smiled and took my hand and led me over to the bed.</p> <p>I looked round and couldn't believe what I was seeing. She lay down on bed and started to move her body around and I could feel her getting horny again. So I got up and joined her and we lay on the bed for a while kissing and caressing each other.</p> <p>"I never knew sex could be this amazing," I said.</p> <p>She started giggling and pulled me over to her and said, "You always said that sex was a one-time thing and I still can't believe it."</p> <p>"I guess you're right," I said, "It's just not the same thing as with you, but it's definitely better now that I know how it made a difference."</p> <p>And with that we got out of bed and went back downstairs. We found her dad at the table and we all sat round drinking tea.</p> <p>"He's still got a problem over there," said Tina, "I'll fix that."</p> <p>"No problem. It was good of you."</p> <p>We were all in a sort of giggly mood as we finished our tea and then Tina headed off to the toilet. All the boys were watching us and we were both laughing and joking about how silly we were being all the time.</p> <p>"Don't be such a mess," said Helen as she entered the room, "I'll bet these boys can hardly get it up." She was grinning and so were most of the other boys around for that matter and they both gave us a knowing glance, before we all went off to the toilets.</p> <p>She went towards the toilets and when we got back, she gave me a hug and said, "I'll always take care of you when you need it." She gave me a kiss on my cheek and then she was gone.</p> <p>I carried on with the tea and we returned to the bar. We were just waiting for the waiter when he came over and asked if we were all going to join him for a cup of tea. Tina, Helen and Paula were already there and the two of them began to chat with him as we all sat around drinking.</p> <p>After he got over a drink, he picked up Tina and dragged her back to her room. Then he pushed her out the door and threw Paula over his shoulder as he headed back up the stairs. As he went up his feet were wet with water as they made quick work of getting under the shower.</p> <p>Paula came out of the bathroom wrapped in a towel and I looked at her. She looked stunning in an expensive, satin robe. Her hair was still damp and hung down her back in all directions from her shoulders to her ass.</p> <p>"How do you fancy getting into town?"</p> <p>"I have a bit of a drive to get back so would you like to buy me a burger or something?"</p> <p>She smiled at me and said, "You know I like you to say this when I'm being a tramp. How about lunch? Then you can stay with me or go back home. I'll pay for the bed and we can shower together."</p> <p>Before I could suggest what she was implying, she just went off to the toilet and came back. I sat at the bar where I hadn't been to this point and had no idea what to eat.</p> <p>When Pauline returned we all got up to find Helen and Tina chatting with the restaurant's manager at the other end. They were sitting close on the bench between a couple of small tables. They were chatting away as Tina's hand found that of one of Tina's large breasts and it went right on back to a nipple.</p> <p>Pauline and I went to the bar and had a little lunch in front of Helen and Tina. We went back to the other end of the bar and sat down with Tina.</p> <p>"Have you guys heard from Simon," she asked.</p> <p>"I can't really."</p> <p>"He hasn't called," she said, "but he will soon. Anyway, he got a phone call about a week ago and he said he'd like to take a message. He wants to hear the details of your marriage. You and I will join him in the pub about then.
