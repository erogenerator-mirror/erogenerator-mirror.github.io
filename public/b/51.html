His erection was sticking out on top of him as he leaned back against the couch, I slid my hand around my stomach and then up to rest it on top of his. He was still leaning back against the couch, which left his whole dick exposed for easy exploration. The whole scene was just surreal, so surreal that we never really noticed we were staring.</p> <p>When he finally lifted his hand, I slowly moved my hand away from his body and placed it on his shoulder before wrapping my other hand around it and pulling him out from behind me. I then began running my hand all over his hard cock again as we continued our kissing.</p> <p>"We should move to the bedroom," I murmured, "We'll need to go to my room before I do this."</p> <p>With that, we both went upstairs and quickly undressed, we found the bedroom he was supposed to be staying in, and as soon as I pulled off my wet underwear and laid down on the bed I was already pulling off my jeans and he quickly followed as I quickly pulled off his socks. The whole time he sat and watched us while I slowly stroked myself, it was so erotic looking at him and feeling his body next to me with that big, hard dick pointing directly at my face, waiting and wanting.</p> <p>I couldn't get enough of it when I finally saw the outline of his dick and then I couldn't help but feel my own dick start swelling as we kissed and rubbed each other off.</p> <p>"Fuck, I'm about to cum right here," he said in frustration as my hand was sliding back and forth against the wall.</p> <p>But I was quick to keep stroking him, making sure he never missed a spot, so we quickly maneuvered into the classic 69 position and began kissing again. We both loved what we were doing, we didn't know how to do it, but he made sure we had at least a good time in this way before we got back to it again, and to my delight, we made a couple of new ones that were a little more fun than I thought were possible.</p> <p>I felt him start to move, he couldn't wait to have his first dick inside of him once more, and so while I continued to work him over, I used my tongue to try to find the underside of his dick.</p> <p>There it was, the soft, smooth head of his dick, I really enjoyed the taste of this particular one. The skin was soft and smooth and tasted just like I remembered, the only difference being in how much I liked it was the slightly salty texture of it and the way it was slightly salty on the lips...the way I had noticed the difference in when I was having dinner, and not sure how to describe what I was tasting in that way.</p> <p>I had never felt anyone who enjoyed it so much as him, and I really liked it when he was hard for me like that also. I continued to try and lick each of his balls, and then around each of his dick, trying to keep him in me as much as possible. It was such a rush when I had his dick in my little mouth, and as I felt my own dick getting as hard as it had been in minutes, so I knew how to do this a little better. I tried to concentrate on just doing the best I could, and trying to be as quiet as I could as he came into my mouth and filled it, until we had to separate.</p> <p>I didn't have to stop at all, he came back to me and our bodies pressed together in a slow sensual embrace as his dick slid back between my legs once more.</p> <p>"Well, what do you think," I purred as I held his dick with one hand and stroked his ass with the other. "Do you have a hard dick?"</p> <p>"Yeah, I do," he said as his eyes went wide, "I had the best part."</p> <p>"Good. It was a nice one."</p> <p>With that, we ended up rolling so he was again on his back while I knelt over him. His dick was hard and standing up right at attention while I started slowly working my lips around the head, which made him arch his hips so I could take him easier. It was such a turn on to finally feel that big dick as my lips slid down to my tongue to gently tickle around the rim of him before moving up to gently rub the head while I ran my tongue around the head and around the head. He had his hands in my hair while I worked on him for what seemed like forever, eventually coming up to his hips to try and hold on, but couldn't stop sliding them on so I kept working him down while taking him back in so that I could slide it in.</p> <p>Thenâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
