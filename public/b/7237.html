"But since then my life has changed. I've got a lot on my mind."</p> <p>"I'm not sure I can wait, baby."</p> <p>They kissed and kissed some more until he started to run his hand over her naked body. "My turn in the showers," he said and pulled his shorts down and stood up. "Come on, baby, feel my big, hot cock as you wash me."</p> <p>Cheryl slowly turned him around and bent down to hold him against her. "You were right, baby. I missed your mouth," she murmured against his neck as she rubbed his cock head with the outside of her hand. "This will be a very special night."</p> <p>"So long, little lady," he groaned against her lips. "This feels so good."</p> <p>Then she pulled back, looked into his eyes and kissed him once, before she turned him toward the shower. It was another first, and she never did it again. But it felt so sensual.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Cheryl had just returned from her evening out when she heard someone call her name from behind her. "What can I do for you?" she heard the voice say.</p> <p>"It's Cheryl," Cheryl said.</p> <p>"Your husband called," he said. "I was in the shower when he called to make sure you weren't going to the movies."</p> <p>Cheryl's husband, Todd, lived a couple of townspeople's miles from Cheryl's husband but his wife couldn't find her anywhere.</p> <p>"Oh, no don't," Cheryl said. "He told me that he thought I should go out with friends."</p> <p>Todd saw her eyes light up as he took her in hand and led her past him and the bathroom. He followed her across the bathroom as the water was turning warm and he stood behind Cheryl's husband in the steam room. Cheryl was wearing a short red dress that plunged at the middle and showed off her generous cleavage.</p> <p>Cheryl turned and kissed Todd as Todd slowly bent down and touched her nipples with his lips.</p> <p>"We don't have a deal," Todd said as Cheryl dropped to her knees in front of him. She then took his cock head in her mouth, bobbed up and down on it, and pulled his foreskin back before she took it out. She wrapped her lips around the turgid, red head of his cock and sucked on it greedily, then slowly pulled it from her mouth and let go with a pop. She had Todd sitting on the edge of the tiled shower bench and turned, kneeling in front of him. She took it into her hand and placed his cock head at the entrance to her mouth and slowly slid it into her mouth. Todd was in heaven. His wife was a total slut, sucking his cock. Todd knew that he would be shooting load after load into Cheryl's mouth in no time at all. She was a natural, he had never seen such a gorgeous, sexy woman sucking a cock. He watched as she bobbed up and down on his cock shaft.</p> <p>Cheryl reached up and grabbed the cheeks of his ass. She pulled his ass cheek high and he moaned as his cock head was pressed against the roof of her mouth. She massaged his balls with her right hand as her left hand jerked him off. Todd could feel himself nearing climax and pulled his head back.</p> <p>"Not yet," he said as he pushed Cheryl away.</p> <p>He then turned her around so that she was bent over in the shower. He knelt behind her and rubbed his throbbing cock on the opening of her pussy which was already soaking wet. He pushed in, felt the resistance as the opening to her pussy opened and his cock slid slowly into her warm depths.</p> <p>"Oh my God," Cheryl sighed as Todd's thick cock slid slowly into her pussy. He reached up and grabbed her nipples between his thumb and forefinger then pulled them away and rolled them between his fingers while he fucked her.</p> <p>Todd loved watching his cock slide in and out of Cheryl's pussy as she wrapped her legs around his waist. This time, instead of pulling out, Todd pushed back in and felt her pussy squeeze his cock. He leaned forward, kissing his wife as he went in and out of her tight vagina.</p> <p>Todd leaned forward again, pulling his cock half-way out and then thrusting forward once again as he fucked his wife. Cheryl moaned each time he thrust forward. A feeling of joy was overwhelming him as he fucked her. "Your pussy feels so good!" he thought as he fucked her.</p> <p>Todd felt himself ready to blow in her pussy any second and just kept on fucking her as his cock moved in and out of her pussy. He felt him approaching orgasm and pulled outâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
