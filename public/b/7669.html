Are there things you like that don't include wearing clothes?"</p> <p>"No, but I've always been a good kid for sure. "I haven't done anything but sunbathe in years..."</p> <p>He laughed again, and she noticed his smile. She knew it was a good thing too. When he finished eating she turned to make herself something to drink and a cool drink to read...that's all the motivation that had been on her mind...</p> <p>~~</p> <p>~~</p> <p>The second they arrived they saw that there were about a hundred or so houses up front, so Jake made them way up to the main gate to the beach area, hoping the housekeeping would also be up. Jake tried to find them, and she gave him some directions, and a lot of food, but he was beginning to worry that he was going to fail and get kicked out. He tried to call on his cellphone but the phone just went off.</p> <p>"Can't you find them anywhere?" His father yelled.</p> <p>"Yes, I've found them, I'm trying to get the coast view on the water. "He said, laughing.</p> <p>"No, you've been here almost four hours since you got a chance to get a good swim...I don't think you're going to be able to swim."</p> <p>"What are you talking about? What's going on with the neighbors?"</p> <p>"Well, when I saw what you were doing up in the house you weren't even thinking of the kids. One of the neighbors, a woman, is one of them...and her son was playing basketball."</p> <p>"So, they can't swim around the beach...and what are you talking about?"</p> <p>Before she could explain further she felt him leaning her way and the hands went to her waist. He pulled her close, and she felt him kiss her...and all over her face. They were still in the water and she knew there was nothing she could do but melt into him and kiss him back. He made sure her hips rubbed up against his cock and the water. He turned her around and turned her to face the pool. He began to unbutton her blouse and put it over her shoulders. Her breasts were full and so was her body. He took one big breast in each hand and rubbed his thumbs over her nipples, making her moan and writhe on his hand. He undid his belt, unzipped his fly, pulled out his hard cock, and began to stroke it. He rubbed her clit with one hand, while the other worked his cock. She arched her back and thrust her hips up to meet his hand, and began to moan loudly...when he slipped a finger inside her and she almost came right there. She wanted him inside her and now. They switched places and his face found hers. As they kissed he began to stroke his cock. She knew she would not last long. But, before she could let a squirt of juice come it hit the wall and made a huge smacking noise. Jake began to thrust faster, and her hands gripped the sides of the pool. He made her cum twice more...and then they came together, his cum shooting into her hand.</p> <p>He laid her down, and was about to leave when she reached for her cell phone...just before it came he grabbed her and they began to kiss again. She was wet, but not from the rain, and her lips were all swollen and swollen. Her eyes were closed and her arms were around him, but she could feel her wetness all the way down to her ass cheek.</p> <p>~~</p> <p>The next day, Jake was feeling better all around. His father was still out and he was walking the beach with a large group of people. He knew the neighborhood, and knew they'd never go far. The group had been walking for close to an hour. The neighbors had a number of friends, but Jake had felt a little uncomfortable. Maybe a little jealous, because she'd told him his mom was away. There was something in her eyes...that he couldn't quite place, but he knew it was there.</p> <p>He tried to make small talk with the person behind him. No, he knew he shouldn't. The man was older than him, and looked vaguely familiar. He was young, but he had a nice smile, which looked a little tired. He looked so hot in his wet shirt, those wet stains on it. He walked next to someone, and they looked interested. The other man, he figured, was a couple of years older...maybe it hadâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
