"Oh Jesus!" she thought "Oh yes, oh yes! Yes!"</p> <p>She could feel herself tightening and the tension tightened again and suddenly she felt her vagina spasming in ecstasy as her body was racked with sensations from the best orgasm anyone could ever remember.</p> <p>"Oh fuck!" she thought "I'm cumming again!" as her muscles gripped his hair and she felt her fluids flowing over his tongue.</p> <p>Just as she felt her vagina winding down completely, she heard the door open. There was no doubt that she was in trouble, but it was too late now. Before the intruder could even react, the door began to open again, but this time it was different this time.</p> <p>"Oh my goodness! It's Laura!" she exclaimed.</p> <p>"What are you doing?" he exclaimed, but in reply he was already in the hallway.</p> <p>As they continued along the hallway, he stood in one corner, his eyes scanning the darkness.</p> <p>"No, it's okay," she said, reaching for the light switch.</p> <p>The sound of it had the effect of flashing on her. She turned back to him, her legs opening wide as she took him into her arms again. They locked their mouths together in a kiss that grew more intense the closer it got.</p> <p>Laura was getting turned on at having his hard cock pressed against her belly through their clothes. She pulled back to look at it, wondering what it would look like if she would get a chance to try it. He seemed to realize her thoughts and grabbed her by the shoulders again, his hands now at her waist.</p> <p>"I'm ready!" he promised, and pushed her backward until she was on her back on the carpet, and again they parted.</p> <p>"Do you want me again?" he asked, then went down on his knees and took her pussy into his mouth again.</p> <p>"Yes! It feels so good!" she moaned.</p> <p>"Don't worry, I'll make you cum again."</p> <p>"Good."</p> <p>He slid a finger into her and then withdrew it and slid it into her ass up to the first knuckle. The sensations were intense and she thought she must have passed out, but the second finger was replaced quickly by the thick finger.</p> <p>"Oh fuck!" she thought. "I can't take this. It's too much!" she thought.</p> <p>The intruder's lips felt tight on hers and his tongue invaded her mouth with its demanding tongue. She wrapped her legs around his waist again, locking them together as he pushed his throbbing penis against her pussy with his hand. "Yes!" she thought.</p> <p>"Oh yeah!" he agreed. "This is it!" he exclaimed.</p> <p>"Yes, more!" she cried back.</p> <p>He slid his finger out of her ass and then slid his finger into her, just as he said he would. Laura was getting off again, as well as he. She thought she could hear his heart beating as his body moved in and out of her and she was getting hotter by the second. He pulled his finger out of her ass and held it up to her mouth for her to lick. She looked around. No one could see.</p> <p>"I think you know what it tastes like." she thought. "And you can tell."</p> <p>He then put his cock back into her and pushed it all the way in, pushing it up against her belly. The pleasure was incredible and it made his heart pound.</p> <p>They were both still for a long time. For several minutes they simply lay there like that and he felt her breathing quicken. It was starting to get to him and she knew she had to cum.</p> <p>"Do you want me in you? Do you want my sperm?"</p> <p>"Yes!" she cried out. "Yes."</p> <p>He pushed his penis all the way in one stroke and held it there as she came. She felt so full and he held his penis tightly, pressing it firmly against her as she convulsed again and again. His fingers felt so good as they played with her clit, then she thought she knew what she wanted him to do.</p> <p>Her legs were up around his waist, holding themselves together, and his hand went around to her ass and squeezed her cheek as he slid his penis in and out of her. He kept it up until she started to feel her passion rising again.</p> <p>"Oh Jesus!" she thought "This is so good!" and she pulled herself tight against his body. He was inside her now, his erection fully embedded in her.</p> <p>"It's your turn now," she thought. "Put some more sperm on my lips and then I'll suck itâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
