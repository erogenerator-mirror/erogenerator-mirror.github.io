"You've been a real sweet girl, too. So, uh, how was your party?"</p> <p>"Well, I suppose being the center of attention wasn't too bad." She started looking around the room. "I don't remember most of the costumes, or even what any of the names really were, but when I looked around I realized that this was the first one of our party that was going to be full."</p> <p>"Is that just a costume, or does the real deal look like one?"</p> <p>"I know I look like a girl, but I'd rather know what I look like from the looks of men than for a picture on a postcard." She put her hand on her leg. "And, I've been trying to find a costume that fits me well enough to make me feel more like a woman, but I can't find anything quite like that either."</p> <p>"I can't help it if you put the costume into another costume, just so that they can see what you have for the rest of the day." He had been getting a huge smile on his face the whole time.</p> <p>"Oh, right. I had a very good time, too. I didn't really notice that the others were as dressed up as they were." She held up a piece of paper and began writing. "And, they were more than happy to show me their costumes and give me free entry to the costume contest if they could have the chance to put a name tag on me. But, there was a big fight of sorts that night, and that was just the way I was raised."</p> <p>"Well, I'll go get you some costumes, so you could just show up in it and let everyone know that they can't have the free entry."</p> <p>"I could do that." She gave him a quick hug and got out of the shower before he could get out of his pants.</p> <p>She handed him his costume while he showered the rest, and he put it on, then started getting dressed himself. "I'll be right back," he called as he made his way back out to his costume.</p> <p>*************</p> <p>On the bus ride back to the club, Mark was in his usual "nice to see you here" mode. He wondered if he could get through the entire night in this outfit. Once again, the ride over to the house was filled with the usual stuff on a Friday night and then a few more minutes later he got into the "oldies" club before being summoned to the dance floor. After the first song he was having a hard time getting through. They were all in a row on the dance floor and had to shuffle back and forth back and forth, the floor not too many feet away from his face. He had never been a pole dancer, so he had no idea how to pick songs, but everyone was having a good time. A couple of females got up there alone and danced with him, but none of them were as good as Karen. When a couple of the girls came up to him, he asked the woman that he barely knew, if she could dance with him.</p> <p>"I'm looking for a dance partner so that I can really get into the music and really turn around an inch. And, I want to be in the center of the dance floor while they do."</p> <p>"Don't bother. There's room in the back of the room, and I can let them take off their clothes if they want to." She sat down as he sat down, and as he started to stand up, she stepped back to get a better look at the guy in the black vest. He had his arms raised over his body, and some of his hair was hanging down as he rubbed it across his face.</p> <p>"Well, you're a quick start. Do you think you can manage to come up with some music that will take the pressure off?"</p> <p>"I can come up with nothing."</p> <p>After the two women left, and after some more dancing, he asked Karen if there was a chance for him to come up with something to do while the women danced.</p> <p>"I don't have to do anything."</p> <p>"But, I want some music, if you know what I mean." He saw that the other two women were already dancing together, and he was beginning to notice some of the moves that had been put on them earlier and found it easier than he thought.</p> <p>"There's a great place, though."</p> <p>"Really?"</p> <p>"Yes, really." She took his hands and put them on her hips and led him over to the bar. "Come on, get a beer and sit down."</p> <p>"I'm having a hard time. The only thing I'm interested in is dancing."</p> <p>"Well, just sit down. We'll get you started on some music, since you're just sitting thereâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
