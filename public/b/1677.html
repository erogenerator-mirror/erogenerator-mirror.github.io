It's that I can't take any more pain and so I can't take anymore." He said.</p> <p>He had tears in his eyes as he tried to pull away, "I'm sorry too, I don't know what came over me, but I don't care about any of that. I've got to go; I've gotta go and get some groceries, the manager said I was leaving."</p> <p>"It's okay honey. I'll never forget you, but I don't think you can make up your mind to keep it. So I guess I'll leave; I'm sure you'll want to hang out with me until you go." She said as she handed him his beer and walked into the house.</p> <p>He made his way through the kitchen and up to the living room where he collapsed on the couch. He watched as she walked toward him, he had never seen her before, but then again she had looked up at him a lot since the moment she came to his office. He wondered if it was for the same reason she seemed to be following him all his life, to escape the pain she was feeling, he knew that she had to leave. He watched as she walked out of the kitchen then went into the other room and slammed the door.</p> <p>He sat for a while longer before deciding to go into the bathroom for some relief. He took a cold shower, brushed his teeth, washed and shaved his face, and made up his face. He wanted to get back into the game, but there wasn't time.</p> <p>He turned on the faucet at the sink and let his thoughts run free. He thought of how it would be to meet her again, how it could mean everything, it meant everything. He didn't have a steady girlfriend for nearly 9 years, maybe even 6, but after that... well, she was definitely different.</p> <p>A little while later, he decided he needed more caffeine and headed out into the main room so he could hear her. The woman beside him who had followed him through the kitchen had looked at him and just smiled so he just followed her. He felt stupid, and he knew it made him feel like he was some criminal.</p> <p>They made eye contact briefly while he had to adjust to being alone in a strange city. She told him she didn't think he really had a girlfriend anymore. She also told him he didn't want to leave, but she didn't know either.</p> <p>When she stood up, there was a twinkle in her eye, something that he had not seen for very long. It was her eyes that had gotten him, and she was looking at him again with a look only you could say was intense.</p> <p>"Hello, I wanted to thank you so much for coming out tonight." The woman said as she leaned in to give him an even closer look. "I wanted to do this for you, you look tired; if you need anything, feel free to leave."</p> <p>"No thanks, I'm fine" he answered with a confused look on his face.</p> <p>"No sorry, please call me Susan, I can't keep my phone by myself, I know it's not your call, but I don't care, please call me anytime." She said as she looked him over as if she was appraising him.</p> <p>"Oh. I didn't know it was you." He said.</p> <p>"No, that was my assistant at the hotel. She's been helping me since early yesterday."</p> <p>"That's wonderful, I'm flattered that you found someone else to help you so soon." He said feeling a little foolish, how could he be so wrong? He could almost have been in her shoes had he been interested in her.</p> <p>"So are you staying up and staying the night?" He watched her walk over to him holding a small overnight bag. "No you stay up, I'm not going to wait for you, and anyway I know how to get to you and I'm sure you'll be ready by morning."</p> <p>"I don't know..." he tried to say, but it came out as a slur, "I've got to go to the airport early, I can't let the night go on by myself, if I stay here I need to get ready first."</p> <p>"Oh you're going to do fine," She said with a smile as she handed him his bag and kissed him on the hand.</p> <p>He sat at the kitchen table for a little while, and decided he was ready, he had to catch up with her and find out exactly what her plan was. He could see the smile on her face, and realized how much he looked forward to what was to come.</p> <p>When he got home he showered and changed quickly, got all the necessary things heâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
