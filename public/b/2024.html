She placed them on one of the shelves for me, but not before giving them a hard tug at the side of them. I stood for a moment, letting her hand wonder, enjoying the touch. I bent over to get the pillows, making sure to use them as cushions under my ass.</p> <p>"The bed. On the other side of the room, on the bed."</p> <p>I got onto the bed, and then knelt to remove my sandals and slip into it. It was cold, and the sheets were a soft, dark gray, and the light reflected off my bare skin. I turned, sliding the comforter over me.</p> <p>"That's a long journey."</p> <p>"It will have to wait."</p> <p>I heard the door open, and was happy when it closed again.</p> <p>"Well, have fun. And you're free whenever."</p> <p>I smiled at the statement, but she knew just how I felt.</p> <p>***</p> <p>"Hello, Mistress," my husband walked into the bedroom, walking past me.</p> <p>"Good morning, dear. I hope it's not too bad."</p> <p>"It's more than that. This has been a long week."</p> <p>"Good. You had fun with us last night? You did a good job with that toy though, my Pet."</p> <p>"We did. Your husband showed interest in me before the evening. I can't believe I did that."</p> <p>"Yes, well, you are a beautiful young woman. It is all about how you feel. And I could give you pleasure if you were truly good."</p> <p>He smiled at me when I walked past him on my way back to the kitchen. But he was thinking about what I had just done with my husband, and he kept his attention focused on what he had done with me. He smiled when I returned, knowing I was a very good subject.</p> <p>When I put the bowl of scrambled eggs in front of him, he got up with a chuckle.</p> <p>"Well, well, well. How's that?"</p> <p>I laughed. "I'm hungry. Do you want an eggs Benedict? Or maybe some bacon and eggs."</p> <p>"Well, I don't think you'd like an eggs Benedict, but don't worry. The only thing we have to worry about is the cooking." He raised his eyebrow suggestively, and I just laughed again.</p> <p>"I'll pick up the plates of the rest of the dishes."</p> <p>"Oh, no. I don't have a plate here, so I'll just take yours."</p> <p>I took a plate and a fork and carried them to the kitchen while he went to get another plate. He came back with a plate for me.</p> <p>"This might be a bit unusual, but I think this is the appropriate attire."</p> <p>I nodded, and he leaned in to kiss me. He was kissing my lips tenderly but with a growing urgency. I had wanted that moment for so long. I had to pull him away.</p> <p>I got another plate, and set it on the other side of the kitchen table. He returned and sat down between us. We sat smiling.</p> <p>"There you go." His voice was a little rough. "This is the traditional breakfast. I'll just have some scrambled eggs on your side," he picked my plate and went to get another set.</p> <p>I moved to give him room, but he grabbed it and sat on the other side of the table. There was no need for him to do that. I felt safe with him, and I didn't care if he said "Thank you" or "If you're sure," but the next thing I know, he's pressing his lips gently against mine and pushing them apart.</p> <p>I smiled up at him, seeing the need in his eyes and the desire his lips had. I wanted him more than my wife and my husband, and I wanted him right now. To be honest, I was kind of proud of myself for my courage. With a laugh, I looked across toward our guest as we ate. He was looking very excited, and obviously loving everything about the conversation this morning.</p> <p>I looked back to the stove in the dining room, where the eggs were waiting.</p> <p>"Would you like me to give you a couple of minutes?" I asked quietly.</p> <p>A bit of a surprise on his part, he nodded without thinking about it.</p> <p>"Yes. Please." I felt a tingle just hearing him say it.</p> <p>He reached over to pick the plate off the table and took a fork.</p> <p>"Goâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
