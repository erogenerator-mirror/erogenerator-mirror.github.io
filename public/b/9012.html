She got up and straddled me, pushing my arms down to my side, then she reached down and pulled my shirt off. Then I felt her hands on my chest, then, she gently ran her fingers through my chest hair. She started again, and she gently kissed my nipples, then she slowly kissed one then the other. I felt her tongue run over my nipple, and her wet tongue rubbed and rubbed on it as if it were a vibrator. I moaned and put an arm under her shoulders to try and control her movement. She slid a hand up, and caressed my left breast.</p> <p>"I want to suck those wonderful nipples," she said. "I bet you could make me cum just by sucking them, that's what it is."</p> <p>She smiled, and said, "That would be wonderful."</p> <p>She rolled off me, and I saw her reach for the blanket. I looked at her and saw that she had folded it and was tying it up herself. Then she slid onto the sand and lay on it while she kissed me. I put my arms around her and hugged her close. She broke the kiss. "Did that feel good, lover?"</p> <p>"Yes," I said softly.</p> <p>"Good," she said, and kissed me again. She slid off me, pulled the condom off and rolled it gently on, and then she leaned down and licked my cock and my balls. I couldn't believe the feelings she was leaving me when I came, and by the time she was done, I was already hard. She climbed back on top of me and I laid her down, then we lay together and watched the sunset come over the horizon. I put an arm around her, and she turned so that she could see me. Then we sat there and watched for a bit, and then I turned her over and got my mouth to her pussy. She started to moan when I sucked her clit, then I gently slid a finger in her ass. She began to rock on my finger, which caused me to work another finger in in her ass. It wasn't so bad for her now, but it made her orgasm last a long time. Maybe she should have done that some time, as she didn't seem as eager to have it done to herself as I did her. Still, I guess my love for her is strong.</p> <p>We sat there for a bit, and then I slid the condom off my dick, then sat up. She took my dick in her hand, and looked at it. She touched it, and then started to stroke it, then she kissed the head and kissed my ass. She kissed my cheeks, and then slid her mouth over my asshole. I felt her tongue slip in and lick me there. My ass was tingling. Finally, she slid back up my body, and kissed me.</p> <p>She said, "I want you to do something for me. I want to feel you inside me, but I don't think I can have a second erection without you. Let's go back to the tent." She stood up, took the condom off, lay down and held her legs apart. "Are you ready, lover?" she asked.</p> <p>"Yah."</p> <p>"Good. I want you in me, and then we can both feel you. Come on then, lover," she urged.</p> <p>I got the condoms, and we were back in the sleeping bag. We had no more towels, so we got naked again, and we lay and fondled and kissed as we fell asleep. I woke up at dawn, and we found ourselves spooning, and we fucked again in the morning.</p> <p>To be continued â€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
