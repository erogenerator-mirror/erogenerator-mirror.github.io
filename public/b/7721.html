"I've never had the guts to do anything."</p> <p>"And I know I haven't, but we should have a lot of sex."</p> <p>"We shouldn't," he said, "it's not what I do. It's...it's really what it is."</p> <p>"Oh, honey, aren't you worried about everything?" she said laughing, "I know. I've got this big house, and you won't feel like I can do what I want to do when I have to go to work. And besides, you might as well just go home and go to bed with one of those stupid nightmares that you have to get rid of. There's nothing wrong with being happy and making plans, but sex isn't something to do with good love or affection."</p> <p>He thought about that, "Well, OK," he said.</p> <p>She laughed again, "So, you're afraid that if there weren't going to be a lot of sex, what would you expect to do?"</p> <p>He shrugged, turning his head to stare off into the darkness of the trees.</p> <p>"It was a beautiful summer day when I was in my window bathing in the bathtub, looking up at the stars and remembering that day when all I had was a glass of wine and a nice warm tub."</p> <p>She stood up, pulling him into the trees to give him a kiss, "I really meant what I said, dear, but you don't feel so good. You've got a terrible hangover."</p> <p>"Well, maybe it's a little better," he said, rubbing his hand through his black hair.</p> <p>"You know what?" she said, looking into his brown eyes. "You're too good for me."</p> <p>He looked at her, and then his eyes dropped down to her cleavage, and a low moan came from her lips as he looked. He leaned in and kissed her, and she stood up, pulling him in for another kiss, and they were lost in each others arms until the moon was shining against their faces.</p> <p>She pushed him away. "Not yet!" she said, pulling him close to kiss him and then sitting down and taking a glass of wine out of her handbag.</p> <p>When they'd finished the glass, she kissed him again as he stood up and removed his jacket, setting it on the bench. Her kiss was even more passionate as she began undoing his shirt buttons, moving gently until her lips were at the point of his neck, moving from one collar to the next, licking ever so slowly. He lay her back on the bench gently and pushed her skirt up, watching her reaction as he took off his own skirt and removed his underwear, then pushed her legs apart and moved between her thighs.</p> <p>His mouth descended onto her again, his tongue lapping around her folds, and he kissed as much of her sweet taste as he could before lowering his head and plunging his tongue inside her, burying it deep inside. He kept moving until she began to buck her hips and he felt her juices flowing in his mouth, running down his chin and onto the bench. He lifted his mouth off her for a second to kiss her again, and she pulled him upwards, placing her mouth to his and thrusting her tongue into his mouth, her moans growing louder and louder until they were lost in the night, only they knew where they were going.</p> <p>He lowered his body onto hers, pinning her thighs to his, and kissed as deep as he could, moving his mouth up to her ear, sucking on the small spot between her ear and the base of her neck before kissing her lips and neck. He held himself against her, and began to slide himself up and down her, wanting to do it slowly and gently, but knowing that he couldn't give it what she was asking for.</p> <p>"I want you inside me," she whispered.</p> <p>"I think you're on the pill."</p> <p>She giggled, "Maybe some day. I don't want to have to deal with any disease."</p> <p>"Me neither. It feels like we've been having foreplay all our lives before I get you inside me."</p> <p>"And what I get is just foreplay," they both said at the same time.</p> <p>"And, do you have a condom?"</p> <p>"Not with the possibility of getting pregnant and all," she said, as she took the condom from his hands and put it in her bag, not bothering to put it on her own skirt.</p> <p>"How about I use a condom?" she asked, pulling her legs down and pulling her skirt upâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
