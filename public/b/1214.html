I asked.</p> <p>"We could," Rebecca said. "He's got a dick."</p> <p>Amy smiled.</p> <p>"It does," Rebecca said with a smile. "I'll put it here too!"</p> <p>Jill and Amy looked at each other nervously. Both could feel the beginnings of arousal in their bodies already, and both knew what to expect.</p> <p>The first thing they did was take off all their dresses, revealing their nakedness. Their excitement only made the second, more revealing show even more alluring. They put their dresses back on. Amy picked their bras, and Jill chose hers. My wife, however, had decided to wear her underwear, which I knew was the way to go. In fact, it gave her the option of taking her white panties off if she preferred.</p> <p>"Wow!" Rebecca exclaimed at her choice. "You looked amazing!"</p> <p>"You really liked that, too!" Amy said. Her face flushed, too.</p> <p>I could tell she liked the idea of being in public, being humiliated, even knowing it may lead to her being sexually humiliated, but also, I don't think, turn her on.</p> <p>"I think you'll like it too," I commented.</p> <p>Both were so turned on right now. Their faces glowed up and down with excitement. They both knew that I knew they were both turned on, but weren't sure how to make it happen.</p> <p>With our underwear under their bras and off, we just stood there in silence.</p> <p>Amy started looking for Rebecca's underwear on the floor, looking for it with a worried look.</p> <p>"Don't worry, honey. I picked them up," she said, looking for something from under her skirt.</p> <p>We both looked at Rebecca's panties and saw there was a damp wet spot. They were soaked, too, I thought to myself when I looked at them.</p> <p>"She's so wet!" I said to Jill, who had a look of surprise that I don't think Jill even felt. Rebecca looked down to where my underwear was and saw our mixed sex fluids. She got up and looked.</p> <p>"I wonder if you two can get a taste of each other right now?" I suggested.</p> <p>"Oh my, oh my, honey," Rebecca said as her face turned from surprise to desire. "Do you two want something?"</p> <p>I wanted to do it, but realized there might be other women here I might want to do that at the same time.</p> <p>I didn't want to break their moment of ecstasy, either.</p> <p>"I don't know, maybe," Rebecca said, turning to where I was standing. "I'll show you," she said, turning and looking again at my underwear.</p> <p>I had a problem with this. I was already aroused but the thought of another woman doing me and being touched right then was enough to distract me from my arousal. Maybe it was just my excitement. A moment later my mind made a decision.</p> <p>"Come here," I said, taking them both by the arms. I led them to a couch nearby.</p> <p>Their legs felt weak, and they wanted all of us to lie on the couch. They took our sides, like we did for them earlier, and looked at me again.</p> <p>I pulled Rebecca to me and slid her back down onto the couch beside me.</p> <p>"I think it's time for you to get down and dirty," I said. "You can go get your underwear off!"</p> <p>"Okay..." Rebecca said softly, as though I had a plan to break it off.</p> <p>She did as she was told, and before long we were both naked. I laid Rebecca on her back, facing the other side of the couch, facing the other wall, opposite the television. Rebecca's legs swung up to her chest as we laid her down, and her head was propped up on a pillow. Her head was facing me, and I was lying on top of her.</p> <p>"What are you two waiting for?" I said to the two women, one lying there and one lying there. I saw sweat forming on Rebecca's forehead, and it looked like she was trying to rub it with her hands.</p> <p>"Jill," Rebecca said as she finally turned her attention on me and the two of us. "Please, go over and take off every stitch of my underwear," she said softly, as though she was trying to coax her husband to do what she wanted.</p> <p>I heard more footsteps around them, so both got up and headed over to the couch. While I laid Rebecca down on her back, I looked her over first.
