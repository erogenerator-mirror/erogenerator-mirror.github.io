You know you're doing really good right here."</p> <p>"I...I'm...I'll never do that again," her breathing quickening.</p> <p>"I'm glad. I can see you like this a lot. Keep going." He reached out to stroke the underside of her cheek, pulling the hair away from her face so he could see.</p> <p>"No, I... I'm... I'm going....ahhhh!" she blurted out the word as it escaped from her clenched lips. Her body went from tensed and unshaved, down to tangle her ankles in his powerful arms, and her breathing came in pants and gasps. Her whole body quaked, her skin glowed pink and glowing as it became more and more sensitive and alive. He held her for a moment, letting her catch her breath, then he lifted her up, then lay her back down again on the bed.</p> <p>"Stay," he said, then slowly moved her body up the length until he was lying between her legs. Her eyes closed with pleasure. Then her lips parted slightly as he pushed his lips, running his tongue over her sensitive clit.</p> <p>"Ohh! Oh... my....Ohh!" she moaned, her body tightening. "That's so much better!"</p> <p>"It can be, too," he answered. He lifted her ass from the bed and slid his erection into her. She let a small whimper as he drove home, then she reached up to grip his head, pulling him in for another kiss.</p> <p>"More?" he asked.</p> <p>"Yes," she answered, reaching back and taking his hand to stroke hers.</p> <p>"Good." His hips moved forward with a little thrust, slowly pulling back and getting a little harder each time. Her fingers dug into his back as his thrusts got stronger and deeper, her eyes shuttered and her face grimaced with pleasure as she came, but it was all she said as another huge wave of pleasure rolled through her, her pussy tightening around his cock. She was panting on top of him, her hips writhing against his. He felt that last wave of orgasm wash over and over and he thrust into her one last time, spilling his seed deep into her.</p> <p>His body was still, his hips still moving within her, until she pushed him off, pulling him even tighter against her as she lay her head on the pillow.</p> <p>"I've missed you so much!" she finally squeaked.</p> <p>"I missed you too, love."</p> <p>"That I have!" she said. He held her close to him and stroked her hair. She was quiet for a half-minute.</p> <p>"Would you stay the next three days?" he asked, his voice even as it dropped into the pit of her stomach.</p> <p>"I could go again," she said.</p> <p>"Well, you do have to be on your back on a bed."</p> <p>"I'm on my back," she said, looking down at him. He put a finger to his lips.</p> <p>"Not quite so quickly. Go lay on your back."</p> <p>"I'm going to let you rest until I get you back so you're still as strong as ever," she said, rolling over and looking at him. "You know, I know I'm going to have a hard time keeping you from seeing your father and thinking about me naked, so you have to be strong too."</p> <p>"Yeah. But I still can't get used to hearing you like that," he said. "You're just so sexy."</p> <p>"You're no different. I'm still going to be as beautiful as I was last night."</p> <p>"Me tooâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
