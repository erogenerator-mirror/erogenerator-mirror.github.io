'Is she?'</p> <p>'I don't want her to see me,' I replied.</p> <p>He looked at me for a minute and then said. 'I think I can help.'</p> <p>I was silent for a long while before I spoke. 'I should get back in the saddle and get on with my job,' I said. 'It's a long ride and a bad one,' I said with resignation.</p> <p>'Don't you want to feel good with me?' He said hopefully. 'If I let you ride, will you?'</p> <p>I thought about my answer for a long minute. 'I guess I will,' I said. 'Now let's get back.'</p> <p>As soon as we got back on the road, our conversation became more serious. ‘Well,' David said, ‘how about you? And you know, I haven't paid any fines in weeks. I might need a few bucks to pay for a job well done.'</p> <p>I gave him an encouraging smile with a hint of fear that this wasn't going to be a good thing. He reached back into his pocket for the money to cover his mistake. Once it was there he handed it to me and asked, ‘have I got you a credit card?'</p> <p>'It's not for loan sharks,' I replied.</p> <p>'They can make a lot of money if they can make their share on the same loan,' he suggested.</p> <p>'But I'll make even more cash,' I offered.</p> <p>'We can work something out,' David suggested. 'A good night out will do you good.'</p> <p>When I was out the back of the shop I had a sense that David wasn't about to spend all his money. In fact, he wasn't as much about to work as he appeared to be.</p> <p>We drove on to the nearest town, which was only about a quarter mile away. David had chosen a very small town called Charing Cross. It was on a rural road at one of the few available sides of the city.</p> <p>We walked around it for some time, discussing how I paid up my debt from the previous evening's dance. I told him about why I had started working with David. He asked when I would be able to begin paying my debt from the dance after the end of winter. I told him it would not be until the next week.</p> <p>'I'll go up for months,' he said. ‘If you want to talk about it some other time. It will solve all his money problems for sure.'</p> <p>'Why so early?'</p> <p>'I don't think that's wise,' he said. 'What you're doing is for charity, and that makes you more of a prostitute.'</p> <p>'What do you mean?'</p> <p>'Well, in this country, the women are supposed to go to bars and see women flaunting their bodies in the streets, but I've never done that myself and it has never appealed to me. You're a good teacher, and I don't like the idea of you paying me to dance.'</p> <p>'What do you mean?'</p> <p>'You're teaching me, and I think you're doing a good job for it. If I were you, you could have the same effect on me,' he said seriously.</p> <p>'I don't think that's going to be necessary,' I said. ‘It's not at this point I want to talk about whether I want to do it. You'll have to tell me what it is you want to do as a teacher.'</p> <p>He was looking at me steadily for a minute or so before he replied. 'Well I suppose that's quite the trick, isn't it?' He grinned. 'You're on. You look amazing in that dress. I've never done anything like it before. I'm sure I could teach you a lot by now. But tell me if I'm wrong. Maybe I won't be.'</p> <p>'Alright, but I think I'm going to be a little late tonight,' I replied nervously.</p> <p>We got to his place, which was at the end of a long road that turned in to a small country town. We followed a small, stone road until we stopped at a front door. One of the gates had a bell that had been installed there and a long chain dangling down from the end. David opened the door and said, ‘Come in,' he said looking for something to say.</p> <p>Inside was a large, old, double bed with soft fabric draped around the footstool above. There was an old-fashioned kettle on the counter and coffee pot next to it. On one side of the room was a large cabinet, with a few drawers that seemed to have disappeared—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
