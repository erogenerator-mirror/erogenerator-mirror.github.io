Don't worry, I won't keep her waiting. She wants you badly."</p> <p>I didn't hesitate for another few minutes, kissing and caressing the other women's body as I drove us home. There was no way I was going to let her out of my arms right then, but it was something I couldn't wait to try. I'm sure my cock would have been hard for me to drive home with one hand, but she was not a very attractive woman.</p> <p>*</p> <p>I am glad that my new wife is a very sweetheart. That was our first real weekend together. It was all she could do to keep from coming home at night, even if we were together 24/7. She really is a good looking woman, and we were able to spend a lot of time together. We talked of nothing, and I enjoyed her company even more than I normally do.</p> <p>She was fun to be with, and she made me think of every woman I had ever known. We talked about her college, and what she did. Her family had moved away when she was in college, and I had a very good job and had not had too much to do with it all.</p> <p>I felt like we'd been best friends for years, and that we'd be better than that. My last two years had flown by as a result of our work and we hadn't had much chance to really become anything close. It did make me wonder if her parents had been really surprised when she left home with me. Not that I ever would have thought that she would have changed her mind, either.</p> <p>There were a few things that I liked about her. Things like I could really call her by her given name, and I wouldn't need to know who she was when we talked. She seemed almost sweet, and just the opposite of my wife, who was an absolute knockout. I knew it was all because she was young, and it was obvious that she was in good shape. Her figure is not in the shape that men are when they look at her, but there is something about the way she moves, and her hair flows past her ears in a way that I could say no to.</p> <p>When we were about 15 minutes from the cabin, the phone rang.</p> <p>It was her parents. They had an event planned they came over and said they were looking forward to coming over that week, so they were on their way to visit.</p> <p>I started feeling nervous. I couldn't begin to think about what might happen next with her parents having sex, or her being alone while we were alone, for the rest of the weekend. She could still be doing a lot of other things with that man. Maybe.</p> <p>I tried to tell myself that our weekend wasn't about sex for her, but I still had a hard part. I had an attraction to another man, but it felt like I could never see her having a guy.</p> <p>She had to be at home. Maybe she might even take care of herself and have some fun, or she was so young.</p> <p>But it wasn't for her, she seemed to be more interested in a man's hands than in her own. I knew that, even if it was a nice feeling. I could just imagine her hand in his, and that she could make it cum in a hurry, or even more...</p> <p>That last thought made me start to feel warm around the base of my cock. It had been hard and hard for a while, but I felt that if we had any plans to play this out this weekend, we might as well do it right.</p> <p>I made the decision the next day that I wasn't going to come home until Monday, which was only a couple hours away, while she was having a party of some sort with another man. On my decision to come to the party, I also had to make a decision I didn't want to make right away.</p> <p>My decision was to go to work early and be home by 6:00 am, after our first day of "dates." I started the day off by taking a shower and packing up my clothes, deciding to grab a late dinner just then. I didn't feel much like cooking anything, and I figured it would be interesting to eat something to go with the meal.</p> <p>A little later than I was ready to start the evening, I heard the sound of a woman's voice, which made me jump. When my mind realized that the voice belonged to one of my neighbors, I was shocked to the world.</p> <p>"Hi. The man on the phone said that I can see your feet, that someone might like to go on a foot manger for you. He said that you can look at them while you're up here for dinner. I don't know why, but it's not for me to talk to you for a while because you can't talk about your neighborsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
