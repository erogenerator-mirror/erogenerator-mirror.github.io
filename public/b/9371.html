I pushed them against his hand and felt my nipples rubbing against his fingers. His fingers pressed harder against my nipples, feeling as much flesh in his fingers as he did in my breasts. He knew I liked it when his fingers were so close to my breasts. God, I was getting so hot for him. It felt so good, it felt so right!</p> <p>“God, that feels so good, “ I said breathlessly.</p> <p>His fingers started to move gently over my breasts, making sure they moved in the correct shape without going too far down inside them. He was right, no mistake. His tongue touched my right breast, then the left. My body shuddered when the sensation that went through my body and made my nipples tingle were right on my sensitive nipples. His fingers stroked over them as if it were a penis. My body began to shake and I could barely hold on to the coffee table for support. I moaned softly.</p> <p>“Let me do the same for you. Let me have some more fun with you,” he said in his sexy manner.</p> <p>With the first touch of his mouth on my nipple, my body went into spasms and my knees went almost to my ears. I couldn’t hold on.</p> <p>“Oh, fuck!” I wailed. I looked down to see his long, slender fingers, still stroking over my breasts, playing with them, and teasing my nipples as I writhed with my body, squirming, and trying to push myself into him. The feeling of his hands on my breasts and his mouth on my nipples excited me beyond anything I had ever felt before. I was on the brink of exploding, I was so hot!</p> <p>He laughed softly from between my breasts.</p> <p>“That’s it, baby. You’re so pretty. You’ll want to cum, won’t you?” He crooned. “Cum for daddy!” He whispered, and it seemed like magic as my body convulsed and my juices flowed like Niagara Falls.</p> <p>He took some of my juices in his mouth, licking it all off his hand. It seemed like he enjoyed the taste. I could feel my body go limp, so he put his mouth back on my breasts. His mouth left my breasts, and he looked up at me with his eyes. His hand slowly lifted itself away from my breasts, which he gently squeezed, then he moved it down to my tummy. He stroked over it, over my pubic hair, and back to my navel. He looked at me for a long time before he smiled at me.</p> <p>I smiled back at him. He bent over to kiss me and gently bit my lower lip, sucking on it. I wanted to taste myself there, but didn’t. I couldn’t do it without losing control. My body felt so good. This man’s hands seemed to know how to feel me. It felt like he might know exactly where to touch me.</p> <p>“Let me touch you more.” I managed to say between kisses.</p> <p>He lifted his head and smiled.</p> <p>“Yes. I could do with some relief. I’m sure you could too.”</p> <p>“I’d like a little relief yourself.” I said with a wink.</p> <p>“Not until I’m done with your breasts.”</p> <p>His mouth dropped back down to mine again, and I melted into him. I felt no resistance in him or any other body movement. His hands were just roaming over my thighs and back, then he cupped my ass in his hands. I knew what his dick felt like, but I couldn’t see him. His hand stayed at the base of my spine while he kissed me. His fingers were just at the center of my belly, but I was aware that he moved lower and then up as if he were on his knees. I was sure he wanted to look at my ass, or feel it, but I didn’t have very long to wonder because his hand had found it. I felt a little tremble in my body at the sight of his fingers making it's way further up and lower along my skin. His fingers moved back up to my belly as if they were playing a trick on me. I thought I might faint. He continued to trail those fingers back up my body. I could feel them moving as he moved them over me, over my breasts, then down across my hips. Then his fingers—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
