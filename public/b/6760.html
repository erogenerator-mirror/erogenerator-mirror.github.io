Maybe she did sense her reaction to him. Maybe it wasn't that obvious but she was getting off on it more than once and she wanted more. Perhaps he was being unreasonable? Perhaps she wanted a bit more?</p> <p>She didn't answer as he sat down on the edge of the bed. His arms folded under his chin and he said,</p> <p>"I think that our relationship is over, now is the time."</p> <p>"What? The time that you know so well?" she asked, turning to him and her shoulders slumped a bit.</p> <p>"Oh, no..." he said and reached out his arms for her but she said no, rather she didn't touch him. She moved closer to him and turned to whisper in his ear.</p> <p>"We have just met," she said breathlessly as she leaned in and kissed his neck. She licked his skin.</p> <p>She didn't know what to do. She couldn't get a hold of himself. She couldn't be rude; she had to be soft. She was still angry at herself for leaving him like that. She knew now that she could make him feel better but then she had gone after him.</p> <p>"I don't know..." she said as if to explain herself. "I don't know. I'm sorry."</p> <p>"It's just that..." his voice began as if it were going to come out in a string. "I don't know how to stop it. It's just that..." He started again but she moved her head away from his and turned her face toward his. She kissed him again and again. This time it wasn't a long lingering kiss between lovers but one that had an urgency and urgency in it and it started inside her.</p> <p>"Please," she said as she started for the door.</p> <p>"Please... let me help you," she said in a desperate breath.</p> <p>"I think we better go and we may find something to do here." He said.</p> <p>He knew that she felt awkward and he could smell her on the way. He didn't give her any time to think. He walked to the door and opened it a little as if to let her know that he was there.</p> <p>She couldn't move without turning her head. She turned away and he went to follow.</p> <p>She opened the door quietly and watched as Mr Carter walked through with the door open.</p> <p>He walked in a little past her in the direction that he had been led. He looked down at her, smiled and said,</p> <p>"I didn't say that I would find anything appropriate to wear for a party. I just said that I would like to watch."</p> <p>She looked up at him hopefully. He gave her a puzzled look and replied,</p> <p>"Not really, not exactly. I'm taking you out for a drink or two. The place is closed and it's been a while."</p> <p>He walked over toward her and sat down in the same seat. She went to sit next to him. He got up and sat back on the other side of her.</p> <p>"So," he said. "You do like dressing like a slut," he said and patted the seat behind him.</p> <p>"I know," she said simply. "I know. But, yeah, I do."</p> <p>"You do?" he questioned, his eyes boring into her. "Why? Why are you doing this?" he asked.</p> <p>"I love dressing like a slut," she replied softly but with a slight smile to make sure that she didn't have to explain herself too.</p> <p>He turned to face her. "You don't have to do this," he said in a low almost pleading voice. "My place is at least twenty four. I'm probably twenty five." He paused and then asked,</p> <p>"But, but I'm a man. Men are all about their clothes. We all work and a girl can go anywhere and dress like a man."</p> <p>"I don't know," she said.</p> <p>"But you can't dress like a man." The tone in his voice said that he didn't really believe that and frankly she didn't know whether to believe it or not. "But, but..." his voice trailed off.</p> <p>She turned and looked out the window as if expecting her head being lifted by a stranger. No one turned to look at her and she turned and looked at what she thought were the nearest windows.</p> <p>"I love you," she said, her voice a little hoarse.</p> <p>He leaned over to her and said, "Don't be a stranger in the world of men. This is your chance to get away from you because you can't get away from yourself."</p> <p>"I guess there'sâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
