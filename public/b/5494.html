He was quick to oblige, but she was a little hesitant. She didn't think it would be wise to test him.</p> <p>He kissed her again and then he did it again, all over her face. She started pulling at his pants but he gently pushed back to pull his trousers back up. She pushed her body hard into his and kissed him again. That was all he wanted.</p> <p>"Why don't you get these things off and sit on the edge of the bed," he said as he began removing his clothes.</p> <p>It didn't take long. He was already semi hard and she was on the verge of taking him inside her with his large cock but couldn't bring herself to do it. She sat on the edge of the bed and lifted her legs in his large strong arms, he pulled them back around over his shoulders. She wrapped her arms about his neck.</p> <p>"Please don't hurt me," she begged.</p> <p>John didn't hesitate for long. He pulled her feet back against her and pushed down on her pelvis. His cock was aimed at her crotch and it glided inside her. The pleasure was intense as it entered her. Her arms were still around his neck and his mouth locked on hers. He continued thrusting his hips up into her with each stroke. She reached down to feel him inside her. With his fingers on the small of her back she began to massage it. She was already very aroused.</p> <p>John slid his arm from her back and placed it on her stomach. He began to pull on her hips, he knew she liked that. She squeezed him around her body as he slid in and out of her.</p> <p>He put his hands on top of the top of her buttocks and pulled her to him. His cock was fully erect inside her and she felt every ridge and vein on it. Her eyes closed as she felt her vagina enveloped by his huge cock.</p> <p>John stopped to allow her to breathe. She opened her eyes again and saw a look in his eyes. It was an expression that made her feel better than what she was used to. "Come on, let's finish what we started," he said as he pulled her feet off his shoulders and turned her towards the head of the bed. She was on the edge of it, but he was not close to entering her. When he was just near the edge he stopped and said, "Hmmm, is that going to work?"</p> <p>"Umm, I guess... It was a surprise!"</p> <p>"Oh yes, I think you'll like it, because that's what I'll do for you," he said as he pushed her legs open and slid his cock inside her once again.</p> <p>She groaned softly and wrapped her thighs around the sides of his body. He looked down at her breasts with his hands on them. Her nipples were big and he could see the small bumps of her areolae. She was very aroused again but she was not going to let him have all of her.</p> <p>"Is this good? Will you let me... feel you there?" he asked as he pulled his cock out then pushed it back in fast.</p> <p>"Mmmm, yes," she moaned as his thrusts were hitting the spot.</p> <p>He pulled out his hand and reached up for her breast, she quickly opened her eyes and gave him a look of confusion. He was only concerned about what she would be willing to do. She was already on the edge of the bed so he pushed his legs over it. He pushed himself up on his knees and kept his cock inside her. He pulled out. It slid easily out of her. He leaned down and kissed her deeply. She didn't know what was missing but she wanted this feeling of his cum inside her.</p> <p>"Let's change positions," he said as he picked her up and laid her down on the bed. The sheets were covered with a thin cloth. He put her back down on the bed and knelt over her. He opened her legs then slid them slowly open. He got down on his knees and began to lick her pussy. She was soaking wet. Her pussy was already flowing and he took his time cleaning her. She wasn't the object, but his hands stayed where he was.</p> <p>He didn't need any suggestions. His tongue slid up and down in her juices and his fingers pulled on her hard nipples. She pushed her pelvis into his face. He wasn't sure, but he could tell she was getting close. He moved his face further down and found her clitoris. He was surprised to taste something different.
