I mean, she's beautiful, but... I don't know..."</p> <p>"I think you're beautiful, you know," I sighed. "No, I mean, it's not just you that I think about; you're hot. It's just that you're a woman, for God's sake!"</p> <p>"Yeah, I can see that -- well, you know I just... I couldn't resist. I didn't even have time to think about it. All my time away from her," she said, giving my arm a rub.</p> <p>"Yeah -- and your sister -- too?" I asked.</p> <p>"Yeah, that's why I've been doing it with her. I just felt weird about it, you know?"</p> <p>"Yeah, I'm sure it's okay. I guess you're doing the right thing with your body too," I replied, trying to convince myself.</p> <p>"Maybe my body is wrong, but I know it's what you're doing is what I want. I'm in control. Just don't stop touching me all over -- I mean, look at me..."</p> <p>"Yeah, I know. No, keep talking. Go with it... don't let go of me."</p> <p>Karen seemed a little shocked and I felt bad before I made a couple of promises. I knew I would have to tell her about this, and the way I felt, I couldn't let her know how much I'd hoped it would happen. At least, that was what I told myself. But I knew it was wrong; I couldn't even say it out loud, could I?</p> <p>"Sure you can -- I mean, I'm a guy!" I snapped. "But why don't we go to the bedroom and... you know, um..."</p> <p>"Oh? Why do you think that's a good idea? You're already in the bedroom and you'll be alone," she exclaimed. "If we keep going, your sister will probably be asleep by the time you get there."</p> <p>"I'm sorry! I'll just go. I won't try to explain to anyone what we are doing," I said, shaking my head. "It won't hurt anything."</p> <p>With that, I got up and we set off towards her bedroom. I got the biggest shock of my life when I got there, and the sight of my sister in her bedroom didn't disgust me. She was dressed quite casually, but she was as sexy as hell! She looked good enough to fuck! I saw it as our two favorite things: I could tell she had been in her room for most of the week looking at her pictures, watching her friends play tennis, reading the 'net, and watching her friends with a boyfriend she'd just met. And to top it all off, she had already said yes to my asking, and I was happy to see she was pleased.</p> <p>After she finished putting on the outfit, I started by taking her out by the pool, making her swim underwater and then swim some laps around me, watching her play a few pool games. I wanted those pictures to be mine, but I knew we would end up with some embarrassing photos, like the one she took of me in a skimpy bikini at the beach. And just to be even more embarrassing, I was going to send that picture to her sister if we didn't want to ruin our friendship and everything, if that was what she was looking at. I decided against it; I even thought about making those naughty pictures of myself in a bikini, but then I realized she might think I was sexy. And if she didn't see the pictures, I might lose my friendship forever by telling her to get lost.</p> <p>"What are you doing?" she asked as she finished undressing to get started swimming laps.</p> <p>"Sorry, I think I've already made up my mind," I said sheepishly. "Let's just start making out in the pool, it doesn't really have much to do."</p> <p>She laughed -- she always did laugh -- and we went down to the stairs to join her brother in the pool. His eyes were still shut, but he was starting to take more interest in the sight of Karen than in the sight of me. We both walked toward each other, still in our swimwear, but I noticed he was staring -- I noticed there was a bulge in his shorts. We both laughed and started swimming towards each other, but just as I got there, he stopped and said something that made me laugh even more.</p> <p>"Hey -- what? Were you just checking me out?"</p> <p>"I see -- I was just," I said, and he just smiled and shook his head. He had no idea how much it had hurt me by not seeing the picture before. I looked over at him and saw the hurt in his eyes.</p> <p>"Honey, how didâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
