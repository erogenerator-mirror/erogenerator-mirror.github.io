"Can I ask you something? How did your new roommate feel about you yesterday?"</p> <p>"I have to admit the same. It was fun. I did it in my mind to get him to do it again."</p> <p>She smiled. "It was kind of hard to get the same reaction when I did it the first time I did it the first time. He really got turned-on by fucking you."</p> <p>"I'm sure he was turned-on too. And it gave me really warm feelings."</p> <p>"Well, I'm sure it was fun. Maybe you should ask for something I've never done before."</p> <p>"Well, actually this is pretty good. But you're not going to be able to do me that way, are you?"</p> <p>"Oh, I'm sure I could."</p> <p>"Good, because I want you, but I'll never fuck you that way without some preparation."</p> <p>She giggled. "If you want to try, that's cool."</p> <p>"And don't worry, it won't be the same."</p> <p>"I know. I'm just a little apprehensive."</p> <p>"I understand. You know me so well. You're a good looking guy too, and I've wanted to fuck you for ever. I'd do it. All I have to do is ask."</p> <p>"I hope so."</p> <p>"I guess just do. It's no big deal. That's my fantasy, anyway."</p> <p>"I know."</p> <p>"Well, I hope you're not offended," I teased, pulling her to me with a smile.</p> <p>"No, not at all. It's just a little awkward, if you don't know what that is."</p> <p>"Are you sure?" This was a new line she'd used. My imagination was going wild.</p> <p>"Yep, I'm sure."</p> <p>She pulled me up so that my chest was nestled against her breasts, which were much larger than I'd hoped for. My cock had already been hard, and I was glad that it didn't show. I ran my hands down to her hips, feeling the softness of her ass cheeks.</p> <p>We stood there for a minute, as if just making out. She reached down and grasped my engorged member at the base. With one hand, she ran the head through the hair at the base of my cock, which made my cock jump. She ran her fingers all along its length. With the other hand, both hands, she ran up and down the shaft, squeezing it firmly as though testing its weight and stiffness. When she reached it, she put the head all the way in her mouth, sucking hard.</p> <p>"Oh, Jesus, Mom!" I exclaimed. Her mouth felt so good. "I have never ...ever had this before."</p> <p>It was difficult for me to articulate how I'd wanted to do it. She was giving me a blowjob. But it felt so good just the way it was. I reached down and put my hands on her waist. I pulled her against me. I could feel my heart beating rapidly within the confines of my chest. I felt her breasts mashed against my chest. She sucked, her tongue swirling on the head of my cock as it passed through her lips again and again. When the pressure grew to my stomach, I started to withdraw. As I withdrew, the tip of my cock would brush against her clitoris, which was already there and poking out from beneath its protective hood. I could feel the wet warmth of her vagina, the outer lips that surrounded it as they opened up to greet my shaft.</p> <p>She was already moist and warm in spite of the lack of the previous coating of blood. I knew I'd have to take this slowly, but I was so turned on by it.</p> <p>"Are you ready?" I asked, breathing very deeply.</p> <p>"Yes. Take me."</p> <p>"Take me what?"</p> <p>"Take my cock!"</p> <p>"You've got a really big one. What will it feel like in you?"</p> <p>"It doesn't feel that big in the past. Are you sure you want to stick that big thing in me?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Then you had better start fucking me, as soon as you have it inside you." Her hand started to work my cock in and out, pushing it deep into her vagina. "I want you inside me, now. Make me come."</p> <p>"God, yes!"</p> <p>We both started moving in unison. I moved her hips against mine, forcing them both to thrust back and forth with a strength I didn't think I could hold back. She was so tight. And it felt so good.
