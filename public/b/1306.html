She had her knees together, and she was staring back at me over her glasses that was covering her black laces. She was breathing deep with her eyes closed, but her face only held light brown.</p> <p>I felt a sudden rush of excitement as my girlfriend came up to me and wrapped her arms around my neck, pulling me closer and pressing her lips hard against mine.</p> <p>I felt dizzy and weak, I tried to pull away, but she grabbed my hands and pulled them down her back. I felt her hot lips press into mine as I felt the softness of her face between my own.</p> <p>We broke apart a minute later to catch our breath.</p> <p>"Do you need some relief?" she asked sweetly.</p> <p>"Not with you," I replied. "What'd you think?"</p> <p>"I can't believe you've ever been with a girl, you never said anything like that! Did you know?" she asked.</p> <p>"What? No, but I've been with other girls before, you've never told me anything you're attracted to." There I was trying to get her to say something clever, when I felt a hand stroking my face. I opened one eye and saw her gazing at me. Her bright brown eyes were sparkling, sparkling like an emerald. She looked as if she was searching my eyes for a clue.</p> <p>I felt a little guilty and awkward, and I guess the alcohol had loosened my tongue, because suddenly my girlfriend had wrapped her arms tighter around me and sat down on the bed with me.</p> <p>"What was that all about?" she asked, pulling away from me and looked up at me.</p> <p>"I can't stop staring at you," I said. "You're so beautiful I've been staring at you all day."</p> <p>She ran her hand down my cheek and kissed it, then pulled her lips away.</p> <p>"That's not true," she said. "It was because you look so much like me that I've been avoiding telling you about girls, or the lack of them. But I've wanted to do it, for so long."</p> <p>"Have you been looking at me?" I asked hopefully.</p> <p>"Is that a come on?" she asked. "After all, how many girls are you going to get on our 'sex test'?"</p> <p>"I've been thinking about getting on your test all day," I said. "All I want to do is kiss you. Can we?"</p> <p>"Of course we can," she said. "You were just trying to get me back to normal again."</p> <p>"Don't worry sweetheart," I said. "I'll never cheat on Karen, let's just do it again."</p> <p>"Okay," she said, and suddenly she sat up and started unbuttoning my shirt, which fell off the rest of the way as she lifted my arms and took my sweat bottoms off. As she did so, I noticed that her beautiful eyes were sparkling like those of a sparkling cat, and her smile was radiant. Then she stood up and looked at me.</p> <p>"Can I take these off?" she asked.</p> <p>"No," I replied. "I want to feel you touch me again."</p> <p>There was a brief pause, which seems like half an eternity, as she looked around the room before she slowly slid her hands up my sides.</p> <p>"This is something we've only done, a lot," she said as she undid my shirt and threw it to the side, then she put her arms around me and kissed me. This was definitely the most romantic kiss I had ever gotten from a girl I didn't even know.</p> <p>I felt the warmth of her breath against my neck as she moved her face closer to me and kissed my ear and then my chest.</p> <p>"Mmmmm," she heard me say in a whisper. "This feels so good."</p> <p>She looked up at my face as we kissed, and looked into my eyes. I felt her lips press against my earlobe and then she slowly kissed my throat, then down my abdomen.</p> <p>"Karen's never done this with me, and I've never done this with anybody before either," she said as she kissed my abdomen.</p> <p>"You better not be." I said. "I'm going to get a good one of my own."</p> <p>We made eye contact, and there were no doubts. She took off my sweat shirt the rest of the way and threw it behind me and knelt down beside me, taking my cock in her mouth.</p> <p>When she put it in her mouth she just held it there for a moment, sucking lightly on it. Then she put my whole cock in her mouth.</p> <p>It felt likeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
