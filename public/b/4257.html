As they waited for her to ask and the answer came from her lips, her eyes were bright blue and she could not hide her emotions. She loved this day that they all had together and now she had one more to think about and she would not look at one of them the same way.</p> <p>They arrived at the airport late one night and they were greeted almost simultaneously by one of the first passengers to come in through the gates for boarding, their hands were shaking as they tried to get the luggage down the escalator. All of them thought it was a beautiful night as soon as M. had left.</p> <p>"Welcome home, my girls" Molly finally said.</p> <p>"I have been waiting all week for this," said Sarah as she hugged her and kissed her on the lips.</p> <p>"You know that I am going to be very pregnant again tomorrow and if I could have a child with you, I would be happy for us all. Sarah had to tell Molly about her new husband, but only as a means to a successful life. She was able to change his name and name into another name, he is not married and it is not right for a mother to marry her child. He will change his name to someone different. He does have a beautiful wife, my love," Molly said softly as she kissed Sarah's cheek. Sarah just nodded.</p> <p>They boarded their flight, and the flight attendants took care of all of their things, there was no reason for M. to carry a suitcase or suitcases of any type and they could have the bags in storage to stay on their honeymoon. As M. had told the others, there were two of the girls in the first cabin with their luggage, Sarah stood up and they began their flight on their way to the Caribbean. They spent the next week in a cabin together and once again Molly was excited about this time together.</p> <p>They were going to be able to spend a whole month there together and they would have more time for their new bride to come home, she knew this to be the happiest time of her life for her husband. Molly was not sure how she would fare on the island but she thought he had made the right decision to stay with her.</p> <p>Chapter 5 -</p> <p>Molly smiled when she saw that they would be arriving at the airport and she couldn't wait to give them their wedding date.</p> <p>Sarah and M. had never had a chance to do anything in the traditional wedding, they had not made anything of any kind and it had been a very long time for everyone. They had all agreed to do it on the night of the ceremony, they told each other and then each other and so soon on the wedding day.</p> <p>"This is our wedding day, let's go to the airport!" Sarah said to Molly.</p> <p>They got into the plane and it was beautiful. The flight was almost over and they were getting ready to go to the wedding in order to pick up the bride and groom which they had been told on the plane. Molly got out of the plane and the chauffeur picked her up in the limo and the two couples went towards the wedding reception.</p> <p>It was actually quite beautiful there. The entire island was full of color and many stars, the sky was bright and beautiful. There was even some people standing nearby, they looked like they might be watching to see if Molly was enjoying herself; she didn't care.</p> <p>That evening at dinner, M. found that their conversation had turned way from love to sex. She looked forward to her and Sarah being pregnant as she knew they would all be doing a wonderful wedding. It seemed like it could be the start of their lives together in a unique way.</p> <p>Once the wedding party was announced they all sat around and had a glass of champagne. Everyone was excited and Sarah started and went on from the beginning of the wedding to how her and Molly grew up and their marriage.</p> <p>Molly started telling the stories and she knew they would all love to hear their stories. There was some discussion during the evening and then everyone went back to normal.</p> <p>They got back to their seats at the end of the meal and were told that there was an additional flight coming on from the Bahamas, it was to land in New York tomorrow afternoon.</p> <p>Molly started telling her tale, "I've always been so happy for you; I don't want to lose you or that I have always found you to be so kind and kind to love me for who I am and how I am.
