I just want to grab that mouth and stuff it with spunk."</p> <p>"No... I'm sorry, you don't get to fuck her. I just don't want you to cum down mine. That's all I want you to cum down..."</p> <p>"I'm sorry, you just don't get what I want. I've been thinking about trying you but I've never done it"</p> <p>"I want us to be a threesome, no one is going anywhere" and she reached for her phone and left me there playing with myself. I'm not sure how long I was like that but I got up and followed the girl who I've come to crave but had no way of satisfying with her body. We went out into the evening party. I saw most of the lights in the room on but there was also a big circle of people. After a couple of drinks the girl who the girl was with slid down a guy's leg and I was the only who didn't really feel her body... and as the lights came back on the scene was one of the loudest one yet. Someone was slapping at her head to move her face back again. The sight of her face and skin against a glass of beer did a number on me. The smell of it gave me a boner all evening but when she was done she looked at me and had this weird smile on her face..."What are you doing here"</p> <p>"I'm in the bathroom... what's going on" I stammered. The lights in the room were back on but I didn't notice anyone in the room. As I walked I thought about how beautiful she was and how I wanted to make her the woman she was. We sat around for a couple more minutes and then he took charge with some of those things.</p> <p>"I got you a drink" He said and took the beer from her hand "Why don't you get me another drink while I'm gone? It seems you've never been around women and you like how slutty you are don't you? Go and get me that beer". He walked away and I started to get up for my beer.</p> <p>When I got back he was gone and I heard footsteps coming back with another beer and another girl. He was sitting next to a girl I did not know, she was wearing a dress but that was about it.</p> <p>"Are you sure you're not a slut?" he asked.</p> <p>"Fuck her brains out" She had a look in her eyes, "That girl was just fucking horny". He gave the girl her drink. I noticed this girl was a bit shorter and had black hair like her.</p> <p>"Are you sure you're not a slut?"</p> <p>"I'm fine, I'm a slut. I just wanted to be sure that you didn't want me."</p> <p>"Do you regret that you came in my wife at this party. She looks really happy and she's a little drunk. Do you think she's out for the night?"</p> <p>I wanted to be the only one to find out what he thinks about that "I hate you I just want to find out" I told him I wasn't a slut. He said what was needed to know was that I would never tell anyone. I wanted to find out who he's thought so my wife would never know.</p> <p>"No, no I'm fine" I said, I really am just a fucking slut. Go get me that beer I'm not leaving until you find out for yourself. I watched her head to the kitchen and as we walked by she just looked at us. I took a couple of steps and turned around, "Are you sure you don't want me?" I knew I was in trouble.</p> <p>"No I'm fine." She replied.</p> <p>"Okay.... Well don't worry about your wife, I didn't do anything." He said in an almost pleading voice</p> <p>"Thank you, I didn't mean to..." I couldn't say that I didn't love him I really love him.</p> <p>"That's not true" he said. "She'll be upset if there is a little more of your cum in there, you didn't finish."</p> <p>"No, I'm fine if you are" I said trying to get me some attention.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, I really don't want to hurt you. Please leave your wife alone."</p> <p>"No, I'm not hurt by anything you do to me, I just..." I stopped myself.</p> <p>"I know you love your wife, I didn't mean for all this to happen. I love her and I love her but I just don't want to hurt her."</p> <p>I don't know why, you probably think he is going toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
