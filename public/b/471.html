"That was mean!" She declared, and we both laughed.</p> <p>The next night, at the hotel lounge, we took turns ordering drinks from the bar, and each ordered a pizza. We sipped our shots, and talked about old times, our lives, hobbies, and the future. We got to know each other even more, and the conversation flowed to a wonderful level. After a while, I asked her out. She said yes, I wanted to get a divorce in a few weeks, and would probably move back to my hometown to live with my parents.</p> <p>She asked her parents to send down some sort of divorce papers. They said they would go out of town to help her pack as much as possible. They would put her through University, complete her degree, and move to Los Angeles. They would pay her tuition for the whole school year, plus a lot more for the fall. It seemed her father would be there too. I think they were afraid that there would become a big problem, or that they would get hurt.</p> <p>She was excited; she was excited at the thought of living her life in Las Vegas, with me along with her parents, and not having all this money, which didn't make any sense, except that they wanted to show me where I could live, when I came home.</p> <p>I asked her, was I in trouble in L.A.?</p> <p>"Do me a favour, don't tell my parents; tell them how my mother and sister would love to come out to your folks if they were here and come visit you. They'll get over it and move back to their families after they're done with you, and then maybe they'll come to visit you someday.</p> <p>"I was hoping that her parents didn't know I was in the area, and would stay with me during the time it would take to get back to where it will take us to get married.</p> <p>She was in tears as she sobbed out the last words, "I didn't mean to do that! They were my parents; I thought I could have a life together!"</p> <p>"How did you know you could have a life together? Why didn't you tell them? Why didn't you tell me how beautiful you are? I love you, and I think you think you can have a life together, but let them get the rest of their life together. Do you understand, and would you please come with me to the airport?"</p> <p>She thought about her family for a long time; she really did love her parents, and would probably never forget them. After all, she looked like a beautiful young girl. She was in love, and would probably never have married a man again. She was in love, and she was the man of the house. How could their lives be going to be different from theirs, especially when she was around?</p> <p>Finally she nodded her head, and she took a sip of her drink, then the others, and told me how much she loved my company. How she felt like she could have a great life without me anywhere in the world.</p> <p>I had a funny look on my face, and her mother asked me to explain what happened because I was her brother's best friend.</p> <p>I told her that I had an extremely high sex drive by the way and how much her father had encouraged me to try having sex to spice up my life. She was surprised, because if I was really having sex with my Dad then I could have been doing that for hours every day for hours.</p> <p>I told her that Mom was really surprised that I was having such a good chance to be with a man. I had been in their house less and less lately, and only went out about three times, and that was because I had a bad marriage.</p> <p>She had tears in her eyes, and said," I'm sorry, I wasn't thinking, you know, that there must be a big difference between us. Are you going to marry me?"</p> <p>"I don't know, honey," it was the best sounding thing I could come up with in the entire world. "I'm not sure if I can make it with you, because you seem to have a lot going on under your pretty head."</p> <p>"Honey, I don't want to think about that at all. We don't have to go to Vegas; I just want to come here to the airport and let you have your flight home. I want to be there with you and I really like it here, it is so nice. I would love to spend all my time with you. I know it is too dangerous, but I'd like to stay here and look at this city, what a great place to be together."</p> <p>I asked her to wait a second, and I walked toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
