As the waitress approached, she bent into the service and placed a glass on the end table. Mere seconds from her lips, I was staring directly at her tits. She caught my gaze and slowly took the glass. She took two more steps and she leaned forward and leaned in again. I watched as her boobs pressed into me. Once again, I was treated to her cleavage and I was sure that they were a beautiful view.</p> <p>We talked about our lives and the past five years and how life moved on. I learned a lot. Our families had been very supportive. They were very proud when we came out and had been supportive. Even now we could be proud if we had an empty stomach. Mandy was a lovely friend and she was also a sexy woman in our eyes. The restaurant had been a part of our family for most of our lives. We had a lot of fun together and it was fun to be friends with her.</p> <p>"You are so beautiful," I commented. Mandy smiled and giggled. She put out her tongue and ran it around the corners of her mouth. Meredith was very touchy-feely with her. I was feeling the same way. Meredith was giving me a sensuous blow job under her gaze. When our talk turned to our sex life, she was now sitting next to me in the booth. She reached over, gave me a kiss and whispered, "Your turn." We were kissing and hugging like teenagers again after our long vacation and we both broke away to look at our watch. We both got up from the table.</p> <p>Meredith took out a credit card and gave me her debit card. She paid her bill and made her way out of the restaurant and into the parking lot. She opened her car door and got into her car and began to drive away from the restaurant.</p> <p>I looked at Mandy and asked, "Are you sure?"</p> <p>She reached over and started to rub my leg softly. "It's going to be all right, Tommy. It's going to be all right."</p> <p>After a long, soulful embrace from our lips, we walked to the main street and I watched her as I watched her drive her car a little ways over and disappear from sight. She was driving a dream car. It's a two and a half-door that's a very upscale car, with multiple seats, three couches and a huge trunk. We both enjoyed the luxury, while being the first time we came across this convertible; Mandy had to drive our way around. We both took a chance on Mandy being a widow, although on the face of it it was a little too sexy for words. She had a very nice figure. She was a very sexy woman.</p> <p>The drive was very pleasant and Mandy kept up with our conversation. She was still the only married woman in the city and she was doing so well. We talked about some of the things we worked out during the trip and we both enjoyed being able to talk to someone as well. Mandy kept talking about her and her husband. They both enjoyed the company of each other and were very happy over their break from the military. Of course, they both appreciated the attention they received from other people as well. They knew each other well and they found mutual friends. After our business trip back to the beach town, Mandy and I spent several nights after we were off and fucking all over again. The sex was sensational. It was much better than I imagined.</p> <p>Meredith returned several days later and we were out to dinner in the bar. She and Meredith had brought wine and a bottle of Merlot along with a bottle of brandy. We sat and had both brandy’s. I looked at Mandy to see if she was a little affected by our conversation. She blushed as she put down her brandy and smiled. She was very flirtatious too.</p> <p>We enjoyed a few more drinks and a few rounds of cognac, before we retired to our respective rooms for sex. Mandy was very turned-on and could be difficult to conceal in her panties. Her pussy was still wet and swollen, her inner lips puffy and her dark clitoris sticking out. She was very sensitive and sensitive in the pussy. I could see a large bump in her thighs and her hips move toward each other and her legs quivered as they went back and forth.</p> <p>I was the first in my office that evening and Mandy and Meredith left about 10:00 p.m. at Meredith's apartment. Mandy had stayed late; she would probably be asleep by now, but she stayed late for a couple of hours before making it to hers. Mandy was in an unusually good mood. Her heart was racing, her pussy was wet and her breasts were swelling up and they swayed seductively. Meredith came out of her apartment—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
