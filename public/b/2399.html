But, my orgasm was not to last. I pushed Tom out from under me, pulled my panties back on, and stood by the window, my legs spread wide as a wave of sexual ecstasy washed over my body. After what seemed like forever, Tom slipped himself back into his shorts and buttoned himself up. He left the room briefly to get a change of clothes, and I was sure that he had left something for me to wear to the event. I was still lying there, still out of breath, having my pussy slowly recover its senses and was feeling very relaxed. Tom came back into the room, sat down at the table, and started reading a movie. Within moments, I felt the urge to return the favor. I quickly stripped off the remaining clothes I had on, and started to take off my t-shirt and shorts, and he stood up.</p> <p>“Do you want to do that tonight?” Tom was surprised by the question. He looked back to the movie “What movie did you see this time?”</p> <p>I didn’t answer right away, as what would have been an embarrassing question would have been quite a sight. Instead, I reached down and took his crotch and lifted his cock out toward the edge of the table. “I’ve been thinking about this for days.” I said, “Now, if you would just let me, I’d really like to do it!” He was in heaven. I had his hard cock in my hand as I lowered it down just a bit, letting it slide onto my belly just an inch lower with each pass on the inside my thighs.</p> <p>Tom wasn’t sure if he was dreaming, watching this film, or what, because we were moving to the other side of the window. “Are we taking this outside on public view?” Tom asked. “Do you want me outside for that?” I asked, “Or do we do something outside to see people walk by?” Tom smiled and nodded yes. I moved away, reached behind me and slowly lifted my skirt up, revealing my naked pussy to the world. Tom just stood in dumbstruck, looking on at my naked pussy, which was already dripping wet from the erotic touch of my fingers across my clit. I looked back to see him staring on me in a trance, his cock almost as hard as it was.</p> <p>I slid off the table, dropped my skirt down, and got on the floor on my knees between Tom’s legs. I pulled his shorts down around his ankles, and slowly moved my face to the hard cock in front of me. I ran my tongue from the base to the tip of it at the top of the head, moving it around to the sides. Then, all the while, gently pushing my tongue in to touch the underside.</p> <p>Tom’s cock had a large drop at the crown all the way to the tip, and the skin was so thin, I could only just flick the end with my tongue, which only seemed to drive Tom a little wild. He started to fuck my mouth very deliberately, but only a little, a moan escaping his lips. When it came to being in control myself, I had to fight the urge to pull my mouth away, a bit reluctantly. But, I didn’t want Tom to cum in my mouth, and I wanted to feel his warm cum in my mouth.</p> <p>I moved my hands slowly down to grip his cock, as I worked a little harder and faster with my tongue. Tom kept moaning to the point that he couldn’t hold on anymore and started to move his hips, trying to fuck my mouth. Finally, I heard him yell, “I’m cumming!” and he let go with his cum, splashing over my lips and mouth.</p> <p>“Oh, god,” I heard myself saying, “that was so damn hot!” And, knowing what had actually happened while I was licking his cum off my lips I did it again, in the same exact thing. Tom was out cold. My pussy was still throbbing with my orgasms as I lay there in the afterglow of my climax.</p> <p>I felt an overwhelming feeling of satisfaction. And with Tom right beside me, I was totally lost in my post-orgasmic bliss. Tom came back into the room, still smiling, and asked me, “So we're going to go back to your place after the show?”</p> <p>“I hope that what you had in mind is what I had in mind.”“ I told him. Before I could decide what I wanted to do, Tom had—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
