"Please use me.... I need to be used.... please use me for use.... use me for your pleasure."</p> <p>"You are a nasty slut, and a slut of the best nature, and what do you think of it for your pussy lips to be spread for use?" He asked me.</p> <p>My body was quivering with anticipation, and I just could not deny it. As I looked up at him once more, I felt his hand on my pussy begin to stroke it, circling my clit. I looked down at his hand, where it was caressing his cock, and it felt so much bigger that it felt like it was almost as hard as a steel shaft. So much larger than the toy. My body almost convulsed, as I held my breath and moaned my pleasure. It just seemed to feel more and more intense, and yet, the sensations seemed still as unreal to me as even my memory of the dream could be. And yet, I thought. It felt more and more intense, and yet, it wasn't a dream and it felt so real.</p> <p>"Oh yes. Use me." I heard myself say again, so low. I was trembling in anticipation of what was to come. And yet, it felt to me like I was being held in one of those velvet pillows that you could rest your head on if you're not sure how to relax your back. I thought back to that dream, where I slept in your arms, the feelings you felt as we slept. We were there, right under each other, but more, it was better. It was still the dark dream... so real... so good... so, so real... so, so, so much better.</p> <p>"Oh, honey. I'm going to cum.... so good...." He said against my leg, and then began to stroke his cock harder with the same speed his hand was stroking as he continued to play it with my pussy. "Oh honey. I can't control it. It's going to happen..." He started to pump my pussy harder with what felt like two fingers and a half and he began to spank me. "Oh, honey. You're my sweet, sweet little fuck slut."</p> <p>My body was jerked by the pleasure, and my breath was coming in short gasps, as my thighs trembled in pleasure. I realized again that I really wanted this to happen. And yet. He just kept pumping my pussy.</p> <p>"Do you need me to play with your cunt for you?" He asked me, so close to losing it. I could see the flush from my chest to my cheeks, and in between them. He saw me looking at him, and smiled.</p> <p>"You mean? I need you to play with my cunt." I said.</p> <p>"I want you to play with my cunt for me. I want you to play with it, honey. I want you to play with it." He said, again, toying with me, and then, before I was able to respond, he slid both thumbs under my thong and began to finger me more rapidly.</p> <p>"Oh, honey. It feels so good," I moaned out, as his fingers were working my pussy better, his thumb rubbing my clit, and his fingers on my pussy. My head tipped back and I looked back at him, smiling at him as I felt my breathing quicken at the sheer eroticism of what was happening. His fingers were getting wetter with each thrust of his hand, and I could feel his body moving on my leg, the heat from his cock and my cunt as it rubbed against the leather of the chair. I felt the first spasms shoot along his cock, he was starting to twitch and moan, and began to push up with his body onto my fingers.</p> <p>"Oh, honey. It's going to happen. I can't hold back. I'm going to cum. You're going to make me cum...." He growled at me, and I stopped to watch as his cock began to pulse, and shot. The first time I knew the word cock, it had been too long, and I realized that the cock just meant "make." "Come on honey, make me cum....." was the sound, as his cock jerked and shot a load of hot cream on its own, hitting my hand. I looked back over my shoulder and saw the look on his face. His eyes were glistening, and I could see the pleasure in them. It seemed like just seconds before we both felt it... it seemed like an eternity before he came. I felt him jerk, and he pulled back and then he pumped his cock a couple of times, and a couple of times. His body was moving, and I could plainly see the wetness of his cock on his hand now. He was looking at meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
