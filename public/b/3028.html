He came back in and looked very pleased with me. He gave me a kiss on the lips.</p> <p>"That was quite a performance you had last night, but there is more we promised you, and I think you deserved a bit of attention," he said, and I could sense him getting off his chair.</p> <p>"Yeah," I said, and he looked at me with wide eyes as his hand began to play with my pussy, which was by now soaked, and began to tingle. His fingers found my clit, which he held between his finger and thumb.</p> <p>He began to rub me at a steady pace, and brought his lips to my nipple. I gasped as he sucked on my nipple while his tongue flicked the bud, sending a jolt of pleasure through my body. I felt on fire and I was just afraid I might cum if he didn't keep stimulating me. I couldn't hold back any longer, and started to rub myself furiously against his hand.</p> <p>"Oh fuck," I cried as I came, squirting all over him and his hand. He held me in his lap and brought my wet pussy to his mouth, licking the juices off of his fingers. We both moaned softly as he sucked on my juices, then he stood, and took me into his arms. I melted into him, not letting him go, kissing him all over his face, neck, and chest. His cock was erect again, and pressing into my belly, and I knew his cock would not last long.</p> <p>I grabbed his cock with my hand and slid the head against my belly. I turned around and straddled him, placing the head between my pussy lips and lowering myself down. There was a brief moment of hesitation as my pussy opened to accommodate his dick, then I plunged him slowly deep inside me. "Oh God," I groaned. Then I began to slowly slide up and down, taking all of him inside of me. I could feel him rubbing against my clit as I rode him, the friction on my clit nearly brought me to the point of no return. I was in seventh heaven, and I could hear him whispering encouragement in my ear.</p> <p>"You're so good," I managed to say out loud.</p> <p>"I want you," he said, his voice hoarse.</p> <p>I was in heaven, taking him deep inside of me. Then I began to move up and down, up and down on him, faster and faster each time, my lips tight around his cock. He was making it hard for me to hold on, and my mind was spinning in bliss. I could feel a finger sliding into my pussy, stroking in and out. Soon, my pussy began to tighten around me, and then another finger joined the first, and soon I was crying out in bliss. When I thought I could go no more, I sat down on him and came again, soaking him. My pussy kept on squeezing him for the next 10 seconds till his cock began to soften, before sliding free of me.</p> <p>I got off the bed. "Well, you certainly got off," I said. He looked up at me and smiled.</p> <p>"Thank you, thank you so much, Sir."</p> <p>"Anytime," he said. Then he grabbed his clothes and left.</p> <p>I felt a wave of pride as I left the room, but it only intensified after I caught a glimpse of myself in my mirror as I was leaving the bedroom. I realized I was flushed and a little scared. In fact, I was more and more turned on all day. I felt his presence outside of the room until he was gone, and again I could feel the sexual tension.</p> <p>It was almost 7:30 am when he came into the room, and sat on the edge of the bed, pulling a robe on. I stood in front of him, and he pulled me close, kissing me deeply. He began to remove his clothes.</p> <p>"No, sit down," she said, and he did.</p> <p>"Turn over, pet," she said, and he obeyed, turning over, face up.</p> <p>"Good, I'm glad you're enjoying it. Now turn over, hands behind your head." I obeyed, and a sense of security began to flood over me. I was no longer alone, and I loved the freedom. As I sat on the bed I began to wonder, was this how he felt? What he wanted? Was he going to fuck someone else just to have a chance?</p> <p>"Sit down, and face me," she told me. I did, and she turned away.</p> <p>"Now turn over for me, now." I turned onto my back, and felt him position his cock at my pussy.</p> <p>"Now," sheâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
