"Last week when you took that last sip of your beer."</p> <p>"Was it the weekend?"</p> <p>"Oh no. That's the weekend," she said, smiling.</p> <p>I took a slow sip. She took me in her palm and held it for a bit, "So you came to see me, like, last month?"</p> <p>"Yup," I said. "It'd been about a year since we left for the mountains."</p> <p>"And," she said, then paused, "and what did I do that made you do it?"</p> <p>And so we talked about everything for a long time, until I was feeling that familiar sense of longing.</p> <p>"I want to go with that," she said.</p> <p>"Yeah?"</p> <p>"To get to know you better," she said, "and it's not just me, but it would be good for us to start seeing each other again."</p> <p>"Right," I said. "Maybe that's why I suggested that."</p> <p>She smiled and looked at me for what seemed like minutes, but we were hardly talking anymore.</p> <p>We walked back to our hotel, and again after a bit of small talk we realized we'd had enough of talking about last week. There was something I wanted to talk to her about, if only just a bit.</p> <p>"So," she said, taking my hands in hers, "if you ever feel like you're about to lose your job, I would like to know if I can be your next door neighbor, just in case, and you're going to give up smoking."</p> <p>"No, I like having a smoke," I replied, "it's a great distraction."</p> <p>"Good," she said, as she took a step closer, then turned around.</p> <p>I was looking again at her body, trying to decide if it was a good idea, but she turned up the corner of her robe and stood directly in the doorway.</p> <p>I couldn't say a word. She stepped forward and stood at my side as she said, "So, you'd like to, well, you know." And she smiled as she said it.</p> <p>"What?" I asked.</p> <p>"What do you think?" she asked. I think you might love the answer, that all that, right?"</p> <p>I smiled. "Yes," I replied.</p> <p>"But it's just a game," she insisted. That's all it really is. You could call it, I don't know. It's just a sort of a game I've played it."</p> <p>"I'd like that," I said with a nod.</p> <p>"I want that, too," she said. "It's just a game."</p> <p>I couldn't quite believe it, but I got a raging erection the instant I said it.</p> <p>"But I like your answer," she said, "and if you do then, then you'll win. So I'll just stay away."</p> <p>"Yeah, whatever," I replied.</p> <p>"Good," she said, then turned and hurried to her bedroom, which was by the bath. I heard her hurry, then hurried back to my room in just my boxers.</p> <p>It seemed like an eternity, during which we did talk just about anything, but when I went back into our room just a little later, she was lying on her bed, naked as a jaybird, looking up at the bed with eyes that were filled with a desire to fuck, right there in that bed.</p> <p>She was holding something in her hands that looked like a leather purse. I felt a feeling of jealousy when I saw that I'd never actually seen her holding it. Then she laughed.</p> <p>"So what's it for, anyway?" she asked.</p> <p>"I like it," I replied, then looked at her expectantly. "It's something new, just in case I change my mind. It's been a while."</p> <p>"I know, and it was so nice," she said as she picked it up, "But then, so was mine."</p> <p>Then she looked at me.</p> <p>"Yes, I still have the bag at home. I've got clothes and stuff in the car," she told me. "But I'm not going to take them off in there. I like to watch."</p> <p>And we talked, but there were so many things we could've said over the next hour that it felt like a lifetime. I was sitting on the king sized bed, naked and naked. I felt the pressure of her hand as she slid it under the bed, then her fingers on my cock. I felt her fingers on my nuts, then slide them up to my cock, which felt so sexy. When she wrapped her fingers around my cock, they wereâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
