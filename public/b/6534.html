I joked.</p> <p>"Oh no, we are just going to be staying out in the country."</p> <p>"I don't think you do. I think you're taking this trip for yourself."</p> <p>I couldn't disagree with that. We did. I had just a couple of weeks leave after having the trip in Afghanistan that we had to be together. I did get to go to one of my favorite cities. I had just been on the phone with my family for quite awhile with my best guy, my friend, my lover, a good life, when my friend and I both came along. We left together to go on another trip with my best man. He was my boy. We met that night at a local bar. He drank, I drank, and I was drunk. We got to my house. He was a sweet friend but there was no sexual relationship between us. He was a friend.</p> <p>The other night was fun. We were drunk. We had some good laughs. I started to feel guilty about what I had done. We were drinking, we were talking, and we were naked. I made a promise to myself, something that I never thought I would be doing. We went to some great sex and then went back to our room to fuck.</p> <p>And I really did love it. We didn't go to the wedding. We didn't go dancing. We were both nervous and a bit of a mess. We both got a little too drunk. We both ended up falling off the bed. We got out of bed and I woke him up. We ended up in bed and cuddled. We talked and I was feeling guilty. Then we started to be real. Sex is fun and it's not what we planned. We were just a couple fucking and falling in love. We were very happy.</p> <p>We went back down to the old house that had a pool out back. He slept in his chair and I curled up with some pillows, wrapped my arms and legs around him and just fell asleep. When I woke up this next morning I didn't feel as tired as I did the night before. I was so happy.</p> <p>I was looking forward to the next two months of summer school. All I had to do was be there for them and be accepted into the school. I had never had it looked like that. I had been there for months and I had done my part. So I was happy.</p> <p>I left for school the next day and went to the family reunion. I was excited as usual and very relieved to finally go back to school. It would be my first year of college.</p> <p>The reunion of course was over a month away. It was one of the worst days of my life. I sat at my locker staring at the picture of my parents and then my friend. There was no one there when the night came. I could feel all the weight of my life and I was so happy. We got out of there and I took a cab back to my apartment. I was feeling kind of lonely.</p> <p>Once inside I went straight to the couch and started to rub my hands all over my body. I had already decided that I just wanted to get out of being a party pooper. I don't remember all my plans. I guess I knew that it was going to be pretty exhausting. But at the same time I knew it was going to be fantastic. Finally I stopped and put down my empty bowl of cereal and sat down on the couch.</p> <p>I started to sit down again but I felt like I was being pulled in the opposite direction. My legs were still wrapped around my friend but now that we were both sitting on the couch on the opposite side of it it kind of relaxed me. I started to play with myself.</p> <p>I wanted to play with myself and I wanted my best friend to notice. I just tried to be casual that I didn't want anything to do with my best friend. But then there was this guy next to me on the couch. He had his arm around me. I couldn't help myself. I leaned over and kissed him on his cheek. He turned his head up and kissed me back. I kissed him on the mouth and his tongue went into my mouth. I had to get off the couch because suddenly there was a guy next to me. I think he was on my side.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, I was just on my way to the bathroom to grab a water." I said.</p> <p>"So you're happy to have me on your couch then?"</p> <p>"Hell yes!" I said as a smile. It was a bit loud, but what the fuck.</p> <p>"I am sorry, I'll be back in a moment." I said getting up. I grabbed the water cup and the water and walkedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
