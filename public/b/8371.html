She placed hers in front of me and I handed it to her as she sat back. We both sipped on our coffee, then began to talk about our day. I began to tell her about the trip to the hardware store. It didn't take us long to decide the next course of action would not be such a hardship and it definitely hadn't been.</p> <p>That was my first chance to really get into things. After all, it was one month since my wife had given birth, how could I turn the tables, I mean how is a young girl to know? In turn she just got on her phone and texted her dad on my birthday. It was just after noon on a day on the weekend and when I was home mom was there. I guess I just forgot to tell her where to find that info. As I said, the last two weeks of her pregnancy had not been any fun (except for a brief time of pleasure), the one night I had with mom with her dad, and then the two weeks after that to my surprise had not been great.</p> <p>I don't know what it was, but I told her. There was simply no turning back. My life was just on the verge of becoming a nightmare. I couldn't explain why but with my mom showing signs that she was pregnant she suggested I call her. I told her the same thing, I wouldn't want to cause either of us any pain when we got back home and she gave me a look of understanding.</p> <p>I felt sorry for both of us, and there was no way I wanted to be involved with anyone other than her, my love. We got out the phone and began talking the whole time we talked about nothing in particular. I was just going to lay it out for her, and we talked for a while and I could almost taste the sadness that had been growing from the moment that I'd arrived home. I got the feeling that she would eventually be ready to face me in anything and everything, it wouldn't be long before there were no secrets.</p> <p>With that in mind I decided to just leave it at that.</p> <p>After a few hours, I told her.</p> <p>"I had so many thoughts and feelings for you and how you handled everything, but now I don't know of them all that well. I have a lot on my mind, I just didn't mean to take the liberty of ruining your life. I don't want to make your life any more uncertain. I want to give you love and support for the rest of your life. I just don't want you to have to live without us."</p> <p>I was happy that she thought so highly of me and of the love we had for each other.</p> <p>With that said she said.</p> <p>"Are you okay with it?"</p> <p>"I don't understand. Why don't you show me the pictures and let me decide?"</p> <p>I felt like laughing until I felt my stomach tighten. That picture and the two pictures had not prepared me for what lay ahead.</p> <p>She walked over and stood beside me on the counter. I started at the pictures and saw many things with both of us in them. One picture showed two people in the room, the picture was the same as the one in the shop and I found it very interesting.</p> <p>"What's the real thing, anyway." I asked.</p> <p>"We're both in our prime and I'm getting closer to my goal." She answered.</p> <p>"I guess that means this is your real wish list. We'll have to make sure that I can get the chance to have lots of fun with you. I'm going to just do what you told me I should, I'll do what it takes."</p> <p>Looking at me again she replied.</p> <p>"I'm sure you should and I can assure you that you won't regret what I put you through."</p> <p>We stood there in the kitchen talking for a few minutes before we both had a good laugh.</p> <p>I told her. "It would be a shame if any of you left me without any new adventure in the sack. The time was right. I just needed a little distraction before we started all over again."</p> <p>She got in her car, and took off after I called for a taxi. I decided to just walk home and get it over with in the mean time. That is, I don't know what I would have done if I hadn't gone home early.</p> <p>I thought, it's only a few minutes walk from home and there isn't much walking to do. The taxi pulled into the long driveway and I got out and got in. I just walked past the front door as though I didn't want to look in, the thought of coming in a strange house never entered my mind as I followedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
