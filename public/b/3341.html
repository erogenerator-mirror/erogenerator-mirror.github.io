She kisses me quickly on the lips, then moves to my ear to ask,</p> <p>“Do you like my tits?” I nod. She continues kissing down to my neck to reach her hands around my back to start squeezing my tits. She pulls the top down so that I can give little licks, sucks, and flicked back and forth on my nipples then kisses one of my tits, leaving the other one for me to suck. I can feel her nipples hard against my own, pressing up against my chest. My pussy is on fire!</p> <p>She is still standing so she leans back slightly to place her hands on the wall. She kisses my tits, then places her mouth to my mouth to kiss me. Again, she pulls my top down but this time I pull the back up off of my shoulders so that I am now completely exposed to her. She kisses my neck and the small of my back to the top of my breasts and back. It's like a dance. Then, I feel my skirt being pulled upwards and feel my pussy once again being kissed and licked. My skirt is slowly lifted to my waist then pulled back. A finger traces my slit as it enters me, then I get another finger inside of me. Her fingers slide in and out of my hole as she continues to eat my tit. I can feel the wetness of her tongue inside, licking it out, making my whole body writhe. She has no restraint. She has driven me to the edge and I just know I am going to let it happen. Her tongue finds my clit and she starts sucking on it, making me buck and shake. The sound of it is too much for me, and I let out a scream. She continues to eat my tit and plays with my clit sending me over the top. Her mouth pulls away and I am left gasping and shaking in her hands. I don't mind her tongue. She keeps working at it, licking, then sucking. I am so full of sexual delight that I can't even feel the pain of my orgasm.</p> <p>She looks up and says, “I have to use my arms, I’m afraid I might collapse.” I lie, still breathing deeply from the intensity of the orgasm.</p> <p>She climbs on the bed and lies down with me, pulling me up for a kiss, then moving up to me, kissing me, my tits as I continue to shake on the bed beneath her. Our legs intertwine. Once again, I feel the wetness from my body, my thighs are sticky, and my insides are still on fire. We lie for several minutes in the after glow. I cannot move; I am completely spent. She kisses the corner of my mouth and says,</p> <p>“Thank you very much for a wonderful weekend.”—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
