One of her hands slipped from between my legs and found my breast. The nipple was like an eraser on my breast but larger in a more tender state. I couldn't help but gasp as her fingers squeezed and rolled the aching nub.</p> <p>"Oh, God! I'll never be able to find it!" I said my eyes still closed and my head rolled up.</p> <p>She laughed softly and held me tight as she continued playing. Every once in a while she would move her fingers out of my grasp and caress my nipples. It seemed to be the most wonderful sensation I'd ever felt.</p> <p>"It's time," she said as she released me from her grip.</p> <p>We broke the embrace and she moved off the table to one of the chairs. As much as I wanted nothing more than to return the favor she had done to my body I quickly stood. I took a moment to catch my balance and then quickly dropped down next to her as she sat up. I gave her a quick look and she took a deep breath before turning her body towards me. I leaned in and pressed my lips to hers.</p> <p>I kissed her passionately as my hands cupped her breasts and then slid over her stomach. I felt the heat and the texture, but could not be sure if she smelled her and I was still unsure. Eventually I broke the kiss and said, "Wow...that was...was...amazing was...it?"</p> <p>"Oh...I know I said 'wow," she answered quickly as she sat up.</p> <p>"So...you're saying how much you liked it?...," I asked as I slowly leaned in to kiss her.</p> <p>"I liked it...in a way," she answered softly as her hand reached for my breast.</p> <p>Our kiss quickly built in passion as our arms were drawn tight around each other's necks. Even though not a part of my past experiences was yet to come I could sense the same in her. One of her hands reached down to my thigh as they held me loosely.</p> <p>"I want this to be special, but...you...you don't feel anything you said you would...I mean, I...you're not a virgin!" she exclaimed softly.</p> <p>"A...are...you," I replied.</p> <p>Both of us smiled at each other as she leaned in again and quickly kissed my neck and then my shoulder. "Oh my...," she said as she pushed her face between my breasts.</p> <p>When my hands dropped to her breasts she took a second to look over her shoulder and say, "You're beautiful! I never thought I'd like you so much," she said softly before continuing to kiss me softly. "I'm glad we're finally going to be sharing."</p> <p>"You are, and you're gorgeous," I answered.</p> <p>"So am I," she answered.</p> <p>I smiled gently as my hands gently caressed her face and shoulders. I could feel her lips press against mine gently as I kissed her and I liked it. She had changed her lipstick. I knew there was some scent to it from earlier, but couldn't be sure if that was sweat or my ex's or anything.</p> <p>"There...that's better," she answered quietly as she continued to plant soft kisses on my lips. "I guess we'll just go with the flow."</p> <p>I smiled as I lifted my lips off hers and leaned forward to kiss her again. I felt her hands reach under my shirt and then slide it off of me. She gently lifted it off of me and it too floated softly to the floor.</p> <p>I looked over at her again not sure if she expected me to follow her lead or if she was going to start doing something. "Okay, I'll do the honors," she said as she pushed her legs open and reached down as if in a trance. It was too late for me to stop her by standing up.</p> <p>I pulled her up as I stood up and moved to the side of her. I pulled the bottom of her shirt over my shoulders before returning to my seat. Her arms moved around my back as we stood there kissing. I slowly slid my hands down from her bare arms to her waist and then back up as I moved a hand to her breast and gently pulled on her nipple.</p> <p>My tongue explored her mouth as her body moved slightly with the motion of our bodies. She broke our kiss briefly to draw my lips back up to mine and our tongues fought at each other. Her tongue felt silky smooth as it moved back and forth against mine. I reached over and undid the belt of her jeans where herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
