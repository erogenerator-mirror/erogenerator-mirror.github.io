I stood up and held her hand firmly. My mind raced. Here I had met her in the city and then to be held against a wall I would never be so safe inside her arms. The excitement of this new experience seemed to me to be too much to bear and I stepped back. She followed me to the door and we kissed lightly. "You will have to be the one. I know I have but we can do anything with you." I opened the door and found both of us stood by the car. She opened the window and started the engine. We started off towards our destination.</p> <p>Chapter 6</p> <p>We were at the end of the drive by the time we reached her house. I unlocked the front door and the porch light came on. She leaned over and said "My god I am cold."</p> <p>"You should be, I got into the middle of a snow. You looked so beautiful standing there with your skirt hiked up, you looked like a child waiting for presents."</p> <p>She leaned a little further and reached down. I watched the skin of her hand touch mine and I pulled her hand against mine, holding me as a symbol of her approval.</p> <p>"I would never lie to you. You have beautiful skin and eyes, like the rest of your family." She took my hand and led me to the side of the house. She pulled me toward the kitchen, turning to pull her sweater over her head. I stared and she stood there wearing only her bra. I tried to reach up, but she pushed my hand away, and told me to stop. She took my hand and led me toward the sliding glass door. She stopped and looked down at me, her eyes darkening, as she turned and faced the door and pushed me.</p> <p>The door shut behind us and we stood there, holding each other. I held her body from head to toe, rubbing the front of her bra against her. "If we were married we could still have this on." She put her arms around my neck and leaned against me. "Do you want to see me? I will see you."</p> <p>"I would love to." I said and pulled her sweater up over her head and off. She stood there a few moments before stepping into the light of the kitchen light. Her skin was soft and inviting and I stepped back to look at her. Her nipples were hard with desire and I was sure that we had been to bed when our desire had been so strong. Her breasts were small, but so beautiful. I had always wanted to hold and kiss one, but had never, ever dared do so before. I wanted to feel her nipple against mine. I stepped out of my pants and she lifted my hand to her cheek and we kissed.</p> <p>She pushed me back down to the kitchen table she had set out. I was so embarrassed and it was so exciting I started to cry. "I told you to tell me to stop. That it would just hurt me until it felt more natural for you. You had my body to feel you, and I still could not believe you were standing there in the light of the kitchen. Look and see; we were already married."</p> <p>She pulled apart from me and stood a few feet away; her hands were at her sides and she looked into my eyes. She took my hand and walked into her bedroom. She was obviously getting into the mood. I moved to get to the bedroom door. She pulled me to her and kissed me again. For the most part we were silent as she gently ran her fingers up and down my back, tracing my skin with soft caressing caresses.</p> <p>We reached the bed and she lay down and pulled of my shirt slowly. I slid in between her legs as mine were open and ready. She moved her pussy so she was right next to my cock, her nipples still hard. She guided me to her lips and I slipped into her, my head slipping in with a pressure that was beyond anything I had felt before. It had been the only sensation I had known, but at that point, it seemed like paradise.</p> <p>We lay together in the glow as it was, and slowly and easily enjoyed each other. She was a very beautiful woman. Her legs moved together rhythmically, moving me in. She kept her arms around me as her pussy moved against my cock, taking me into her, and then pulling it out again a little, and then back in again. She lay there for a moment, her face smiling at me, then she kissed me, and pulled me in with her arms. We moved together and made love for several minutes.</p> <p>She rolled me on my back and straddled my body. I reached to remove her skirt, but she moved the hand to my cock, not allowing it to enter. She pulled the skirt completely off before getting off me. I felt the wetness of her pussyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
