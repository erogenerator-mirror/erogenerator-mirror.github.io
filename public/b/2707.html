He went on to tell us that it had been a while since anyone had visited my place. He said he was in charge of getting the meal ready, and this was not a one and done kind of event. He said he had no objection to sharing the experience.</p> <p>With the meal set out, we all stood around talking to each other while we drank wine, talking about our respective classes, how we lived and where we had decided to start college. I was starting to feel a little uncomfortable with both guys touching me there. After a little while, I turned around in my chair to face them and started to put my hand on the back of their heads, feeling the hair tickling my finger tips, slowly running my thumb across their lips and chin. Our tongues danced together, I could see that it was beginning to push me over the edge.</p> <p>As I was watching my friends, the waiter approached and asked if we wanted anything to eat. I told him I would have a nice salad and that I would be right back and he came back with our lunch orders. As we sat back and ate our lunches, I was getting very turned on with all these feelings running through me, touching myself. I could feel my vagina starting to get wet and spread my legs apart slightly for them to see. They asked us to please sit up, so they could watch if we wanted to go further. As we sat back, they could see that my body had taken control of me and would have me naked in no time if I had asked them to touch me. I had felt so sexy in a long time with an audience so close. I told them that they were very nice and wanted to see more of my body. They quickly got up, took my clothes and took my hand into one of the bathrooms and asked if we wanted to go back to that room. Then I noticed they were looking us over from every angle. As we entered the room, they stripped off their clothes and left them on the floor at the door.</p> <p>As we all sat down on the sofa, their hands started to roam freely, touching each others' body as it happens, feeling the shape of their erections and their smooth balls.</p> <p>My friends moved me to the middle of the sofa and they started kissing each other, moving slowly down the inside of my thighs, and then moving all over me, their hands feeling everywhere. They ran their hands up my torso and around my breasts, each rubbing and pinching my nipples, taking the whole mass in hand, twisting them and pulling them and pinching them. I felt like I was going to die of pleasure. That was what my pussy was feeling.</p> <p>I started to moan with each mouth that was about to attack me. I had never felt a man touching me there and was totally turned on. My pussy was soaking wet and I could feel my juices flowing. As I felt the heat rising within, I had to grab his head pulling him closer. We were kissing and sucking each other's tongues, moving our hands on each other bodies, feeling with our hands and bodies. I could hear my juices dripping down and I pulled his hands down on top mine and he slid them down as much as my body would allow. He started rubbing his finger up and down on it, and then took it in his fingers and stroked it. We were feeling so good when he looked up to see my face with his hands working the lips of my vagina. My heart was going wild and I felt the waves of pleasure building inside me. I closed my eyes and just put my head back and came.</p> <p>When we stopped kissing, we were just holding each other, trying to move the sexual energy between us. Slowly, we moved our hands back to each other and got back into the loving embrace with our arms and legs. I could hear his breathing heavy and his breathing slowing down. When I looked into those eyes, I couldn't believe what I had just done. I could barely breathe with desire. I asked him if he was sure about what we were doing.</p> <p>He nodded that he was and we went back to his bed for more rest before dinner. After dinner, we went back to his room again to watch a tape of our evening together. When we watched her first, they were in the same position, kissing with hands roaming all over her body. I felt like I was going to die of pleasure. I had been looking for my own voyeur and this was what I was missing out on. I couldn't wait to find out how many other guys she had gone with.</p> <p>"Can we come again?" I whispered to him. He looked at me and nodded.</p> <p>We went down on the bed and started kissing and touching each others' bodies. He was running his hands over my body from my neck, down toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
