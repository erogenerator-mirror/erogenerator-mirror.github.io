My phone's a million miles away."</p> <p>"You can and you would have to get your mom's number."</p> <p>"What the fuck is this?!?"</p> <p>"What is?"</p> <p>He sat motionless for a moment, then asked, "How many of these pictures I have left?"</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"How many of these that you would have to take from a camera without being photographed!?"</p> <p>"How many?" she replied.</p> <p>"What?" he asked, perplexed.</p> <p>"How many of these that I saw? How many of those are still in my hands?"</p> <p>"You don't have to do this. It's not your fault I can't take it, you see, it just took the piss. I already deleted those as well, don't you see, that's the main reason I have me in this situation. Why does this have to be any different?"</p> <p>"I don't know, I suppose I can just send you my mom's number right now."</p> <p>"Well, if that's what you want, I'll just send it to you. It would take a lot of effort, wouldn't it?"</p> <p>"Nope, I already sent you that number, I've even sent both you and your mom's phone number to the person who asked them. You're just going to have to trust me to delete those pictures for you, won't you?" she asked, a glimmer of hope in her eyes.</p> <p>"Y...Yes," he said, not knowing what else to say.</p> <p>"Good," she said, as she stood up and faced him. "Get down on your knees, you idiot." He had never really thought she would do that, but here she was, naked below the waist. Her body looked very good to him, he supposed. The soft, feminine curves of her body, he looked up into her eyes, she was incredibly beautiful to him, and he knew she loved him.</p> <p>Trying to control his emotions, he looked up to see her looking back at him, the look of utter contempt there on her face, and he was very much under her control. He lowered his head as he knelt before her, feeling his heart hammering in his chest.</p> <p>"Kneel down," she instructed him, as she unbuckled his belt and opened it for him. He looked up at her with desperate confusion, a mixture of fear, lust, longing and desire on his face.</p> <p>"Get your head in the right position, and your jaw up close, yes?" she asked, as she grabbed his hair and pulled his mouth to hers. "Oh, you love that don't you?"</p> <p>"Yes ma-muuuuuugggg" he tried to reply, but she made him stand on his tiptoes as she pushed her hips against his face. "Yes master," he croaked, the pleasure of being controlled by this woman overwhelming.</p> <p>"Yes master, how can you say that? What am I?" she asked, letting go of his hair as he buried his face in her crotch and began licking her. His tongue flicked rapidly up across her smooth pussy lips, and his mouth closed tightly onto her engorged lips, sucking them between his teeth.</p> <p>"Y..you're such a slut, you know that, don't you?" she asked him, as his hands roughly began pulling on his hair.</p> <p>"Y...yes...yes I do master. This is my punishment..." he tried to say.</p> <p>"Hush or I punish you all weekend, you know that. Now, I want you to give me a handjob."</p> <p>She reached down between his legs and began stroking his cock through the thin material of his jeans. His hips lifted off the floor as his head and arms were lifted up, his hands held tightly to the arms of the couch. As she continued to stroke his cock, her thumb stroked his slit several times, tickling the opening of his cock, before moving back to his balls. As she continued to stroke, she leaned forward and his cock slid under the waistband of his jeans.</p> <p>"I'll be careful, you'll see. Now, I want you to take off the top of your shirt, so that I don't have to pull it right off. Take off your sneakers and your jeans, please."</p> <p>"Yes master," he said, as he slipped the top off, and then dropped his pants to the ground, leaving him naked from the waist up.</p> <p>She looked at him intently for a long moment, and he was breathing hard. "You like that, do you?" she asked him, in response to the obvious pleasure she was feeling.</p> <p>"Ummmm, god yes," he whinedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
