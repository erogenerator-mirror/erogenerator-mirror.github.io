'Honey, is Mommy home?</p> <p>'She was.'</p> <p>Nodding, I walked over to her. 'I was just going to go and grab an apple. I'll be right back.'</p> <p>'Okay, come by tomorrow.'</p> <p>'Goodnight.'</p> <p>I kissed her cheek and left.</p> <p>I felt like running to the grocery store to pick up a glass of juice, but at that moment I couldn't. I walked down the hallway for mom. She was standing at the kitchen sink drying her hands.</p> <p>'What took you so long?' she said as she looked at the phone in my hand. 'The wine?'</p> <p>'Oh yeah. I wasn't sure. I was watching TV.'</p> <p>'Oh. Is everything okay?' she asked, a little worried.</p> <p>'Well, I thought I might take a nap. Sorry.'</p> <p>I walked outside to dry and put the dry clothes in the tub. I put the food out on the patio table. The patio door opened and Mom walked out in it. 'Oh...my. How long have I been standing there?' she stammered.</p> <p>'About five minutes. How'd you know Mommy was home?' she asked nervously.</p> <p>'Awhile ago. Now, I really don't know. Why have you been standing here?' she said as she walked over to the door. The towel came with her. 'Come on, let's go inside. The wine is ready.'</p> <p>Mom sat down at the table and looked at me. She was just as beautiful as the day we met. And still, I was a little nervous. 'Nope, not at all,' I assured her.</p> <p>After she got to the table I put some cheese in my mouth to help me get the plate out. I looked back down at the table. 'So it's about getting to know you. I mean...how was Dad's funeral?' I questioned her.</p> <p>'It was kind of a long drive," she said.</p> <p>I turned to look at the paper on the table. 'Is this a bad time to go to a motel?'</p> <p>Mom shook her head. 'No. Sorry, no. It's sort of nice, actually. Just not for me.'</p> <p>'And you're alright doing that?' I asked.</p> <p>'Yeah, sure. That's good. I mean, I'm happy.'</p> <p>'Well, I'm sorry if that's all it was. But I was wondering. So are you coming for dinner? Do you want something to drink?' I asked, as we started off the conversation.</p> <p>'Yes. That would be nice. I'm not feeling good to drive,' she said.</p> <p>'You look a lot better coming in the car,' I said. 'It's nice to be around a beautiful woman.' I took two steps and leaned down to kiss her on the cheek, but she pushed me away.</p> <p>'I'm not wearing this,' she said as she stepped away from the table.</p> <p>'It's okay, honey. What will you have?' I said as she pulled back the cloth of her robe. 'Let's see what we have in the refrigerator.'</p> <p>'Sure,' mom said as she pulled her robe on and hurried to the refrigerator.</p> <p>I opened the top and pulled out three containers of vegetable soup.</p> <p>'Let's share this, shall we?' I asked as I got the first of the soup out of the refrigerator.</p> <p>'We're going to share this, shall we?' she said as she poured herself a glass.</p> <p>We took our dishes into the laundry room, where she pulled up a chair and settled in, sitting and watching me.</p> <p>I grabbed the last of the soup and took my stuff out of the dryer. 'Sit down, dear,' I said, as I handed her a glass.</p> <p>She reached back and took the glass, putting it on the counter and taking a drink.</p> <p>'What do you think Mommy's thinking?' I asked in the way a little boy always does.</p> <p>'She likes it, doesn't she? I like it. It's nice.'</p> <p>I took the soup and sat on the same chair.</p> <p>'She's thinking about our future together. Do you think we can keep it together? She really is interested in living together and we need to keep her happy.'</p> <p>'Are you kidding? That's how Mommy is. Isn't that right, Mommy?'</p> <p>'Okay, baby. We'll do everything we can think of to keep it together. But right now, what's keeping you so busy with your chores? Mommy and I need to go to bed early anyway,' she said.
