"I know your not from around here, or any of the things you say, but you're not the type to talk to the locals are you?"</p> <p>I nodded and shrugged at her. "I've just been living here for about a year, and I was just coming out with it. People don't come by here to talk about it much, and I didn't think about it then."</p> <p>"It's different now. People come by for a reason, they talk to each other." She paused again for a second, then spoke again. "You have no idea how many things have been going through my head since I came back. I have the same type of life that I have for the past 2 years. I've worked really hard to make the family I came from have a better life now. I feel like I can be myself with no guilt or concern. I mean, my life would not go without."</p> <p>"You are truly amazing. I still can't believe that this can get any better."</p> <p>I nodded in agreement. "You wouldn't think twice about changing that. How is it going for you?"</p> <p>"That is something that I don't want to know now. Even with all the things that have happened to me since I arrived here, I still haven't really learned how to tell people."</p> <p>"And you're not happy with that?"</p> <p>She nodded. "A little. The first time I changed things, I was surprised and pleased when I discovered that there are a lot of things not that a stranger can learn. It's as simple as getting a letter from a solicitor about it." She paused for a moment, and I thought I saw her tongue twitch in her mouth. "I'm not sure why I feel the need... for someone else to change things so quickly, but I'm not sure how I feel for them... or if I could ever change this for them. Maybe the fact that they have all gotten to the point with their choices, but my own personal, private decisions. I feel like I can't go on without trying."</p> <p>"I think you're right, although it's kind of difficult to admit that you haven't been happier than you have been right now."</p> <p>"Maybe I'm not as strong as I thought I was, but I've never really tried to make anything to change me in any way. I still like to work out, but I'm mostly just sitting here, trying to keep my mind on something else. You can feel how I'm doing too if you really like anything that happens here."</p> <p>"No... I don't. I mean, I'd rather not. I just..."</p> <p>"Hey, I have no reason to think about it either. I'm just getting this out of the way, so you can decide what you want to do in your life right now."</p> <p>She had gotten her point across, and I felt a lot more comfortable talking this way anyway, but I still had a hard time being open with her about all this. If she would just talk, I would have talked last night too.</p> <p>"So... do you have a place you'd like to stay for a couple of nights?"</p> <p>"No, it's just out of curiosity. There is nothing specific that I'd like to do here. There are a lot more... intimate things out here."</p> <p>"Can you walk me to the door?"</p> <p>"Of course!" I was surprised how quickly she said it, so easily. I had forgotten just how easy it was for her to say things like that to me, even just once. I also had forgotten just how easy it is to be a complete cock-tease, no matter the circumstances. I was surprised that she didn't seem bothered by anything else this evening.</p> <p>"Would I have to ask?"</p> <p>"Would you at least ask after what just happen? It doesn't bother you that much?"</p> <p>"No. I just don't feel like talking right now," I told her. "I just... couldn't talk to people that way around right now." I couldn't help myself from looking past her shoulder at her as she got ready to leave. "You didn't have to do anything like that to me, you know." I didn't dare say anything more, considering, but I did feel like a teenager again after seeing my friends naked this afternoon. She had said it, and I just realized that it was a lot easier to be a young adult than the 19 and 20 year olds that would be around.</p> <p>"No, that's a good idea though. It might be nice to have someone around." With her out of doors now, I could finally talk about myself as though there were evenâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
