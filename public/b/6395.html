The tone in my voice didn't go away. I was trying to find the right words.</p> <p></p> <p>"We're friends," I mumbled, almost falling out of my chair with a sigh and making him stop.</p> <p>"We're so much more," he responded, running his hands through his damp hair. "I've never been happier,"</p> <p>"That's because we're friends," he insisted, as he turned over into a full-body embrace and pulled me tightly to him. "When I look at you, I see the love I see in you and the love I want to give you right now."</p> <p>With that, his fingers went to the button on my blouse and he undid the top button from my pants before running his hand down my body to rub my swollen stomach. My hands went to the zipper to his pants and pulled it down as he got a firm grip of my breasts.</p> <p>"Your so big..." I moaned, moving my arms up to hook my arms around his neck. "I love you..."</p> <p>"I love you too," he whispered, pulling me close against him again, pushing my chair back from the desk and leaning me back against the desk. He looked into my eyes as I looked up from the desk, into the space between our arms, my eyes widening in shock, and I saw his smile. I smiled back as my fingers started to unbutton his shirt, unbutton it and slip it off before reaching my hand out to stroke his face, running my fingers through his dark chestnut hair.</p> <p>He slid his hands from my back, down my body, and ran his fingertip down the length of my slit, his fingertips dipping into the dampness between. His finger worked its way through my lips, making little circles around my clit, dipping a finger inside me a few more time before circling his wet finger against my hardening bud and pushing its way inside my pussy. I'm not sure how long we kept touching, but we kept on touching and sliding our fingers in and out of each other.</p> <p>His tongue slid through the length of my lips as my own went into his ear and he moaned against my neck. He knew exactly what I wanted, and he found it with a moan and a little push against my hard nub.</p> <p>"You feel so good," he said, running his hands down my body to grab my ass and pull me even closer to the edge of the desk.</p> <p>"We've never done this before, but oh, God," I moaned while leaning back against the desk.</p> <p>"We did it last weekend. It was a fantasy of mine. But now I'm really wanting to do this with you." He started to slide his finger inside of my pussy, my hips moving eagerly, trying to feel more of him.</p> <p>"I'm not sure I could last," I whispered, my words trailing off as a shudder ran through my body. "Do it slow," I urged as the pleasure he felt made my whole body respond in a way I had never felt.</p> <p>He brought his own hand up, slowly massaging my ass, before sliding his finger out of me and slowly moving his hand down to my wet pussy, his palm flat against my clit, sliding it up and down as his other hand pulled me closer again to him still.</p> <p>The sound of his hand against my pussy was a surprise to me, not to his, but a bit of pleasure from it nonetheless.</p> <p>My body tensed as his finger slowly circled my clit, before pulling back with a quick flick of his wrist and sliding back up to the tip of my clit, the pressure there making me jump. He brought his hand up to once more my ass as he started to rub it, giving my clit an extra flick before sliding down and back up my wet hole.</p> <p>"I want to come," my body said, the pleasure so overwhelming, my voice a whisper. I had never said that to this total stranger before and I liked it, but the feeling of something happening at that particular speed, the power of it all, was an amazing sensation.</p> <p>He didn't even need to be asked. When I looked in his eyes, he looked almost disappointed as he dipped his fingers inside me, finding my g-spot and pressing it while his other hand rubbed the outside of my pussy. I could feel it every time it slid across as my body bucked around his hand and the feel of his fingers pressing into my walls, sliding around and around, hitting me like a toy and teasing me with their strength. It sent me over the edge as my body shook against the desk and I arched my back and bit my lip to keep from screaming out as I came and came for him. The orgasm was so intense I could almost feelâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
