I said.</p> <p>"I really need a quick shower anyway. I got a really hot shower. How's breakfast?" she smiled.</p> <p>"I'll try. I think it will give the boys stamina to play. If you don't have any left, we can play again." I said.</p> <p>She just looked at me for what seemed like a moment. This was the start of a strange relationship, yet I kept it to myself. We didn't see any of our fellow co-workers there that night but we saw quite a few that night. It seemed an interesting coincidence. We both laughed at the sight of each of them. We went back to the pool and sat and swam for several hours. It was pretty hot outside. When I got up to go to bed, my hand found an empty corner of the pool. I started playing that again. I didn't finish. I came home and made myself breakfast. I went into the bathroom and closed the door. I sat down at the kitchen table. I knew that they probably were watching. My hand was down between my legs. I started thinking about how much we did have in common.</p> <p>"So what's new with you today?" she smiled looking into my eyes.</p> <p>"You know." I answered as I turned to look at her.</p> <p>"Sure, whatever," she laughed as she stood. I watched as she bent over in front of me. With her skirt barely covering her ass, she walked around the table to the table and sat down. She sat at the table and took a sip of eggnog. I finished off my breakfast without having to touch my coffee. I took a sip of mine and walked back to her. I sat down next to her as she finished eating. We talked about our lives for the first time, before I was even aware of sitting.</p> <p>"So, what do you think?" I asked.</p> <p>"He is such a nice boy. He's also quite smart. I mean, I'm not really into guys. I think he's just kind of immature. No boyfriend." She said.</p> <p>"I think so too." I agreed.</p> <p>"He's funny too. We talked on the phone before." I said.</p> <p>"Yeah, good to have an ear for." She said.</p> <p>"No, we won't date." I said.</p> <p>"But, the idea is fun." She said.</p> <p>"I think so too."</p> <p>She got up and hugged me tight. She kissed me on my lips, and then leaned in and kissed me on my lips. We continued to chat throughout the rest of the morning. She had one of her hands resting on my thigh, which made it very easy for her. I tried to get out of her arms. We sat there in silence for the rest of the day. I think we were both looking for a way to get home by evening. But, we had a lot to discuss.</p> <p>After dinner, she went upstairs to get ready. I got up to make sure everything was ready. I went through her bedroom and put a few pillows to keep up on the bed. I looked at it as I went. I was thinking that we should go with her. I had never cheated or even done anything that actually got us in trouble. We could still do some sexy things with others.</p> <p>I got myself ready and went into the lounge room. I sat down with my coffee in my hand and took a sip. I thought about our relationship and what we could do in it. After about an hour, she came downstairs. She was looking very sexy in a short little nightie and matching panties. Her face flushed as she walked to the kitchen table. I followed her outside.</p> <p>"You look really sexy today, by the way." she said as she approached the table.</p> <p>"Thanks again." I smiled.</p> <p>"You're looking pretty good yourself. Do you have sex with your son?"</p> <p>I looked at her and shook my head.</p> <p>"Nope, why?" she asked.</p> <p>"What do you mean?" I said.</p> <p>She took my hand and placed it on her ass. "Well, you don't see him very often do you?" she said as she looked over her shoulder toward the street.</p> <p>"No, I just can't get around it." I answered.</p> <p>"If I'm too much, do you want me to come over and help you get ready? We can get you some clothes." she said.</p> <p>She seemed quite happy about what I had said. "Sure." I said as I held her hand.</p> <p>She came over and sat down right next to me.
