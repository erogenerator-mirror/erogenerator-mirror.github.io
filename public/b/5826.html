She knew what she must do. She had to. She had done so before, at some time and other place in her life. It was such a shame that someone might see her and look in her eyes. Mallory could not look away now. Her eyes were full of tears yet she would not do it again.</p> <p>"No," she whispered.</p> <p>"No what," Mallory repeated. Then her eyes fell on her phone again. Her phone that was not home. She looked at the display and saw that was not a text. It had been sent once. Then again only a message. Her husband on the other end had written. 'Not a phone. It looks like I have to go.' She looked to the phone hoping that the message had somehow been the word of a girl. Not to her husband who had written it. Not some young girl, she thought. It was from her. A boy, in some way. She could only hope; that her husband's words were indeed a boy. For those words had been written by other men she had never even seen.</p> <p>But, it was all a big secret. All these things she and her husband had talked about. But now she knew now that it was all a big secret.</p> <p>Mallory looked down at the phone and saw that it was only to voicemail for her.</p> <p>Mallory thought briefly of getting up, making herself at home, but did not. Instead, she closed her cell phone and looked up the message with the phone open to her stomach. She could almost see the words, 'Dear John. I am going out of town for a few days. Can you come over soon? Please come over. xxx.'</p> <p>But as soon as the sentence had finished, it hung up.</p> <p>She stared at the phone for a few seconds and then put her cell phone back in its place and stood. She looked round the house not once doing anything but collecting stuff from the couch. She could have left the phone there but there was no time.</p> <p>"Oh. I don't have enough clothes. What's the matter with you tonight," she said aloud.</p> <p>"I'm sorry," she said. "I shouldn't do this. It's all so wrong."</p> <p>"No, no. You're my lovely wife so maybe this is a good time to stop and change," she said as she took a step back.</p> <p>"I could get my things," She continued. "I just need a change of clothes...and maybe some underwear to wear. Do you have anything sexy or sexy about?"</p> <p>"Nothing. No one would ever hear of it."</p> <p>"Good." Mallory took another step and walked over to where her purse was. Opening it she took out her purse.</p> <p>"I hope I didn't forget." She said to her husband. "I don't think I would have been in the living room in the middle of anything if you hadn't shown up."</p> <p>"No worries," he smiled. "You were in fine condition, my lovely wife."</p> <p>"Well the next time I hear from you you make me want to come down and eat a hot meal." And with that she laughed. "I'm sorry."</p> <p>"Sorry for what," she said putting down her purse. "No worries, I promise. I will have to take my lunch out before I go."</p> <p>"There's not much here," he said looking out the kitchen window. "Do you need someone to dress you up?"</p> <p>"No. I'm not going to wear anything just for you," she quickly said. "Just a bit of a change so it'll be good for my complexion." She smiled nervously and pulled back a sheet of toilet paper to wipe it down.</p> <p>"Will we be able to do this again, after your trip out?" he laughed. "I have a hard time deciding. I'd like to be a little more daring in the future."</p> <p>"As long as it doesn't get too ugly," she cooed. Then she turned to look at him and said, "I do hope you don't mind."</p> <p>"No, not at all," he smiled. "But there is no need to hold back here. I'm glad to be able to get a job."</p> <p>"I can't help it," she said. "I just feel as though I owe you something. And I'm so excited to be able to do this so I would prefer you didn't take me too far."</p> <p>"Not a problem. It wasn't so far away that you wouldn't be in the situation," he smiled. "I was just kidding. That's all.
