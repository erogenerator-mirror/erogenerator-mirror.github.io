I couldn't make it. It's too late now! You should get dressed so we can go see what is on in your apartment."</p> <p>With that she picked up the phone and pressed the answer button before she even saw the grin on his face. He had taken her phone before she left him, and now he was just chuckling. He hung up the phone and told her that he had to go to the airport and left. He was hoping she would come home and they could spend some time alone together, at least that is what she told him at the airport.</p> <p>But she was not to be disappointed. She was still naked.</p> <p>John got dressed while she was still in her black robe. They would go back to her apartment and she would be all yours. She told him to get out, and she would be over the next day to have dinner with him. Just to make sure she was ok with anything.</p> <p>*</p> <p>Note to reader that it is my opinion that I was wrong about her.</p> <p>Comments and feedback are welcomeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
