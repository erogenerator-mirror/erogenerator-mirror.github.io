The sun was still bright and they could see the small pool where they had stopped. They went to her and he helped her up. They went to a table and sat around. Just as she closed her eyes he leaned over and kissed her. It felt so good. She had never been able to do anything like that. When they finished kissing she got up and sat on the table. It was time for that massage and she wanted to feel his bare chest next, even though it was the first time he had ever touched her there with his hands. They had a good session with him rubbing her legs while they made love.</p> <p>Then it was time for her to get out of the tub. She had never felt anything so intimate. She had thought of this as the first time she ever touched herself. That thought scared her. Her husband was not there. Was it a disease? What would she do next? It was still an unknown. She was not sure if she was ready to go back to that place. Did men do that to her? What would it mean as a mother? What would he do next? She had an uncontrollable urge to know more about this. It was hard to talk for the first time since we got on the boat. They sat drinking and talking, talking about the previous days. It was nice to talk to him and he had been so understanding and understanding all the time. Then it was time to be on the boat again. She walked around the cabin for a little longer and then turned to him. It was a good feeling to have him in her again. They sat next to each other. He took her chin in his hand and leaned down to kiss her. It made her feel good! She opened her mouth for him and they kissed. They were not just kissing. He was kissing her in her soft mouth and she was feeling good.</p> <p>He pulled away and looked at her and was surprised to see she had the towel on her lap and that she also was wet. He said, "I want to do it with you."</p> <p>Linda was about to say something but stopped when his hand went to her wetness. She let him do what he wanted without complaint. She just sat there a little longer as he rubbed her. Then she felt him lift the towel. Her heart felt heavy as his hands came up to her breasts and they were so soft and full. She loved the feel of his hands on her, feeling her full shape and the fact that his hands did not cover any of her skin all the way down to her ass. She loved that feeling of being so naked in front of him.</p> <p>They kissed and hugged for awhile and then she said, "I want to do it, too."</p> <p>They spent the next few hours. They took turns on the bed and in various positions. It was a very sensual and sensual night.</p> <p>When it was time to go home his hands kept on her. They had their good old time on the boat.</p> <p>When they were alone Linda said, "I know you don't think we should do this again, honey. However, I just want to feel you again."</p> <p>"Honey, don't we want to have a good time on the boat?"</p> <p>"What do you mean?"</p> <p>"I mean, I just want to give you a present to remember."</p> <p>"I don't have anything to give, honey. You are not wearing anything yet. Why don't we have a special birthday present for you?"</p> <p>"I think it depends on how much I make. Let's go to our room right now."</p> <p>Linda had been getting all worked up about what she had said. She thought about it for a little while. She thought it would be fun to make his birthday special again, as long as it didn't involve sex of any kind. She wondered if she could give him a memorable birthday. Would it make it any less of a surprise to him if she put on a sexy nightgown and sexy lingerie for him to get his attention again?</p> <p>Before she had time to think of it they were in her bed. She kissed him and told him that she would love to do it again, after she made it special. He said, "We had better change that, otherwise we will have to go back to the cabin."</p> <p>Linda didn't feel too guilty about it as it was her first time with another man. The thought made her heart love him a great deal. After they were in her bed after an hour of kissing and feeling she said, "But I still think it would make us both memorable."</p> <p>"You have been with a lot of other people, and they all know your body better than you do." "But you still have to tell them about your feelings and what is expected of youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
