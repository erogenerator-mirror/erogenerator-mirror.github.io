"I think it's really important for you to remember the history of our relationship. It was different after that."</p> <p>We lay back in the tub and I watched the water run down her gorgeous body. I felt a warm hand stroke my leg as she said," Do you want me to keep my clothes on? I can just reach up and take care of you with my mouth."</p> <p>My dick rose with every question that her question was asked. It was an instant rock hard erection, waiting for the right moment to rise and go home to me. The day had been crazy and I wanted to play every moment of it at least if not more. I reached over to her and put one hand behind her head and as if on cue, let it drop to the water's edge. I began to kiss her long neck and her eyes looked into mine. She parted her legs so I could lay my body against hers and my dick slid easily between her thighs. When I touched her, she turned her head to kiss me and I could smell the scent of her perfume which drove me harder still.</p> <p>I could see tears in her eyes, her nose running in and out. I pushed one arm under her, supporting her small frame on to it. A warm hand slid down my stomach to my erection and I felt her soft fingers stroke me.</p> <p>"Mmmm Daddy. You are so hard right now."</p> <p>"It's not just about you, honey." Her voice was thick and raspy and it made me jump when I heard her voice say that.</p> <p>Her fingers were still stroking the shaft, her mouth wet with her own saliva as she looked into my eyes. I pulled my fingers out of her and moved down her neck. I wanted to kiss her so that she would know what my lips were going to do. I moved her hands away from her face and laid them softly on the edge of the tub. She held her arms straight up as I took her breasts and teased them.</p> <p>"You can do anything you want. I just want you to touch me. Don't tease me Daddy."</p> <p>Her face was flushed and her breathing was coming in short, quick bursts. I wanted to tell her how much I had liked it when she took me back in her hand, but her words were too much and I went on.</p> <p>"I want you to stay as you are today. If your parents don't show up, and if you do something special, that is when I will be your Daddy."</p> <p>With those words my cock erupted and made a thick, creamy white mess of our bodies. We kissed and kissed and I felt her fingers stroking me. I knew I would cum again soon. I was too excited to care. It felt so good, I didn't care. I wanted to taste her lips, stroke her breasts, and make her feel good.</p> <p>I could feel my sperm begin to run down her throat and I wanted to drink it each time I came, but I did not want to ruin the moment by giving up my orgasm. I was too excited. I wanted to make her feel good, I just needed to make myself feel good. "Okay girl."</p> <p>"Yes baby that's for you." I reached down and took hers and put it to my lips, feeling our mingled juices as I savored her taste. I felt her lips close against mine and my dick exploded inside of her. All I could hear was the sound of her voice in my ears.</p> <p>She lay between my legs as her breathing began to calm, she kissed my cheek, then my mouth and I said, "Thank you for letting me make a girl feel good." She smiled, leaned in and kissed me lightly again and said, "I love you Daddy."</p> <p>When our kissing ended I reached over and ran my fingers through her hair, then said, "We better get some sleep." Then I turned on to my side of the tub and we both laid back with me under her. I had a few thoughts in mind to take us somewhere we could be againâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
