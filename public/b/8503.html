"You said you didn't want a fight because we were getting too much in to each other. You just said we needed to get back to normal. I mean, it's not a big deal," he explained. "We were just going to have a quickie."</p> <p>"You're such a pig. You want to see how it go?" she said with a bit of scornful note.</p> <p>"No, I'm serious. We'll go on a date tonight," he said. "The next time you're here, when I want to go out with you, I'm going to wear this condom. Do you want me to wear it or not?" he chuckled.</p> <p>"No, that's fine," she said. "And I will enjoy the hell out of the fact that you're going to be wearing it," she said, grinning.</p> <p>"You'll like this."</p> <p>"Really?" she asked with a smile. She reached out to put the tip of the condom on.</p> <p>"Absolutely."</p> <p>"Thank you!" she said. She looked back at the time. It was three minutes after her brother's car pulled into the driveway.</p> <p>She walked over to the door and rang the bell.</p> <p>"Open the door a second," he said. He walked over to the phone, picked it up, and hung up. Then he opened the door.</p> <p>"Honey?" he asked. She peeked around at him. "This is you, right?"</p> <p>"Uh huh," he said, putting his arm out.</p> <p>"What happened? I want you to get up now," he said with mock sternness.</p> <p>"Oh," she said.</p> <p>"Get to the couch, right?" he asked. She nodded her head and then he sat down. He reached over and pulled her back to him, kissing her passionately. His arms went all around her, pulling her close to him.</p> <p>"I want to do something before," he said, pulling back. He looked back to the clock.</p> <p>"Why are you so late," she asked.</p> <p>"Because you're too tired. I want to do it." It was a half lie, but she knew it. It wasn't the kind of thing that she would normally do on the weekend. Besides, she wasn't sure he would actually fall asleep. He looked around. She was standing behind the couch, leaning over, kissing his neck. He turned towards her. Their lips were pressed together as he put his hands on her breasts. He pulled hard and she moaned into his mouth. He had put his hands under her shirt, and she could feel them slipping below his ribs up to his nipple. He moaned into her mouth, and then he began unbuttoning her dress. She turned and kissed him again.</p> <p>"Mmmmmmm..." she said, pulling away. He had worked the straps of her bra off, and dropped back to his knees, pulling her dress down over her arms. He took it off as she kicked off shoes and socks, and she reached around to free of it. He slipped his hands up over her arms, pinning them to the arms of the couch. She stood there, arms cocked, looking down at his face, looking down at him. She felt her nipples press against the satin of her bra.</p> <p>"There's a button," he said, sliding the waistband of her shorts out of the way. He unclasped her jeans while she watched him. She pulled them down her legs, and he pulled them completely off, tossing them onto the floor before she could put them back on the floor. He reached around her and pulled off her sneakers, before she could stand. She looked at him, with her eyes wide, as he pulled off his own shorts. He stood up and stepped out of his pants. Again he grabbed her, pulling her to him. She felt him kissing her lips, her neck, her breasts, the sides of her stomach, and then she could feel his lips pressed to her pussy, which was already wet.</p> <p>"God, you're so wet," he said. "I'm not even going to try to do it." He reached down and put her hand on his cock, which was already straining against him through the panties. He pushed his briefs down, freeing his cock. She wrapped her hand over his thickness, and he looked into her eyes as he grabbed the waistband of the panties and pulled the panties off her hips. They fell to the floor, and he put his hands all over her, pinching her nipples, pulling her to his body, and pressing into her body.</p> <p>"Oh, god, I want..." she began. "I need..." she stopped mid-sentence. "I need something," she said.
