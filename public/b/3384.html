He pulled the laptop off the lap, and set it on the coffee table. I looked up, and he was leaning back.</p> <p>"Well, how did you want to start?"</p> <p>"Well, if it's going to last, you've got one hell of an ass."</p> <p>"Well, I don't get it," he said with a slight nod. He looked down at the laptop and held out his hand to take mine. I took it and he got up and stood at the sink. His face was pale in a white uniform shirt, and I could tell he had been working with some heavy machinery, something to do with a metal crane. "This is an expensive and expensive tech, and you're probably not going to buy it, even if it's for me."</p> <p>"So what are you going to do?"</p> <p>"I'm going to buy this laptop," he said, and I saw his eyes narrow and narrow with anger.</p> <p>"And what are you going to do, then?" I said.</p> <p>Again, he looked down at the laptop and said, "I'm going to buy it." And he pointed at it again, with the head of his hard dick visible above the desk. "I'm going to go over to Mike's, and we'll start making an investment."</p> <p>"You should. Mike works with me."</p> <p>I knew there was some truth in that, and I had thought it too. But there was no way I was getting into an affair with a guy in his office. "No, I'm not," he said, "but I do know you'll have it all figured out for a little while. I'm not going to lie, I'll make it too easy."</p> <p>I knew I should be getting away, but I just stood up and walked back to the desk. There, I found our old agreement, on paper, on a slip of paper. I had done it the first time we'd done this, and he hadn't read it. I handed him the laptop, and he started writing.</p> <p>"Good night," he said.</p> <p>I closed the laptop, got up from the desk, picked the laptop up off the desk, carried it over to the table I worked at, and turned it on. He had just left, and I turned up the volume a little, just enough to talk to him. "I'm going to sleep," I said, and he went to move the laptop over and set it down, but he stood up again and said, "No. I still have a job to do, I'm not going to do anything stupid."</p> <p>"No, you're going to stay. You do it and I mean it. And I will," I said, and I put my head down on the table.</p> <p>"But if you stay, the company, your sister, your mother, your brother, the whole company, everything, it could have a serious future for you," he said.</p> <p>"I already told you I love you," I said, "and I'll stay. If I don't, I'll leave."</p> <p>"No, if you stay, you will stay. If you stay, stay and never go back to work," he said. He took my hand and stood up. "And Mike's office's closed. I'll have to call back the day after. How about it, John? We can work together. In fact, I'd like to start the partnership with you. Do you know where Mike's office is?"</p> <p>I shrugged, and said, "I don't think so. Mike's gone now."</p> <p>"Well, good luck, and good-night," he said, and he picked up the laptop from the table and started walking off.</p> <p>I turned it on another volume, and said, "Okay, but don't come back to work until morning. The sooner you do this, the sooner this meeting with Mitch, and I'll start making some money." I gave my phone a nervous chuckle, and he looked at the clock.</p> <p>"Alright, if you really wanna stay, this will do you good. Now," he said. I grabbed the laptop off the table and opened it, went to where our agreement stated, and placed it on the table. I was halfway there, but his eyes started to drift away. I stopped him, and walked the laptop over, opened the software, and looked at the laptop. It did not look bad at all, but the quality wasn't the same as it used to be. I got up and walked over to a corner of the desk, picked up the tablet, and set it down.</p> <p>"This is going to be better than Mike ever could be. He can write a nice new software."</p> <p>I reached for the laptop, and his hands were gone, but his eyes stayedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
