My eyes were glued to her. Before I knew what she was doing, she put one hand down her pants and pressed two fingers into herself. I couldn't take my eyes off the sight, I wasn't the first one she had been with on their honeymoon, and so was very hot for her too.</p> <p>"Oh, my," she said, pulling her fingers out and then licking them delicately. "We're getting too close."</p> <p>"Yeah," I agreed, feeling really horny at the sight of her.</p> <p>"Do you want to see?"</p> <p>"Yeah."</p> <p>She smiled, kissed me deeply, stood up and peeled back the band of her t-shirt that covered her breasts. She turned around, peeled the last button open and peeled down her panties. When they dropped, I saw that her pussy lips were thick and black and long. Her bush was shaved bare with thick, dark hair, and the rest of her body was exposed, long, lean, with curves everywhere. Her breasts were small, I guessed an A cup, but that didn't matter to her, they looked fabulous.</p> <p>"How do you want me?" she asked.</p> <p>"Go down on my knees."</p> <p>She smiled, lowered her legs and knelt down. I slid down the chair and got between her legs. They were long, smooth and perfectly formed. She guided my face to her clit and I began to lick her pussy. It tasted wonderful, slightly musky and sweet. With her eyes shut, she just smiled at me, her head thrown back, her feet flat on the ground, her back arched, her arms hanging out above her, as she moaned and made noises that indicated her pleasure.</p> <p>I was on my knees between her legs again, my cock sticking up in the air, when she took it in her mouth and rolled her tongue around it. I knew what she wanted, so I began to slide into her pussy, then out again, and then in again. We kept this up for a while, kissing and rubbing and feeling and making noises and enjoying and licking, feeling the tension building in her loins, and feeling her body getting warmer and wetter and my cock hardening and getting harder, when she started to cry out and shake. I felt her start to lose control, saw her hips shake and quiver. I pulled more of the stickiness from her lips as she came, felt it flood over my fingers as she pulled me down to her, and I licked her, feeling the muscles in her arms contract around my neck, and felt her body go stiff again. That set me over the edge. I thrust in and out of her faster and faster and then she cried out loudly again, then came again, harder and more quickly than I thought possible. I pushed in as far as I could, feeling her hot hole grip my cock with each wave of her orgasm.</p> <p>She rolled her head back and then looked at me.</p> <p>"That was the best thing I've ever felt in my life. I didn't think you could do that."</p> <p>"You do?" I asked, still somewhat drunk and trying to make sense of this beautiful view.</p> <p>"Yeah," she nodded. "I thought it would be a bit different."</p> <p>She stood up and pulled her panties off. They fell down her legs, onto the carpet, where she was standing, completely naked. She was proud too of her body, especially her breasts, which I guessed were bigger than mine, and had to be at least a C cup, but they were full and perfect, the slightest bit of sag, and very round. She turned around and bent over to pick them up, giving me a good look at the curve of her ass beneath the black fabric. I looked her over from top to bottom, the roundness of her thighs and the shapely globes of her ass, then back to her face, her eyes still closed. She reached back and grabbed my erection again, which was still poking out of my pants, and led me into the bedroom, taking a moment to pull her panties off and lay them down on top of her clothes. I took a step back and looked over at her, then turned, pulled her towards me and we kissed, her arms going around my neck again as I felt her legs coming around mine.</p> <p>"I didn't know, I mean I know everything, but I'm sure that's all I was supposed to do and say," she said, looking me right in the eye. "But just so you know, I'm never going to forgetâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
