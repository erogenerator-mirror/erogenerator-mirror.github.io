I responded. "I'll need to talk to you about this." I replied. "Don't mention it though, but I just can't. It's too dangerous."</p> <p>She looked at me worried for a second. "Don't worry about it. I understand it, and I want you to think about it in the right way. Can we start tomorrow? No pressure." She replied quickly.</p> <p>"Alright sure." I said as I left them alone. I took off a robe and followed the trail into the grove. The first thing was a trail through the trees which led to the small grove of pines at the other end leading to the small creek. I had decided on my own path which was a bit of a risk since I didn't need any extra clothes. A few minutes into our walk, I passed the small pond where a waterfall ran. I knew if I took a shower, it would clean up the mess that was being made by the creek.</p> <p>"That is pretty damn cold," I said quietly.</p> <p>"So are you going to join me?" She asked as she stepped out of the water. I had no idea how to respond to that. She had never before voiced any thought towards us being friends.</p> <p>I shook my head and thought about that. "I think I've had more than enough." I responded, "It's not like we're doing anything. I'm being honest with you."</p> <p>"I know, but if it's okay with you that is. What's wrong with that?" Her questioning me was innocent, but her question made me feel even more uncertain.</p> <p>"There isn't anything wrong with that. It's... it's just that... Well... when we were growing up..." I continued, taking a deep breath. "My dad was a little older than my brothers. He had one sister or another. They'd both passed away when we were little. I think it was kind of sad that mom hadn't been able to attend to any of their lives while growing up. Mom wouldn't talk to me at all. As you can see she didn't have much left of her family to talk to either about her and dad. It was just one of those things. And I don't blame my best friend who has been through so much. After our parents passed, there was just this one child, a little girl, he didn't have a lot of time to himself. But..." I was starting to feel a little uncomfortable with her being right in front of me. This was my first trip in years with someone else because that was where their relationship had gotten started.</p> <p>"I don't blame you for finding some reason your father never had the time to be with anyone. He never had anything going for him either. But I also know he never had what I did. And yes, I should have been a support to him. But I was never... a friend." I said softly.</p> <p>"I've always had you. I was a friend, and you always would be a friend." She said to me. "Besides, you have a great family and you never once went back and forth between them. They were the most accepting of anyone who came back home. I never went back into your life."</p> <p>"It's just that..." I started. Her question took me by surprise. I was about to answer her, with all of her advice. She wanted me to try to live my life, and if I thought I could, I could also help her in ways she couldn't.</p> <p>"I'll ask you one more time, please." She replied in a tone of voice that I could not place. When she said "One" I did.</p> <p>"This one. You have to be absolutely certain. It's the only time you can trust me. That is all the more important to you." I finished as I turned around to join her at the waterfall.</p> <p>"I know you're probably scared, but I need to trust you. I don't want it." I told her honestly.</p> <p>"Okay." Her reply came out as a whisper. I had known what she meant to say, but I didn't think she was going to say it. I wasn't going to push it. "I'll be right there."</p> <p>"Okay, I'll be there." I said a little more forcefully. She nodded and walked towards me with a confident stride. "I need to make sure you're ready for this." She said to me once we were both standing on the bank of the stream.</p> <p>"This is going to be the hardest part. We're going to hike for a little while as well." I told her. We began walking out of the woods heading towards this little stream in the late afternoon sun.
