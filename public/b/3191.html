You could see the sides of his thigh as the skirt came down. I asked "where did u get this shirt on?" I couldn't believe I said the word "this". I tried to explain and he said "no need to be silly. I bought this for you."</p> <p>Looking at him, he leaned towards me and I opened my lips to kiss him, but he turned him back. I turned away again and he pulled me in again. I felt his arms go around me pulling me against him. I couldn't help myself. It felt so right. It's almost like being with another person! I never imagined I could be with another woman, just like this man. I had never felt it before. It only felt right and he kept kissing me.</p> <p>I moved one hand from his shoulder to his shoulder to try to keep it there but he pulled me in tightly. He kissed me all the way to my lip and he tasted so good. I was getting the same feeling I had the other night, his lips on mine. As he pulled me in closer, his other hand left my hip to pull the strap of my dress to the side to expose my breast to him.</p> <p>I leaned into him, his hand resting on my back, as he brought his lips to my ear. He gently blew on my ear, and with his hand on my back, he pulled me in tight.</p> <p>I could feel the warmth of his breath on me, and I felt so safe with him. I knew this would be the moment I wanted, the moment I thought about for years was about to happen. His hand had left my back and it slid down to my butt to pull me in tight. He leaned my on his shoulder, my other hand still on his back. "I am so wet." He whispered to me. "You are really getting into this." Looking up at the stars, he pulled his hand away from my butt and rubbed his finger on one of my butt cheeks. Looking round me, he kissed my forehead, and pulled me into his arms again.</p> <p>I wrapped my arm around his neck and hugged him hard. "This is so wild, don't stop." He whispered to me. As I kissed his neck and kissed his cheek, I felt his fingers begin exploring my wetness. They felt so warm. I felt it seep out, and slide into my panties to be met with his hand. He began to rub me as he pulled my panties out of the way and I felt his hand against my lips a moment before his finger entered me. I moaned his name as he fingered me.</p> <p>I couldn't believe I had let a man I had only just meet take me in. But as I started to become more turned on, he had removed his hand from my panties with his fingertip, and with his other hand he began to slip it into his trousers. As his fingers slipped between my lips and onto my clit, I felt the ting of his cock as it brushed my lips. And he held it there against me to let me have it. I let my body be opened up to him and I felt nothing but his hardness and my own fingers, stroking it.</p> <p>His fingers continued to touch me, touching my clit and moving closer. I felt his fingers slide inside me and then enter. My legs spread apart, I was able to feel his hardness against me, his finger pressing against my lips. After all, the other night, he had made his cock inside me. His finger was moving in me, moving inside me, and I was so turned on. Not only could I feel his hardness inside me, but I could feel his tongue on my breast or his lips on mine as he sucked my nipple. I was getting to the point where I could no longer control myself and started to hump his finger. "I am going to cum, take me in. I need to be inside of you." He said in my ear. He put his finger back inside me, and began to move his hips back and forth. It felt so good. So right. I could feel him against me at the same time he said it, he was inside of me, but I couldn't feel his cock inside me. Oh God this feels so right!</p> <p>I felt his body stiffen and he pushed against me at the knees. It felt so good, and I pressed against him as if to encourage him to cum inside of me. I couldn't wait any longer. I pushed him up against the wall, lifted my legs, moved forward to the floor and slid him inside me. With him pressed into my pussy, I felt his cock inside of me, it was so big, and yet it felt so right. It felt as if my whole body was being turned around asâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
