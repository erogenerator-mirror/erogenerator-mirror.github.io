He began to wonder who the other man was and what kind of a relationship this was. The look of horror on his face must have told her that he knew she was a sub-master and that she was about to be used by another man. He reached out his hand and brought it to the side of her face. He saw the fear in her eyes as he lightly ran his fingers over her cheek. It was clear to him that she had never expected this.</p> <p>The realization of what he had just done scared him for what seemed like the hundred first time he had just told people they'd become a slave, even if it was to strangers. It was the fear of the unknown that scared him so much. He put his left hand gently on the middle of her cheek and pulled her face towards him. She looked at him and her eyes were almost pleading.</p> <p>“Open your mouth,” he whispered to her as he lifted up his face to hers. Their lips met and he pulled her closer to him. His hand gently pushed her back, she let him. Her mouth opened and he began to kiss her. She was trembling, almost convulsing with the thought of this man fucking her. The way she reacted was almost too much. As they kissed, he began to gently thrust his hips again and slid his hand behind hers, feeling her warm body. He felt the wetness of her pussy and he thought for sure he could make her cum.</p> <p>His hand worked its way back down to her ass. He pulled them apart, slowly pushing his middle finger between the tight ring of her pussy and into her ass. She moaned as she felt it begin to press into her ass slowly. Her mouth let go of him completely and she leaned forward, arching her back as the finger went deeper into her body. Her mouth closed around his neck again and he felt her tongue push into his neck as if to demand that he continue. He continued to push his finger in and out of her pussy slowly, slowly she began to breathe much more heavily as his finger slid deeper into the tightness. His free hand left her breast and he began to gently roll her hardened nipple, pulling it into his mouth.</p> <p>She began to moan harder as his fingers moved deeper inside her and then, as he felt her body start to quiver he reached between them and took his hand away. She didn't make any move to stop him, as his hand was moving her nipples to hard points. He felt her hips pushing back towards him and he continued to move his finger in and out of her body as her body thrashed in passion. He looked down at the woman who was totally helpless as he slowly moved his finger in and out of her body. Her body went through an entire new wave of emotions as her pussy gripped him as he pulled his fingers from her body.</p> <p>“I’ll be good as new in a few minutes,” he said, “it’s all that’s needed now for me to start working on you.”</p> <p>As he spoke, he moved his finger up towards her ass, gently pushing it into the tight ring of her ass. Her body jerked as more and more of her body started to relax. He continued to press his finger into her ass slowly with each insertion, making sure he was going further than just his middle finger. His cock was beginning to harden in his pants, more as he watched than in his mind, as the woman he was making love to spread her legs while he fucked her ass.</p> <p>He slowly moved his finger out of her ass and began fingering her pussy. She was making sounds, but he was focused on himself, it seemed, as he was enjoying her body. She stopped breathing slightly again as he pulled his finger from her pussy and moved his finger back down to her ass. He watched as she pushed back against his finger, lifting herself once again in to his hand.</p> <p>“Now, you know you can use your fingers to get yourself off,” he said as he worked over her hard clit with one finger. He moved it up over her clit, up to her pussy hole. He felt it start to yield as his finger got into her tight hole again, as the pressure of the blood in her body began to drive her towards a climax. She began to shudder from her head to her feet and almost pulled his hand away from her. Her mouth hung open as she began to moan loudly. He brought his finger up to his mouth and licked at the finger thoroughly before placing it back down between her legs again.</p> <p>He removed his hand so quickly that it hurt. It was like he had just put it in a new position to fuck her pussy hard now. He slid one knee up to his knee and hooked her leg up over his shoulder. She began to move—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
