Her voice was hoarse with excitement. "Well, okay, that was a stupid thing to do for me, was it? But look, it was really fucking hot, you know that?"</p> <p>"Me too," I answered, smiling at her mischievously. Then I glanced at the clock, seeing that it was three o'clock already and wondering how I could delay getting to her bed to have sex with her. "Well, I'd better go shower up and change."</p> <p>"Okay, I'll see you in the kitchen," she told the shower curtain on, then turned and gave me a hug and a kiss right on my cheek and walked away and closed the door to the bathroom and shut off the lights so that we could get out.</p> <p>"God, that was fucking hot" I thought to myself as I went back up to my room to undress and pick up the DVD case we had bought to surprise her at a late dinner and set it on my bedside table. I was sitting on the bed and I immediately grabbed the laptop and was surfing away on Yahoo. Looking at my favorite webcam site on the laptop, I knew that I was going to get to see her in several positions while she fingered herself. My heart was pounding as I thought how hot that would be. And to make things worse, while there were two people watching, I was now actively viewing her panties on the website and it was obvious to even myself that she was wearing no panties. "Oh God," I thought to myself. "I'm doing exactly what I'm told for the next two months."</p> <p>The next three months were a blur of sexual excitement, both because of her being in my neighborhood, and because in the end, when we made love we did nothing but talk, laugh, and even masturbate. She was so hot, so pretty and all of her sexy outfits had a new look and when I mentioned them to her in some of her stories, she had a big, shit-eating grin on her face. For the first time that I knew, I began getting aroused at the thought of her naked in front of me the next day. Even thinking about her naked body was making me harder than I could ever remember, and I didn't even realize how I felt about it until she walked in on me while I was watching a porn movie. She told me she had found it interesting that I was interested in the girl on girl sex, but she really seemed to enjoy watching me. I'm sure she was feeling the same way.</p> <p>I was just about ready to explode when she asked me if I had got the DVD player built into my bedside table and I told her that I did but that, "if I could watch it in the morning, I would be ready for it in the afternoon." She said that was fine and that she would love to have the best sex of her life with me. She made a face and said, "That's no fun, is it?" I told her that she was just being nice and I was just not interested in the idea of us getting together for sex. Not really, not even that, but it felt good to say so. So she made me get my laptop and she left my room and walked naked behind my bed.</p> <p>I just stood there in the doorway as a vision of loveliness, a vision worth a lot of fantasies, was staring at me. She was really beautiful. Her legs were spread wide, her pubic hair was trimmed neatly and her big round ass was sticking up. She was wearing a thin negligee with the hem tucked up underneath it and the negligee's material was stretched between her breasts. That's when she surprised me. In fact, right then it just seemed like she wanted to show off her body because of what she had in mind for me.</p> <p>She was wearing a silk-trimmed silk robe that barely covered her ass as she sat down on the end of my bed and, when her hands came around to my waist and began to undress me, I felt myself going insane. In fact I couldn't have imagined that she would do anything like that. She started by kissing me on my lips and neck while sliding her hand down and over my flat stomach and up over my dick. When her hand finally reached all the way around to the front of my underwear and she felt my dick, I felt as though I was going to cum if she touched me there for very long. Her hand was magic and to no doubt, she had me completely aroused just from the thought of kissing me. Her hand moved down and I felt it sliding into my pubic hair, first in just a little bit and then her finger pushed into my pussy. It felt like heaven.</p> <p>My body was tingling with desire and desire and with every second that I stared into her eyes, I felt that rush of wanting and desire, thatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
