"Well, good night."</p> <p>"Good night, too." I turned from her and closed the door, walking down the hall to her bedroom without looking back.</p> <p>I turned around and headed into the bathroom, turning the water in the shower. After turning the shower on a few times before rinsing my hair again, I picked up the paper towel that I'd left on the sink and started drying my hair.</p> <p>"Do you have work tomorrow?" I asked.</p> <p>"Sure. I'm meeting a friend who's going to London and I thought I'd surprise her and maybe let her come to see the new store I was going to. I'm actually doing a bit of laundry out back, so you can get the rest of the day off. Maybe you should be able to grab some breakfast and then go."</p> <p>I smiled at her. "Well, the house phone works normally, so I might just get a bit of breakfast, since I was sort of wondering where you were."</p> <p>"I'm just finishing up some chores, and I told Tina that I'd be home tonight at 7 if that was okay with her." She stood up, starting the shower. "Can you give me an extra hour of fun with me? I'm really tired after spending all that time just thinking about your cock sliding in and out of me. I'd love to do this, really."</p> <p>I didn't think I'd tell her about the shower and what that meant, but I was pretty sure I wouldn't have to worry about the rest of the day at all. I finished my shower and then grabbed a towel and dried my hair. I slipped on my robe and followed her out into the kitchen.</p> <p>"Hi, honey. Let's eat something, I'm hungry."</p> <p>"I'll be down in a few. I was just preparing us a little breakfast in bed."</p> <p>She followed me down the hallway to the kitchen. "Are you sure you don't mind me coming with you? I've already seen the way you look in your clothes, and I'd really appreciate it if you didn't try to get naked on the kitchen floor all the time."</p> <p>"No, it's not a big deal. I'm not trying to do anything without you." I reached out and put my hand on her waist and started to run my hands up her sides. She took the other arm and pulled me onto her, kissing me hard and long. "I never even thought that we would do anything that bad, but since you don't like the taste of it right, I'm going to taste it a little before I get you naked."</p> <p>I had to laugh as she started tugging at the knot in my robe, which fell open a little. She broke the kiss and ran her fingers through the hair on my chest. I lifted her up, kissing her again before she lowered her onto a kitchen counter. I unbuttoned her robe, and slid it down her body. She leaned forward slightly, putting her bare feet flat on the counter and allowing me unfettered access to her pussy. Her lips were swollen with excitement as I moved my tongue from her clit to her entrance and then back; starting slowly, then increasing the pressure.</p> <p>I slid a finger inside her and then back out. "Is this okay?" I asked, still working her pussy.</p> <p>"Oh, god, yes. Don't stop, John, give it to me." I took her hips and started to lower her onto my lap. I slid easily inside her and started to move it in and out and she cried out. "Fuck me, John. I want you like this forever." It was a statement more than a question.</p> <p>I started rubbing her clit with my thumb as I kept it pressed inside her. I could feel how wet she had gotten and I could feel how much she wanted it all. I didn't want to come as quickly as I was going, but I wanted her to have an orgasm. In seconds she was moaning and crying as the waves rolled over her. "Oh my god," she said, pulling at my hair, "John, John, I'm coming." I kept stroking her as her whole body went rigid.</p> <p>"Wow!" I smiled into her pussy as she finished coming. "If you were a live one, I'd go up there with you right now."</p> <p>She smiled, then pulled my head back to kiss me. "I'm sorry, you're right. I really just wish that it wasn't so embarrassing to say you're a jerk like you've been."</p> <p>"It's okay. Now, eat something that you've never had before. Your mouth and tongue are like steel." I took my finger and started to move it around inside of herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
