It was a long, wordless, desperate gasp as his cock thrust up towards her face, and she couldn't resist sliding one of her hands down from his hip to capture it and bring it up to squeeze his balls. Her lips parted, and she opened up even further to take him in fully in her mouth.</p> <p>He moaned softly. He didn't know how long he'd been holding back -- he'd barely even stopped moving, a minute of that, then an eternity of this, if he had that much more stamina left.</p> <p>Her lips tightened. He was going to say something, just to say yes, and then go at it again. But he couldn't. He couldn't. She kept saying the words, the words of encouragement. She was just looking up at him, with her eyes staring back at him.</p> <p>He looked down at her, looking for permission. His eyes met hers again.</p> <p>No, wait, there's no going back. He didn't have to say it again. She was going to do it. She was going to swallow him. He'd wanted to say it once, but couldn't resist. Her lips pressed against the base and she started to push her face back, all but engulfing him again.</p> <p>He'd been so close, that it felt so good to have her mouth surrounding his cock before he really couldn't take it any more. She took him out for an instant and started to work her way down his length. She went so far down his length. He'd tried to go slow, but couldn't. Then, when he couldn't even begin to hope, he tried pushing away, trying to thrust back into her mouth and throat.</p> <p>He felt himself slipping away, sliding down her throat, disappearing into her mouth, and his hands clenched as if to hold himself in place as she slid past him at her own speed. She took him, and he felt her mouth move down the shaft, past the base and past the tip before she pushed all the way back up again.</p> <p>She took him in again, so full of cock, and he started to go crazy. He felt her lips start to rub around just above the base, feeling that little brush of her tongue against the head of his cock. "Oh fuck! Take me, please take me!" He tried to go slow, but couldn't. He felt her lips touch around the rim of his cock, and she slid down it so slowly that nothing but his head was inside, her lips squeezing around him, pushing every inch of him in.</p> <p>He shuddered. She pushed him back up, forcing him to sit down on the grass in mid-moan. She took him in again, and he felt himself slipping all the way back, but she stayed where she was, her mouth sliding over his cock, her hands gripping his thighs. He moaned, felt himself slip down into her mouth again until his balls touched her chin. She slid her mouth back up his length and slowly started to back off, working her way back up again. He was lost in the waves of desire, the tingling of a desire he'd never felt until this moment.</p> <p>She was right where he wanted her. She felt the tingle and slide of his cock, and she slid back down his length again, her lips kissing his head while her hands stroked his shaft. He slid his hands to her sides, pulled her closer, but she kept him in her mouth, the tingling in her lips continuing as she started to work her way back up his cock.</p> <p>Her mouth was hot and wet around him, her hands working up and down his shaft, pulling at him, stroking him. She bobbed her head in counterpoint to her hand, stroking him faster and faster. He felt it building inside him, building, building. He looked down at her as he looked down at her, eyes closed, and he swore he could see the light in her eyes, the bright smile that was in her eyes. Her tongue moved out to lick at his base while she slid his cock in and out a few more times. He felt his balls starting to tighten and knew he was coming in her mouth. She didn't stop. She didn't pause.</p> <p>He felt himself going over the edge, and the feeling rushed up from his stomach to the tip of his cock, making his head tingle with the rush of blood and hot, burning, hot lust. He came as hard as he ever had.</p> <p>As he fell back onto the ground, she stood up. She had a big grin. He was going to love the way she felt when it was like this, right there in the middle of the roadâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
