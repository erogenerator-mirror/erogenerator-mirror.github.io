She couldn't finish as he lifted her up and lay her down gently and turned her around once again, lying down with his legs over hers.</p> <p>She could feel his hard cock nestled against her stomach and was very aware of how he was pressing ever closer to her, his hands reaching out to cup her breasts again, but he didn't touch her there instead instead, his lips moving to kiss her neck, feeling the heat rise from her body.</p> <p>"No," she whispered, "it's been...different..."</p> <p>"No but it really is," he said as the kiss was cut off as he grabbed her hips and plunged into her, and, at last, she was moaning again.</p> <p>"I don't understand you," she sighed her words between kisses.</p> <p>'It's simple," he murmured into her neck.</p> <p>"But you didn't...you didn't have any cock," she murmured as he began to thrust in and out of her body, and she knew that was a mistake, "I could feel you...inside me," she said as she closed her eyes.</p> <p>"I wanted you," he whispered to her, holding onto her again as he began to drive his long hard cock deeper and deeper, until he could feel his own wetness on the head of his shaft.</p> <p>She felt it on her legs as he wrapped his arms around her and pressed himself fully against her, his body pushing against her and she felt his hard cock as he thrust himself with every thrust. He had his head thrown back and his eyes closed as his movements became more frantic, and as he thrust himself deep into her, she reached her own peak and held onto him, grinding her hips with his and feeling him grow even harder inside her.</p> <p>"Yes...yes!" she moaned, and soon her pussy was soaking in sticky cum.</p> <p>A second orgasm was about to hit her, and he had no intention of missing it, pounding into her with full force.</p> <p>"Ugh!" she groaned, and he was quickly followed by the last few spurts of his warm cum, pressing against her clit.</p> <p>Then he collapsed onto her, holding himself still inside her as he kissed the back of her neck and rested gently as she felt him begin to shrink inside of her then.</p> <p>"Fuck," she whispered into his neck and he turned her around, pulling her to him as he laid her down.</p> <p>They cuddled and caressed each other as the kiss had just started, and then he began, pressing into her gently with one long, strong thrust.</p> <p>"I'm so sorry," she whispered as he fucked her.</p> <p>"No that doesn't matter," he replied with a smile and rolled himself over, pressing into her.</p> <p>* * * * * * * *</p> <p>"I never thought you would ever let me," he murmured, his eyes still closed. "Didn't mean anything."</p> <p>"But you've always said you were sorry, and now you are...I'm sorry," she answered as he rolled her onto her back and slowly began sinking into her again at the same time, making his weight press against her and take his position to drive as deep as it could.</p> <p>"Oh...don't be sorry," he murmured. "It will make things better for both of us."</p> <p>"I love you so much...please don't ever leave me."</p> <p>"I'll always want you," he murmured, but he didn't finish the sentence.</p> <p>"I love you too..." she murmured as his hard cock slid into her, again just as deeply as before, and he held her tightly, lifting her up and falling her back down on his cock, the pleasure so intense in itself.</p> <p>"Now let me feel you inside me," he said as they rolled onto their sides, both breathing deeply as he slowly moved inside her, the feeling of his cock inside her so different and so warm and alive.</p> <p>"It's not really possible, I know," she murmured as he held her.</p> <p>"But you feel so good," he answered as his hands slid up her breasts and cupped them once more. "I love feeling you," he said as they slowly stroked themselves, feeling her heart beating faster as her own rose from the same rhythm.</p> <p>"I'm sorry I didn't think..."</p> <p>"Don't be," he said and kissed her. "I feel great and I'll try to get you back the next time we see eachâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
