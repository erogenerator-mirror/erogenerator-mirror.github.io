We will just be in here for a while.”</p> <p>“Well, I’m kind of hungry.” I admitted. But I made room for her in bed, she was lying on her stomach. I turned on the bedside lamp and placed her on her side, facing her left side. We were both naked.</p> <p>“It’s nice to be out.” She laughed as this was her first time. She turned to me, “You don’t have to get up if you want me.” She moved her left hand to the small of my back as her right held my now very erect cock. She moved her lips to my neck and kissed me, her tongue found mine and we shared our first kiss. I could feel the heat of her body on mine, and could feel the heat from her breasts as she hovered over my body. Slowly she moved her left hand to my cock and moved it along the shaft, feeling how hard I was for her.</p> <p>“You like that, don’t you?” She asked me.</p> <p>“I’m not sure if I want to continue this, I like being with you.”</p> <p>“Neither are we going to continue, but don’t worry, we are just starting.” She rolled over on her stomach and spread her legs invitingly. She leaned forward and put her hands on her knees as she opened her legs. Her beautiful ass was right in my face, as if inviting me in. I took the small of her back in both hands and ran the tips of my fingers up and up, over the tight muscles of her ass and between her thighs. She was very sexy. I had to look away as I got closer and closer to her crack, to get a good look.</p> <p>But I couldn’t. I had to see what was to come. I placed my left hand next to her spine and the fingers that had been caressing her back as if would lead to her wet pussy. So far I couldn’t see a thing. I felt her ass with both my hands, and then I moved my finger up to her wet pussy, feeling her outer lips as she opened slightly, and slightly spread. This was going to be a quick fuck. I slid my finger gently, but firmly, up and down, in and out, over her clit until she was writhing from pleasure. Then I pulled away, and she turned all the way on her stomach. I bent over to kiss her neck, as she laid there completely exposed.</p> <p>“This is crazy,” she said, “this is the hottest thing I have ever been with.”</p> <p>“It’s because you’re new to sex.” I said, reaching back to caress her ass. She moaned with a smile on her face. I bent down and kissed the back of her shoulders before sliding into her. The full length of my dick entered her, filling both our minds with pleasure as we began to thrust our bodies together. She moved her hips upward to meet mine as we began a powerful motion. We were soon in a rhythm that neither of us knew we had entered by the sounds of the waves crashing on the water. My left hand moved to her left ass cheek, and my right began to kneed her ass cheek as we drove into each other, we met each of our own pace.</p> <p>We were both completely lost in this new and wondrous sensation. I felt as if I would cum at any moment. “I can't hold off any longer,” I said, pulling my dick out and driving it back into her. I continued to kiss her neck, and then her breasts, first one then the other. I could feel a taut tension rising in her body as I drove my cock into her. After a minute or so the tension got stronger and we both became more frantic. We were so turned on that we couldn’t contain ourselves. Sweat was running off our bodies. The air rushing back around us mingled with our cries of pleasure. We were so close that a moment ago, we would have fucked, and had even gone as far as we had. But now, we were close to exploding.</p> <p>“I’m going to cum, I’m going to cum!” We both gasped for air, our orgasms now starting to rip into us like lightning. We were both overcome with the feelings of ecstasy. I felt her pussy clench against mine and knew that she had to let go.</p> <p>“I—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
