It is definitely the most perfect combination of flavors and taste. I've never tasted anything quite like it before."</p> <p>"Well then, now that you have tasted me, let us start over." With that she stood up and removed her shorts, letting them drop from her body. She left them on the counter, but the way she stood caused them to drop back down.</p> <p>"It wouldn't go down without some attention. And besides that's where you really want to have it."</p> <p>"You can be that way, boss," I said. I moved over to the refrigerator and grabbed two beers. I moved back over to Julie's, took off my clothes and sat down on the couch to sit down to wait for her to come back from the bathroom. Half an hour later, Julie came around the corner dressed in jeans and a white shirt. She had put on her black stiletto boots and black stilettos, which put her in line nicely for me.</p> <p>"Well, I had a little bit of a surprise for you," she said as she handed me the beers and sat down next to me.</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"I just had a little something." With that she placed her hand on the back of my head, pulled my head down to her leg and gave me a long kiss.</p> <p>"You're not going anywhere," she whispered in my ear. She then turned to where I was sitting on the couch. With a devilish grin on her face she grabbed my hand and pulled it up her body, leaving a wet trail of our juices down her thigh. I was so surprised to feel so much wetness. She lifted my finger to her lips and licked up the wetness and smiled wickedly.</p> <p>"Hmm, delicious," she said. "What would you like to do now?"</p> <p>"Well, you know you were going to let me go upstairs," I said. "And then we'd have a few things to talk about."</p> <p>"Oh, but I liked it," she said.</p> <p>"Well, we can leave now. You just have to tell me what you want to happen," I said.</p> <p>"Well, I don't have this all morning to work with," she said mischievously. "I just want us to be totally honest."</p> <p>She didn't let go of my hand and slid her fingers into her panties. "Hmm, you really enjoy this don't you."</p> <p>"Well, yes, I am. But I wouldn't really like it if you didn't," I said. "You're an awesome lay." Julie smiled and raised her eyebrows, her face flushed. "So, we have to figure out a way to take our relationship one step at a time," she said.</p> <p>"I think it would be very interesting, isn't it," I said.</p> <p>"I agree, I think so. I'm just a little nervous right now."</p> <p>I laughed. "You were saying something about being ready for me."</p> <p>"Yes," she said. "Now let's relax and enjoy the ride."</p> <p>Her voice was a little different, but that made both of us shiver just a little bit. "That's a promise," she said, her voice barely audible.</p> <p>The ride started and we began. Julie had me sit on the sofa and she straddled my lap, facing away from me. She took my hands and placed them at the top of her thighs, letting my hands explore her, even when we were so far apart. At first she just stroked my upper arms. I think that only made her even more sexually aroused and I was about to tell her that I was going to be her husband or something, when she spoke to me.</p> <p>"I love you," she said, after taking her hand from my lower arms. "I've wanted this for too long. I just couldn't stop asking myself if you weren't really my husband or my husband."</p> <p>It was the first time she had actually said anything that wasn't sexy. "I meant it, too. When we got married it was all I really cared about. I even tried to get in your pants to give you a blowjob or something like that. The fact that I didn't give you the time of day and it was my idea kept me feeling pretty safe."</p> <p>"You know, I thought the same thing. I know you have been trying to be my boss as of late but, well, you obviously seem pretty desperate to put pressure on me."</p> <p>"Yeah," she said softly, "I can tell."</p> <p>"Yeah, I'm pretty desperate. You seem to know so much about it."</p> <p>"Well, I was in love with Julie, but she was just all mine. I love her a lot more than I ever lovedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
