"Have fun and get settled in the office."</p> <p>With that I walked out and headed over to the bar where our drinks were waiting. I walked behind the bar.</p> <p>She looked around and saw me. "What do we have." She said to me.</p> <p>"Shaking our heads 'no'," I answered. "We're not allowed to wear our outfits for an event. And I wanted to show off the goods."</p> <p>She looked at me, and smiled. "I'd be glad to take that to the next level." She picked up two tall glasses off the bar and drained them. She picked a half-full glass and raised it up to her lips again. "Cheers," she said and took a deep swallow of the drink. She paused for a moment, and sipped her drink. The glass still tasted a bit weird.</p> <p>"Ahem... are you feeling better?" she asked.</p> <p>"A little," I said. "I'll have another beer and get another glass, then we'll call it a night. But I want to dance a little more before we head back. I want to dance to the music while we dance, but if you're up for it, we'll go to mine, if that's alright?" I said.</p> <p>She looked at me in the mirror for a moment and smiled. "I agree with your reasoning about the 'ourselves."</p> <p>"I can't agree with your whole mindset about the 'ourselves." I replied. "But let's continue with our drinks. Then I have my own dance. Besides, I'm a dancer. I'm better than you at this type of activity, so let's continue."</p> <p>She looked at me for a moment, then picked up a half empty glass. She took a sip and handed it back to me. I reached out and poured ourselves a drink. She grabbed the empty glass and downed it in one swallow. "What did you do with that?" she asked.</p> <p>"Let me show you the first aid kit." I handed a small bag to her.</p> <p>She opened it and took out several of the items. There weren't much in the kit, so she was more than happy to try things out. After a few minutes of work, she was ready. She opened an entire bottle of water. I didn't know what she did with hers, but she didn't seem to mind.</p> <p>"So, um..." she started. "I just need to refill one of the glasses. Do you mind if I have the same with mine, though?"</p> <p>"No, not at all," I told her. "Go ahead and refill one of them."</p> <p>She took both. "How does one refuge a large glass of water?" I asked.</p> <p>"Oh, I'm kidding, I just need to refill it."</p> <p>I reached over and handed her the glass. "You can use any of the bottles. I'll refill yours anyway."</p> <p>She smiled at me with her sparkling green eyes. "You're the best."</p> <p>I looked around the bar and saw no one I wanted to sit and talk too. She smiled at me again, then made her way back out where we had been sitting.</p> <p>"Can we dance now?" she asked when we returned. I got up. The cold bar-bar didn't take my eyes off her as she moved to the CD player. We danced.</p> <p>The music filled the room. We moved toward the dance floor, only she kept her feet from touching the floor. She placed one leg on my lap, which gave me some wonderful friction to rub up and down my crotch. It didn't take her long to find my hardon, and she reached around me and stroked it. I moved my arms around her and squeezed her bare backside. This sent delightful waves of pleasure up into my neck to my groin. She slowly backed up and moved around our group of friends, pressing against our bodies. I reached out and massaged her breasts while rubbing her ass.</p> <p>She leaned into kiss me; "I want to see everything."</p> <p>She took her left hand and brought it up to the top of my shirt. She gently rubbed my nipples from underneath. Then she took one into her mouth. She worked on it gently with her mouth. I moved my hands down her back and down to her ass. I caressed her butt and kneaded both cheeks. She put one leg up on mine.</p> <p>The song was about to end; the band stopped, and the floor show started. They turned the music up. When we got to the chorus I took her hand, and guided it to my cock.</p> <p>The song ended. The lights dimmed. We were quietâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
