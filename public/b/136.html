"That was what you thought was a sisterly thing. Maybe I should let you borrow my car until I get my head around this whole thing. It will be nice to get home, take a long bath, and drive all the way back home feeling the breeze in the backseat. There're lots of places to go and a lot of places that are private."</p> <p>"You're right, dear, it was our family that wanted to go all the way and this was it."</p> <p>"Oh? I think this is where we're going, right? We're going to a family gathering in celebration of the completion of our relationship."</p> <p>"No kidding. Well, there is. The reception that you're about to attend is the main event, and by invitation from the partners I've arranged for us to come to an open house afterward to eat and to see new members of my family. And it's all going to be going well. We are going to celebrate with each other. You know me, and I am going to do my best to help you make it through."</p> <p>"Of course you could, dear. That's right dear. You're going to give me lots of great help to raise you."</p> <p>"Well, that's just great for me. I'm glad you can make it; I'm sure I can do it."</p> <p>"And you'll give me all the support I need." She kissed me, very briefly, and they began. After dinner, during which we were quiet and talking, I asked, "Should we get you cleaned up? I have some of the cleanest things I can get you. When you're done I'd like some wine and perhaps some water to refresh your mood."</p> <p>"I'd love to get all of that and some more. Thank you for trying."</p> <p>She began to dress. I had no idea how she planned on doing that. I wasn't sure she was aware of her own plans and it surprised me to see her look at what I had just done. I looked at her and told her, "Oh, it was just a spur of the moment thing; I wanted to be part of some really memorable event. My whole experience was in your lap."</p> <p>"I hope you're still excited about the event tomorrow. You're so much fun...I just hope we can have a chance to see all the women we've been with."</p> <p>"I'm certainly eager, dear. But, what are I supposed to wear?"</p> <p>She laughed before she dressed with me. She had a white blouse, the kind where the buttons come down all the way to a button and the hemline is just that - short. "Well, you can wear this."</p> <p>"Do you have something in mind?" I asked.</p> <p>She laughed again and said, "Oh yes. I've been wondering how you would go about fitting me, what it might be like. I'm really nervous about it; you've already made me a convert, haven't you?"</p> <p>"Of course I do. You're absolutely beautiful. I don't know if I could do it without you."</p> <p>"That's my girl. I'd love to help you, but I can't go for one dance tonight. Besides, I wouldn't want to take advantage of you with nothing on."</p> <p>"It gets worse and worse, dear. I know I look really good and I'm not just saying this because I love it. I can't tell you how much it means to me. I love the attention you give me too, not my sister, not your friend."</p> <p>She laughed again and said, "You're right of course. But I guess that's a little different here. You're not the only one who's noticed me. In fact, the others who have noticed me have even caught me glancing over at you when you come near."</p> <p>"I see," I said. "What do they do with you, that you're even doing this? If I might say, you're the reason why you're doing all this to me. I'm not sure I can say what I want to say at all."</p> <p>She pulled me close to her and put her arms around my neck. She kissed me softly and said, "All three of us are coming to the party tomorrow to celebrate our friendship. We're going to the party, in my mind. It will be about me, me, me. I know it will be. We all will. And I have the keys to the house. And if or for if we all go, I'm more than willing to do whatever it is you'd rather." I was dumbstruck. "All we'll just have to do is kiss each other, that's all," I said. "If you're sure that's what you want," Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
