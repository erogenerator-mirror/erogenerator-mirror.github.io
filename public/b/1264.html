I wish. You could help me. How about if I give you the same treatment as you give to me, or if you'd rather not..." I said, as I trailed off just a little bit.</p> <p>"What the heck are you talking about!" she insisted, trying to pull me along.</p> <p>"You can't help me. I can't help you. I love you," I replied, feeling guilty, but feeling so much more than anything else. After all, I still believed she loved me, and it was only natural that I wanted the same treatment.</p> <p>"You...you don't love me," she said, as she pushed me out of the way and looked down at her.</p> <p>"No way! I just thought you were different. I have seen you before. Remember. It's all we are, and that makes it different. You are different because you love me, and because you know how to please me...or so help me with that. I want you so much. I want to be with you."</p> <p>I looked up from the floor, but before I could say anything, she wrapped me in her arms and pulled me closer to her. I couldn't resist her, even if someone was watching. She pressed her lips to mine, and I gave in. It was so sweet, so wonderful. I loved her and I'd waited so long for this day.</p> <p>We kissed slowly and lovingly for about a minute or two before breaking apart. I stepped back to let her take my shirt off, leaving me with only my little black thong. She slipped it on and pulled on her own jeans, before pulling me into her arms. Slowly, we made our way upstairs, and up the stairs. I was nervous at first, but she finally relented, and we moved directly into her parent's bedroom. I stopped and looked at the bed. It was huge. It was made up of dark blue and white, and the bed was covered with a brown coverlet from the sheets to the top.</p> <p>She took the coverlet from me, placing it on the bed before closing the door. I climbed onto the bed and she slid in next to me, snuggling close. With our hands already linked, our lips found each other again, and our kissing grew even more passionate.</p> <p>She undid the buttons of my shirt so that I could let the shirt fall to the side, revealing my pale skin. She slipped her hands inside my shirt, rubbing my bare chest. I undid the clasp on her jeans, and then pulled her in to me. Her lips were all over my neck, my cheek and across my lips.</p> <p>"Suck it, please," she demanded, and I moved to take control, moving my mouth off hers and trailing it down her chin.</p> <p>"Suck it," I whispered, trailing my fingers up over her neck and down to her shoulder. The sensation of the soft skin of her shoulder reminded me of where I had just licked a baby's tongue, even though she was no longer even conscious. I continued to trail my fingertips along her skin, up her jaw and down to her shoulder.</p> <p>She groaned from around my lips as she finally came to life again, and she looked at me with a questioning look as I kissed across her cheek to her eyes. She smiled down at me again, and took one of my hands in her own before placing it back on her shoulder.</p> <p>I put my hand on her shoulder with care, and she pulled my lips back to mine as she wrapped her arms around me and pulled my body towards her, laying me back onto the bed. I moaned into her. She pulled her lips from mine, and looked down at me, and her eyes were filled with love and arousal.</p> <p>Her eyes seemed to glaze over with desire, for a moment, before she pulled back.</p> <p>"I love you, honey," she said, and kissed me tenderly. I melted down into the bed, and she fell on top of me.</p> <p>Our kissing had become as frantic as it had become passionate. Her lips were so soft and warm. Her mouth enveloped mine slowly, and seemed to enjoy it almost as much as I did. Our kissing was intense, and had always been, even though she hadn't admitted it to herself in her sleep. Now, we were more able to share the passion she felt for me, and that love was a much deeper passion than mere words.</p> <p>"I want you to fuck me," she whispered softly, the words seeming to come out even more sloppily than they had since the start of our conversation, "I want to feel your hard cock in meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
