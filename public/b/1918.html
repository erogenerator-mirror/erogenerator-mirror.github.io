I started working my tongue at the inside of her pussy. And she pulled me in deeper. We moved faster. The more her body responded, the more I could feel her muscles tightening around me. I moved one of my fingers a little further down. I was sure I touched that button that sent her over the edge to her second orgasm. We kept on making out.</p> <p>We stopped when I felt her hands on my upper back, lifting me back up to kiss her mouth. She had been riding me as soon as my hands came up for air. Her eyes sparkled as they moved from my face, to my eyes, back down, then over to my mouth where they made a slow sucking and swirling motion that sent me over the top.</p> <p>With one last long kiss, and a final one with some tongue, I could take no more. I pulled her up and set her down on me. This time, as I lay there, I could feel myself hardening once again. She felt it too. We both started moving and kissing.</p> <p>"I want to fuck you and not just have sex."</p> <p>"What do you mean?"</p> <p>"I have never done it. But I will. Would you like to put it in me?"</p> <p>She had her fingers in her pussy while she spoke, rubbing her clitoris. I was already at the point of no return. "I don't know."</p> <p>"You don't have to. I have wanted you so much to do this. I want to make you feel special. Would you like that too?"</p> <p>"Yes!"</p> <p>I picked her up and dropped her on me, my dick sliding into her. She was wet, and it took a little wiggling. But my dick was as hard it could ever get. She wrapped her thighs around me and I started moving her hips up and down. She kept the position for a couple of minutes in a slow grinding motion. I kissed her again as I tried to pull her close. She was enjoying it, too. And so was I.</p> <p>I couldn't help myself any more. I wanted to make us both cum. When it felt like I was going to, I lifted her hips up off the bed for a more direct approach. I wanted to make sure I was fully embedded into her. I held her back against me with my arms so she could get some leverage. And I lifted her hips back with my arms and drove her back onto my dick. With both hands, I was holding her legs in my arms as I continued moving.</p> <p>"I am going to cum," she whispered.</p> <p>"Me too."</p> <p>"You ready?"</p> <p>"Let's hurry."</p> <p>She looked at me and said, "I want you to cum in me!"</p> <p>I couldn't really tell what to do. Did I want to cum? That would have to wait. I just wanted to fuck her until I came. And I wanted her to enjoy this. I had no idea. I knew I was about to. I started to lift her up again.</p> <p>"No. Not now. I want it inside me."</p> <p>"No," I said slowly, taking no more time than necessary. I set her at the point of no return. I was going to cum. And I was going to make her cum. I was going to make her feel good. I was going to make her feel that she had me. And I had her.</p> <p>I started fucking her again, moving both of us into unison as if on a string. Each time I had enough room inside her to keep her from pulling my arms out, I lifted her hips up. That drove her closer. When I did, I made sure I was touching all of the right places on the inside of her. That made her orgasm a whole lot sweeter. And she screamed to one more orgasm after another over and over. Finally, we came together. I held her tight and we just kept trying. I didn't want to let her go. I wanted to stay inside of her and never leave her.</p> <p>After the longest time it started to end, I knew that it was going to be a long time. I lifted her hips off of me and I started to roll us over so she was on her back, with both of us on her. She opened her thighs and I went back inside of her pussy.</p> <p>"Fuck me! Fuck me with your dick, hard and fast, please!"</p> <p>I started moving my hips again, and slowly. I didn't speed up. I wasn't going to rush. I wanted her to experience everything.</p> <p>"Yes! Yes!"</p> <p>I was just beginning to get to that stage. I was about to cum at the exact same time. She made sure she opened herself more to meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
