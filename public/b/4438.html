The door finally opened and in walked this stunningly attractive woman, dressed in a skimpy two-piece jumpsuit but with a hood hiding the fact that she was an alien, much less human.</p> <p>The hooded girl slowly moved forward through the crowd and into view, turning all that the attention on her. She was tall, probably in her late thirties, dark-nailed face, brown eyes, and a lovely set of breasts, her skin like a fine porcelain, and she stared right at us, not saying a word. She began to speak, saying something, and I knew something.</p> <p>"Well, hello, I'm Zilara," she said in a flat, melodious, robotic tone that sent shivers up my spine. "Hi, I'm Angel. So glad you could make it," she said as she began unbuttoning the jumpsuit that was around her.</p> <p>"Uh, thanks," was all I could get out before she moved behind me and took my head in her hand.</p> <p>"Now," she said in that melodic voice that made my stomach flip out, "you are going to have to do this to keep yourself quiet.

Zilara was now standing closer to me than I would have thought necessary, her fingers sliding over my skin along with my suit, and I could feel my erection growing in her.</p> <p>"I'm not going to do anything without you, sweetheart," she said, her hands still caressing me, "I have a very special job for you, though," she added with her eyes glancing at Zilara, "And I was really hoping that you would be willing to do this. Please don't be ashamed to do this for me, Zilara. I want to share you with us, I'm very happy to share you with us," she finished with a soft, gentle kiss.</p> <p>As her lips pressed against mine, I felt as if my heart would explode and I could almost taste the inside of Zilara's cheeks.</p> <p>"Now," Angel added, "I'll see you before you leaveâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
