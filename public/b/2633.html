"Well... there's this whole sex film thing and I had this thought about how to get some action out of it..."</p> <p>My head now turned slightly back to the guys. "You mean we're gonna cum in my mouth...?" I was getting off the bed.</p> <p>"Yeah... fuck my mouth," said another one.</p> <p>I smiled and started to move on the bed once more.</p> <p>"Oh yeah... that's it," said a third.</p> <p>I looked up, past my husband, to see him still on the bed. He had taken off his shirt, shorts, and T-shirt himself. His cock was standing straight up at attention, already pointing to the air. He was still fully clothed. I took off my tank-top, but instead of sitting down, I stood up and slid the strap-on strap-on over my wife's head.</p> <p>"There... what do I fuck you in my mouth?," I said to him.</p> <p>"Fuck me," he said.</p> <p>I got up and moved down between his open thighs. I pulled his face down onto my cock. Slowly I shoved my length into his mouth. I pulled it out a few inches and pushed it back in slowly, savoring the taste of his warm mouth as I pumped it in and out of him. I moved down again. The sensation of him on my cock was more amazing than anything I had ever felt. I moved lower on his body while still fucking his mouth. He moaned when he felt my length moving into him.</p> <p>"Ohhhh," I said in the back of my throat. I felt it all on me. A part of me wanted to reach under and grab his cock and feel it, but I wanted to control. I had to be as careful as I could be with this guy at home, so that in return I wouldn't be distracted.</p> <p>I continued stroking in and out. Slowly I increased the speed and angle. I started to feel a warm, wet sensation on my cock that felt amazing, and I was just going to have to keep doing it. I could barely hold it when he pushed his hips up and my cock fully in his mouth. I was about all the way to the root and then I just pushed my hips up and down into him until his lips and chin were pressed tight against me. I had to have his lips on mine as well - if he couldn't go further than that, I had to put some of the effort behind it.</p> <p>"Oh baby... I'm gonna cum... I... gonna cum soon... uhhhh... don't stop..." he said.</p> <p>"Yeah, I don't want to waste this," I said, grabbing his hips and holding onto them with mine. I was going to pull it out of him and let loose all of the spunk we were going to have.</p> <p>I continued to pump him with long, hard, and fast movements. I felt his lips pressing against mine, and the feeling of his tongue playing with mine as he moaned against me. It was the best feeling of all that I could remember having. I had to think about how I was going to control this experience with him.</p> <p>"Cum in my mouth," I said to his lips. "I want you to shoot your hot cum into me."</p> <p>I was surprised at the feeling of his lips against mine, and the hardness in his hips. The feeling was both intense and incredibly erotic, and I felt myself losing control. I was still going strong, taking deep breaths and grinding his hips around. My hands were on his body, taking control of this stranger whose cock I had just fucked. I knew he wanted to explode into her mouth, that it would make him cum hard. But he didn't. I watched his face as he began to shoot his load into my wife's mouth.</p> <p>I continued to fuck him for what seemed like ages, his cock jerking as he took it in his mouth and down his throat, until he had nothing left in him. He pulled back and looked up at me and our eyes met. It was a look I had never given to him. I looked at him, and was amazed. I never thought that we would have this in common. I smiled.</p> <p>"How did you ever do that?" I asked.</p> <p>"I have lots," he said.</p> <p>"Yeah, that is one of the things that I got from my ex," he said.</p> <p>"Well, I think I'm going to like the surprise surprise that you have for me," I said as he slowly got up off of her, standing up on his legs. He looked down at my still hard cockâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
