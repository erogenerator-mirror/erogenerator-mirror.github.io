He wasn't quite sure why the ring had bothered him, but he knew he needed it for certain circumstances, and if he failed to meet his goals, he'd have failed so completely that his entire mission would have been complete.</p> <p>"Of course not. I can't afford to jeopardize the mission, and that's why I'm here. I'm going to be gone for a little while anyway."</p> <p>"If you're going to be gone for a little while, what do you have to lose?" asked Teela. She had a plan. A better question would be, 'How long will I be gone for?'</p> <p>"What'll you wear when I'm gone?" asked Torr. "I can't think of anything that would fit you better than this thing."</p> <p>"You could look at yourself in the full-length mirror there," Tristan suggested. "We're supposed to meet our new boss in the next month or so and watch him interact with a new woman, not in the bar, so you'll look fantastic."</p> <p>"You think so?" asked the Latina. Tristan could see the lust in her eyes. Tristan wondered if she'd really be willing to make love to him in that bar, but the thought seemed too much to risk. He turned to stare at Teela who was smiling at him from across the bar. He could tell that she was in her forties, and that's what interested Torr.</p> <p>"You think so?" asked Teela. "Not sure what you'd be up against, but I think I'd be up for the challenge myself." With that, she grabbed him by the shirt and pulled him towards her. He felt a little awkward doing so with a big grin on his face, but he didn't question her. He quickly pulled Tristan into his chest, which was more comfortable for him, and he pressed one hand down the nape of Tristan's neck so that they could kiss.</p> <p>Teela put her arms around his neck and hugged him tightly. Her breasts poked against his chest and Tristan couldn't help but touch them. He felt her nipples harden against his hand.</p> <p>"I thought you were going to be gone for a time," Tristan said. "I'm in a mood." They both had different feelings for this. Torr's hands were cold against him. Teela's hands were warm.</p> <p>"Maybe I should make an extra effort to wear a little extra tonight," Teela said. "You know, I'm not really into the whole flashing part. I have these little moments in my life, but I think they're just for fun, and I don't want to hurt the guys I work with."</p> <p>"Not really," Tristan said. He didn't feel as though he was intruding.</p> <p>"No, definitely not," Teela said. "I have to admit it...the other girls are right. I don't normally dress like this at work."</p> <p>"I don't mind it," Torr said. He didn't really mean to, but he couldn't keep his eyes or his mind off Teela's outfit. The way she kept dragging him by the collar brought on many conflicting thoughts. Torr had been attracted to her so much that he'd wanted to spend the evening with her before anything more happened. Torr knew that Torr was a better fit for her. The other girls he worked with, he was sure had seen him as something, but he didn't think that Teela felt an attraction as strong as Torr did.</p> <p>"So, where does my little secret go?" Torr asked, pulling away.</p> <p>"I'll tell you if you tell me where you are," Teela said. "But for right now, you don't have to get naked, do you?"</p> <p>"Not now," Tristan said. "The game is over. I think I'd like a good night's sleep."</p> <p>"Well, I might actually," Teela said. "I'm kind of anxious to get out of here. I really need to get dressed."</p> <p>"It's okay," Tristan said. Then he remembered he didn't have a suit to wear with this suit. "Don't be upset if I feel uncomfortable or uncomfortable being out in the public. Let me make up my mind for me."</p> <p>"I'll be the judge of that," Teela said. She grabbed him by the shirt and pulled him toward the door, but then she turned her back to Tristan and walked toward the front of the bar. Once outside, she turned around and faced Tristan.</p> <p>"You know, if someone saw us right now, maybe you could tell my face," she said.
