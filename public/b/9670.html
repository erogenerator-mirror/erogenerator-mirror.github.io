I'd love to try new things."</p> <p>"Well, you're already doing something new and different. Just put some music on and I'll join in and help you out." He took another drink of wine.</p> <p>"Oh, okay. Let's take this somewhere a little more intimate."</p> <p>"Oh really? I'm not sure if we could go somewhere like that, in this rain, in this heat, in the dark. I'm sure there was a hotel somewhere or two." He took another drink of wine. Then said:</p> <p>"What do you call a hotel? It's quite a risk. What about a movie or a hotel?"</p> <p>"Oh, I'm sure there's somewhere where we could go, even if we choose to stay up at night."</p> <p>"Good, I've never been to a movie theater. I'd like to see what kind of food we could go to if we went in the middle of the day."</p> <p>"There's a movie I want to try. But you'd stay up at night."</p> <p>"I don't know. Maybe next time, I'll let me stay with you. I'm not sure I know how to turn that down." He laughed at herself.</p> <p>"Are you on the pill?"</p> <p>"Maybe. Are you?"</p> <p>"No, nothing to do with it. I don't either. What is that new thing about, you know, when I asked if you like to eat cum?"</p> <p>"I never really thought a guy would ever say that to me. I guess I'll just have to have it done and see what happens."</p> <p>"You're right! I could really use a good cum. I just can't go out on a date again. We'll have to wait until the car starts going around. What do you say?"</p> <p>"I'm not sure I can make that much of a decision just when I've got a good cum! Just give me a chance."</p> <p>Just then they heard the music start going. Then they heard music again. The silence seemed to last forever for what seemed like forever and then the music stopped.</p> <p>"Well, then, I guess I'd better get going."</p> <p>"I'll walk you. Just sit down and hold yourself upright."</p> <p>He walked her by the hand off, took her hand and led her back to his van. The back door slid closed with the door opened before she could get in. He locked the doors, adjusted the seats a little and told her to sit down.</p> <p>He was sitting on a park chair across from her. She had her left leg up but was sitting flat to her side and he had a full view of her. Her hair was still wet from the shower. He had also taken off his shirt and was lying there in his briefs in the middle of the night wearing sweat pants.</p> <p>"I don't mean to bother you, but it seemed like it was a long time since we've been to a movie theatre."</p> <p>"No, it's not an imposition. I'll just go to the hotel and get some food or something."</p> <p>"Let me get some wine up to you and I'll come sit over."</p> <p>He took his pants off first and then a pair of sweatpants. He'd removed his underwear the day before. For him it turned out to be a big turn on to her. He'd taken out a little of the wine without her noticing or paying any attention to it. When he got back he had his shirt off as well, but only had on a pair of jockeys, so he could leave that on the other side of the van. He took one of his sweatpants and put it under his chin, and then slid his underwear away from his face.</p> <p>She sat a bit down on the chair, but did take the opportunity to watch him. It looked to be a pretty good time there in the daylight with them watching in the darkness. He could be a great lay, but not so good as before.</p> <p>She leaned forward to look at him. At first he was just sitting there. Then he slid the thin piece that had been covering his crotch out of his hands and held it against his crotch all the way through his cock.</p> <p>He kept his pants back though. "Are you taking them off?"</p> <p>"No, they're ok. I didn't go to you or you to me when I did. Now they're off. It will be a little bit while longer before I cum again."</p> <p>He gave her another kiss and stood up to get his pants up again. After he did that he went to the back where he'd left the blanket and came back in his briefs and t-shirt but had left the rest of his clothes on. She could see the outline of his cock andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
