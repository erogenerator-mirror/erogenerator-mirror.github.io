Yes!" she yelled out.</p> <p>Her face looked like she was in tears by the looks on her face, as they came together in her orgasm.</p> <p>"I love you!" she said to him as she was slowly falling down from her climax.</p> <p>"I love you too, my dear!" he said and pulled the finger out of her pussy.</p> <p>Before she could stop him he stood up and pulled up his pants and pants.</p> <p>"I better go and get cleaned up before I throw a fit" he said.</p> <p>"But we have just met!" she said.</p> <p>"I know and yes. I have seen you several times already but never like this! You have been so beautiful when you were this cute and all I have wanted to do was hold you and kiss you all day long. And tonight I think we can take care of that!"</p> <p>"You said it was just lunch?"</p> <p>"Yes," he answered. "But yes, I was going to enjoy that but I'm sorry I said that."</p> <p>She just shook her head in reply.</p> <p>"Let me get cleaned up and go," he said as he pulled his pants up and buttoned them together.</p> <p>When she came out she got into her car and drove off before she decided she wanted to at least tell him to fuck her and kiss her again.</p> <p>As he sat there watching his beautiful wife get into her car he decided to go home and forget about everything that had happened with his lovely wife. He realized it was over. It was all his fault! He could not have ever been able to be a man like they had been with this. He wanted them again, to always be together. And maybe later, maybe soon. But right now he just wanted them both once more.</p> <p>Chapter 3</p> <p>They walked down the street and went to the parking lot. He kissed her softly again and again as she walked, knowing he hadn't realized a thing about her when she walked by him to go outside. "I'll see you tomorrow?" he asked her.</p> <p>"Yes, please, let's meet."</p> <p>She just held there as she looked at him and then she turned back and walked away, giving him time to get himself cleaned up before going her to the ladies room.</p> <p>When they walked in the front door she kissed him again as they entered. Her hand went up to his chest and he felt a tremor go through him as she reached up to unbutton his shirt.</p> <p>He unzipped her pants and pushed them down to the floor. He grabbed her ass and pulled her tighter against him before he felt the top of her pussy, the lips of her wet flesh that just before they had been pushing up against his member, slide across it, feel it as it found its way in between the lips of her pussy, rub around her clit until she began to come, screaming his name as she started to cum, her head thrashing from side to side on her chest as she went into orgasm after orgasm, never pulling her pussy back from his cock, keeping it inside her body forever.</p> <p>She finally had enough of feeling him inside her body. She broke their kiss as she reached down and pulled her panties off. He looked down and saw the wetness on her lips as she looked into his eyes and reached down, pulling the lips of her pussy apart and running her fingers over her slick flesh.</p> <p>He got down on his knees between her legs and leaned in to her until his face was right in front of her pussy. He looked up and saw the passion on her face as she watched him, waiting for him to start kissing her.</p> <p>"Do you like what you see?" he asked her.</p> <p>"Yes! It's beautiful."</p> <p>"Can I see yours?"</p> <p>"Yes! Just like last time."</p> <p>He moved between her legs and gently ran his head back and forth all around her slit, her pussy lips and opening to make room for his mouth. He sucked on her pussy from bottom to top, savoring every drop of her, every bit of her cum which he could find as he slowly slid his tongue all about her.</p> <p>"Mmmmmm, I knew you would be good! You are so beautiful, baby. Just like I remember them."</p> <p>By now he could hear his wife moaning and gasping. He looked up into her eyes as she stared down into his face. He could hear the slight slurping of her breath as she came down to his cock. He was enjoying himself immensely! He couldn't wait any more of the time before he fucked this beautiful woman.</p> <p>Soon he was licking her pussy from bottom to tip, his mouth working up andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
