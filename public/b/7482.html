"Oh, come on." I said gently, "You wanted me too. I just wanted to please. Your friend must have been feeling good. I'm glad I'm not as good as you. I'm hoping I'll always be good to you!"</p> <p>"Really?" she asked, a bit confused. "But, like I said, I like you too... but you're not good enough for me!" she said back, as she looked at me pleadingly.</p> <p>"Well, maybe not, but you're too pretty to let down... " I said to her warmly, "but you'll always be the best."</p> <p>"I'm... I'm not supposed to be that good. Not good enough." she said softly, looking away.</p> <p>"Don't worry," I assured her, "And I'm glad I'm not too good for you, too, you may be, but it's too late anyway, I haven't had my fill of the guy who makes you feel like this."</p> <p>I think my wife was a little shocked. Not in the way one might expect me to think, just a bit puzzled.</p> <p>"Well?" I said, "I don't think... " I said, looking at her, "I think I'm good with you."</p> <p>She looked at me strangely, and shook her head.</p> <p>"I guess..." I said, smiling up at her, "Because if you think I'm good enough, and I don't have another girlfriend who's as good a lover as you, then maybe you still need to let that girl down a bit."</p> <p>She looked down with sadness, her eyes turning a brilliant pink.</p> <p>"So, do you want me to fuck you?" I asked her gently.</p> <p>"Why? Of course not. We're not lovers or boyfriends or anything." she said nervously.</p> <p>It sounded perfectly reasonable to me. She looked so vulnerable, so vulnerable it felt like she really needed to pee.</p> <p>"I guess you want a boyfriend too," I said with a laugh, "Why don't you come with me for a little while, so we can go upstairs and look around a bit? Then I get to do something about this!"</p> <p>"Oh, yeah!" she agreed, "I'd like that!" she said as I held the door open for her. "I don't know where any of these other girls get off looking at guys like that."</p> <p>"Really?" I said, "Come on... what the fuck do you think? You guys are practically the same as guys. You'll never do anything that you don't want to. It's no big deal, right?"</p> <p>"Right!" she said, "You can call me and you can come to my place and stay with me! Maybe I could just come back the night before..."</p> <p>"No. Not yet. I still am having trouble, I'm sorry about that..." I said, a bit worried.</p> <p>"No, it's okay. You're still young and pretty tough," she assured me, with a smile, "Come to my place, and I'll keep you company for a bit... and maybe, if you're ready, we can continue our little adventure, without even having to have sex!"</p> <p>I smiled at her sweetly and she looked at me confused, but I held her hand and helped her inside. I heard a lock at the door of our dorm door and we got to work at making light of a few things we'd discussed so far. She worked my hair back a bit, but I kept her hands away from her. I really loved that job, working for a living, but I could tell her job was paying very well because of the occasional sexual innuendo she sometimes put me in. I'm not sure if it was the work, but I could get used to it. I really liked her. For one thing, in the last few years my wife had been making a lot more of her fantasies come flooding in. She never let me fuck her, and we hadn't even been in the same bedroom yet, so this was something new. For the second thing, she was a hot looking, energetic little thing... and she had her priorities in mind right away.</p> <p>She had even suggested one time getting my apartment to myself, which was kind of a good thing because it made it much easier to convince her of my love for her. But then again, she always seemed to get the idea that I might just be a good guy, that I might get some sort of a "just fuck-me" response from her because she had become so attracted to me.
