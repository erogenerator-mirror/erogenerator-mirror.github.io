She was a Goddess with a body that would make any man scream. She would make all his fantasies come true. I had no regrets about having sex with her. She knew how to make me feel great – so I wanted her as badly as my body did. We both shed a few tears as we started to laugh, our inhibitions vanishing. We were happy, she had her heart to say with her pussy and breasts to me now. We kissed as though we were one. The room smelled of sex.</p> <p>We took our time, looking at each other's face. We were both flushed and breathing hard. I wanted to do more than kiss. It was like it was the first time we had ever hugged in public. It was like I was kissing her. She was still breathless but her words were lost to the passion of our kiss.</p> <p>"Did you like it?" she asked.</p> <p>"Yes, I did." I knew the answer but I didn't want to admit it.</p> <p>"But I still don't have my lipstick on, okay?" she asked, looking down at herself.</p> <p>"Don't lie to me again," I said. "I am very serious here, that is true, but at the moment it is a big issue we're having."</p> <p>"You're such a sweetie," she said, putting her head on my shoulder as we cuddled up as if the world depended on it.</p> <p>"I have another idea for us to do with you," I added, "I like the idea that I can give you some real pleasure if you let me."</p> <p>"Maybe you can," she said as her head on my shoulder.</p> <p>"Okay," I said and got out a paper I planned to buy the night before. I held her hand and we got in my car. I opened the door but she stopped me.</p> <p>"You can still drive," she said, "although I need to get naked and into your bed."</p> <p>"No, we can't," I said smiling. I wasn't sure what to say to make her happy.</p> <p>"I can't let you drive," she said, "You've had a great evening, I need to be alone and relaxed. Let's go back to you and give us a second chance."</p> <p>****************************</p> <p>The next day our new friends, Mr. and Mrs. Williams, came over to check on us. Our clothes were still on the bed when we got to the bed and we were happy to go. Mr. Williams gave an enthusiastic tour of my new body with an approving laugh. Mrs. Williams took great pleasure in giving him a good show.</p> <p>We spent the day shopping, including my own collection of lingerie. When we went to bed, we lay in each other's arms but she couldn't resist giving in to my kisses as she had when we first got here. I was so happy knowing I gave in to her.</p> <p>She was naked, spread on my bed as I started to undress her. She had a small, pink flower tattooed on her stomach. Her hands went all over my body as I touched, licked, kissed and probed her.</p> <p>I was kissing my way down her body, licking every inch I could find until she had a big black cock between her legs. Mr. Williams made it clear that he really liked giving me oral pleasure. It was kind of naughty to share him with her.</p> <p>I wanted to make Mr. Williams cum so badly. To make him cum so much that he would have to masturbate to spurts. Then I could play with myself and enjoy his gift in the morning. She was the best of all, it wasn't really my fault.</p> <p>I took a second to think what to do next. When the time came, I went up to lie beside her and kissed her neck as I said the most romantic things I could think of. She kept kissing me which is why we were together so well.</p> <p>She took one of my nipples in her mouth and sucked it as though she was trying to swallow it. After about a minute she switched her attention to my other tit and started to give me the same treatment.</p> <p>"You're getting to me aren't you?" I said.</p> <p>"Hmmm," she said with a smile. "I know. I'm glad to be here and you are taking the time to let me know what I'm doing," she said, sucking my nipple to the very end.</p> <p>I didn't have to guess, she did something like that to me. My hand went down and started to caress her ass. There was a little bulge when my fingers met her pussy. I moved my fingers around the outer lips of her pussy as I kissed down her body to—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
