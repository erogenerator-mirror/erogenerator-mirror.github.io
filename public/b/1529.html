The only thing I know is that I'm ready. And I can't wait.</p> <p>That night I went back home pretty early and found the house in disarray. I went upstairs and found the rest of the girls on the couch watching TV.</p> <p>I walked in and sat on the edge of the couch and told them to go to the kitchen and put a pot of tea on the stove. When they came into the living room wearing just their robe I sat down and asked them about it.</p> <p>The first two asked me whether it was okay with me to come in and tell them what happened between my wife and I while I watched TV.</p> <p>And the third one was just about to speak when he stood up and walked into the living room.</p> <p>"Is that all you talked about all night?" he asked. "We've been discussing what we're going to do with you."</p> <p>I asked him if he really meant that and he didn't wait for me to answer but stood up when he moved close to me and placed his hands on my shoulders. He then leaned down and kissed me on the lips, which is the first time I'd ever felt a man kiss me. It lasted about ten seconds.</p> <p>"Well, I'm honored to be asked for that honor," he told me, his big hands slowly moving up to my shoulders. "I'm glad to see you and have thought many times about asking you to keep the other women in line,"</p> <p>It didn't take him long to undress me. I had never felt so naked in my life. His hard cock was pressing against my belly as he unbuttoned my blouse and undid my bra.</p> <p>"You know what, I have one of those chairs across from the couch," he said, as my white lace bra and panties came off.</p> <p>"And if you really want to have intercourse with my wife, just throw that in the hamper," he said, pointing at the hamper.</p> <p>"No," said the man across from the couch, "I'm not interested in intercourse. We're both old enough to be her parents, you and I."</p> <p>"No, I want more than that, I want you. I wanted to ask you to sleep with her. I wanted to watch her sleep with another man."</p> <p>"I haven't really done that," I said shyly. "But then I suppose it would be alright."</p> <p>"Would you be okay with that?"</p> <p>"Yeah," I said, thinking we had never had threesomes before. "I think I'm okay with it."</p> <p>"I'm very pleased he said that, but he did his best to make you happy. What he didn't mention was the fact that you don't like to see yourself getting your dick sucked. He also said if you wanted to go over to that bar and watch, your wife doesn't care."</p> <p>"I've never done that, but I want to," I told him. "I want to make you happy. I also want to see her with another man."</p> <p>"She isn't your wife anymore, that's why I wanted to ask you. I've never done anything with another man."</p> <p>"Well, I guess we can change that sometime. Right now, I'd like to see her in the shower with you, and you can watch her. Would that be okay with you?"</p> <p>"Yes, that would be fine. Go ahead."</p> <p>"I want you to watch me in the shower," he continued, "and you can watch me play with her."</p> <p>"Yes," I said, not looking at him but thinking that it was a great idea. He then stood up, turned around and walked over to the door.</p> <p>"Just one more thing," he said. "If I decide to stay, I want you to bring them in before they're all done."</p> <p>He turned around and walked back to me. I hadn't touched him for a while and I was afraid he would want me to touch more of his body than was allowed.</p> <p>He opened the shower door and stepped inside.</p> <p>"There are some towels and a box in there. They must have been for your swim suit. They're going to need to be washed," he told me, as I watched him drop his robe and step into the shower.</p> <p>While I was still in shock from his words, there was a knock on the door.</p> <p>"Come in," I heard.</p> <p>I knew it was my wife but couldn't tell if she was there or notâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
