I'll be back later."</p> <p>"Okay. I'll talk to Gina," she said, grabbing another pen. She wrote down the location of her office for her. "I'll call her back in an hour."</p> <p>"You're good. It's great to have her with us. I'm really glad you called."</p> <p>"I really like her too. But that's it." She turned and walked toward her office, her heart pounding in her chest.</p> <p>"Good luck!" Gina said as she leaned her upper leg across the seat and smiled at her.</p> <p>"Y'all enjoy yourselves," Mike said cheerily. "I was thinking the same thing."</p> <p>Gina took her seat as Mike was about to leave. "I'm gonna call Gina now," she called on board, "She should be on the call in about fifteen minutes so I need to get to work." She hung up, leaving several questions unanswered. "What am I going to do?" she thought to herself. At the same time she knew that was her first time at the game.</p> <p>Mike had called her. He told her that he was in luck. Gina had just walked across the parking lot and waved as she walked past his car where she parked. The woman in question was tall and slim, long brown hair and a body not unlike that of a tennis player. Her body was well proportioned and the two of them made a striking couple. She had the most incredible black t-shirt on that Mike admired over the years; a skimpy pair of black thigh high stockings, and a black mini skirt. Her legs were long, but she kept them in very shapely high heels. In his opinion, she was an incredibly sexy package.</p> <p>She was the first to arrive at his office after she had gone inside and got seated at the large round table in the back and handed a note to him. As soon as she was sitting across from him her eyes lingered over him. He made no move as he took the note and read it. She was staring fixedly at his crotch and had a wistful look in her eyes.</p> <p>"You're early," he said, trying his best to appear nonchalant. "I just wanted to let you know that I took the time for myself. You know, being the only one that isn't in here getting wasted on someone else." After a minute or so he leaned in towards her face and began to speak. "It was also a nice change of pace for me to be alone with you this early in the afternoon, but I had a lovely afternoon. I'm really glad you got to see the game."</p> <p>She had been looking down at his crotch again. His hand was resting on her knee. "I know you want to, but there is a part of you that doesn't agree with that," she said and looked up at him. Their eyes met and were locked in a stare for just a moment. Mike wasn't convinced, but he was still feeling the effects of the alcohol.</p> <p>"I think I know what you're thinking. I know a lot of things, but I didn't realize how much until I saw you today," he said. He was not going to let this conversation come between them. He needed to get her to agree to come back to his office later this evening.</p> <p>"And now it's here," she said. "You and I can talk about other things."</p> <p>It wasn't a question, it was a response. "You're too beautiful. I just thought I would enjoy staring at you."</p> <p>"The two of us can get on with your work, alright?" she said as she rose into his arms. "I was really worried at first."</p> <p>"Well, I have no problem with what you were doing. We had an excellent time together."</p> <p>"Great," she said with a smile. "Can I do a little shopping? I like it when you buy a lot of things." She smiled and put her arms around him. "I was planning to just get a change of shoes and change from the regular shoes to something more stylish. You know to the style I've been dressing."</p> <p>Mike was a little shocked. She really didn't have any underwear on.</p> <p>"Don't worry. I know a few things that you'll like and I won't let any other things bother you. I love dressing."</p> <p>"You're all right," she said to make herself feel better. "It's just that the way I live, I don't have that many options on how to dress. I know you guys are in touch with your bodies. It makes me nervous."</p> <p>"I don't know what you're talking about.
