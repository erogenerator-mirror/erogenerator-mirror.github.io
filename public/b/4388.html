I can sleep on the couch beside you, if that's what you want."</p> <p>"Well, I didn't mean I want a baby, but I have no intention of putting it in a father."</p> <p>"What you have in mind is an old friend of I don't know if you can handle him, but it might turn out okay because he doesn't have a dick but is able to fuck. We could both find something fun there, like eating and watching a movie."</p> <p>"Well yes, that's nice, but maybe when I'm ready and the mood strikes me there, this might be more fun."</p> <p>"If you're on the pill, and you tell anyone, I can take him."</p> <p>"That's not really a problem, we love each other!"</p> <p>"You really need to stop talking about being a father, or you'll be all alone for a long time. There will be plenty of good to bring home, so please don't keep me in suspense."</p> <p>I said that he could stay for as long as he wanted and told him my love for him and what I felt.</p> <p>As I left I watched him kiss the end of his prick while he licked and sucked on his fingers, thinking about what it was like to have a father. His prick felt nice and hard, his balls were very nice, so I just had to take a break from playing with it, so I went and bought a condom and put it on the night stand. When I was done I checked my email to see if there were any messages and found none.</p> <p>A week later I picked him up in the airport and we talked for an hour while I changed out of my clothes and into a new pair of jeans and a red ribbed camisole.</p> <p>That night I put on the camisole and he had to be able to look at my tits, which were hanging out and he couldn't just pull away. We went to a local pizza place and he ate pizza, which he liked. I took care of the rest of the night while he ate, and when we left he gave me a kiss when I was on my way out, saying that he was going to have his cock sucked.</p> <p>When I got home I knew he would be coming up for another round of sex, and it turned out to be a lot fun. We had a threesome once, and I felt that it would be different than it had been with me the month before, while he fucked me.</p> <p>That night we had a nice hot steamy foursome, and that night we were going to make love, and be together, for the rest of our livesâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
