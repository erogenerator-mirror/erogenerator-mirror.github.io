"The man you are dating probably already has an idea how to fix all this, because now that he is going to let you go, I have his heart. This is your choice, but you might want to try for yourself. If you do, maybe, but it will take your mind off the consequences. I will be able to tell you what I would like, and I will have this in place by the time I get there. Just don't let him get a clue, OK?" He smiled and agreed as he walked out, I got in the car and we pulled out of the parking lot."</p> <p>I walked down the street to my apartment, looked in my closet and found a pair of jeans with my T shirt on. I went home to change, which I thought I could do since the night was still a little early. I walked into the bathroom and tried to make my thoughts go back to our time spent with David today. That feeling of him in my life started to fade as my mind drifted to last night. I put on the clothes we talked about and had a shower. I was dressed in no time and walked downstairs to get myself something to eat. That feeling I knew there was no going back.</p> <p>"So what did you think, what did you think you would end up doing?" he teased me as I walked through the door.</p> <p>"What did you think I would end up doing? That I thought maybe I would end up getting laid?" I shot back at him with my mouth hanging open. "So I guess it is your decision what to do now?"</p> <p>"Well I hope that it depends on what you decide, and your decision is up to you, but do you trust me?"</p> <p>"I trust you. You don't have to take the decision you're choosing, I would have to take what I have now" I said with a smile.</p> <p>"What, have you been reading my mind now?"</p> <p>"No, actually you are the one who chose that option, I want to give you what you desire, so I will get what you want." I said smiling, then walked with him in to the kitchen. My thoughts were on him tonight, what if we became a threesome now.</p> <p>"Yes, I think I do want to do that, and I want to know which of us it is now." I said getting a smile in return then walking in back toward him again.</p> <p>"I don't know, do you?" I asked, then started walking to him. I stopped directly in front of him, as I was not prepared for what he had in mind for us tonight.</p> <p>"I have been reading your mind tonight, do you have any idea what my answer will be tonight?" I smiled, and I saw a tiny spark of recognition light up around his eyes.</p> <p>"Well, first, have you ever been with a woman, I mean, do you think? I mean, it would be really wrong to ask, but just the same, we would start out with a kiss, with your lips touching mine." He told me a little shocked then smiled, he looked at me over his shoulder and I saw a pained expression go through him as he saw what I was willing to do. "I have never been with a man before" he said in a small voice as he ran his hands through his hair, I could see his nipples harden in the light of the room. "Did you think that I had never thought about fucking another woman before? How could you not want me any other way? You have to, my mind is going nuts with thoughts. But I want this, and I want you to let me have what you want. I do want this, and I want us to do it tonight. I want to make it really, really go."</p> <p>"I want this too, and I want to do it too. This is something that I just want to do now." He said pulling me over to him. I could feel my body heat as he ran his hands over every inch of my body. His hands moved down to my ass, his fingers digging down as he got to my wet cunt. I could see him licking his lip, he ran his tongue up and down my slit, teasing my hole with his tongue just before he made a lick up to my clit. I couldn't help it, I arched my back as he licked me, his tongue pushing inside me while his finger started circling my ass.</p> <p>"You like this, don't you?" he asked with his mouth wrapped around my nipples, his fingers sliding inside my ass. I couldn't even think straight. The fact that he was taking me for me was a shock, but it felt too good to care anyway. His finger madeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
