He can't get enough of me, he'll come back for more, you know."</p> <p>"No, I don't want a baby. I want you to come to a real man in bed," she said. "Because I intend to make you mine every day!"</p> <p>"You were always so damn sexy and wanted to be used. I want you on your back so badly that I can't stop looking at your beautiful body."</p> <p>Her head fell back onto his shoulder. I'm yours forever. I'll never forget your eyes. They changed me forever, he thought, but that's just the beginning.</p> <p>"I'm in love with you, baby," she sighed, wrapping her arms around him.</p> <p>"Don't forget to keep me, always," he promised.</p> <p>"I'll always love you," she sighed again, kissing him gently on the lips. He kissed her back, holding her close to his body.</p> <p>"You're such a goddess," he gasped, pulling an arm around her.</p> <p>"Don't you ever call me that," she giggled, breaking the kiss. "I'm going to put my pillow to bed now."</p> <p>"Please stay with me tonight," he pleaded.</p> <p>"Promise?" she giggled. "I'd love to have a baby next to you."</p> <p>"You're such a sweet thing," he smiled. "Let's go to bed."</p> <p>"Wait a minute," she laughed. "This isn't fair, we don't have time."</p> <p>She laughed again, and turned toward her bedroom.</p> <p>"Come on," he called from the door.</p> <p>She opened her door a crack, and he stepped inside, his face level with her hips. He lifted one foot up to touch her thigh, a hand on the other ankle, then the other leg, pulling her closer to him. His arms encircled her waist and he leaned his chin forward, giving her a gentle, hot kiss.</p> <p>"I've been saving this for you," he whispered, as his lips moved over her forehead, down her nose, and up to her ear. "Now that we've got an early start, I think our baby's going to make it right."</p> <p>"I want you," she gasped after he kissed her on the lips, sucking the tip of her tongue. Her face flushed even redder than when he'd kissed it. He was so close to her, she could feel it in her legs, the heat of his body. He had turned her onto her stomach, and pulled her hips, turning it toward him. The tip of his cock teased her wet opening, making her moan, making contact with him aching for him. He kissed his way up her rib cage, teasingly teasing her nipples, watching as they hardened under the cool air. He nibbled her neck, his kisses teasing, making tiny whimpers of frustration and pleasure roll through her. He turned his attention to the junction between her legs, gently sucking her lips, gently brushing a fingertip over her tiny, rigid clit. A gasp of pleasure erupted from deep within her.</p> <p>He bent his head to bury a kiss, teasing, nibbling, tasting, biting, and teasing.</p> <p>His right hand moved to cover her mound, dipping into the softness, making a trail of fire. He watched as her body arched, her back arching. Her feet spread, her arms around him, and her hips tilted upward, begging for him, begging for him to fuck her. She was so wet; his finger had slipped inside easily, and her thighs gripped his hand, holding it. He couldn't resist her. He wanted her for himself. He pulled her to her feet, lifted her up onto the bed, and turned her to lie on her back, her legs wide apart, giving him full access.</p> <p>He leaned over her, his body hot on hers, his cock pressing against her, sliding over her thigh. She felt the tip press into her, his cock rubbing against the lips of her pussy. The tip of his cock pressed against her, sliding along the length of her pussy, the tip of his cock pressing against her other thigh before slipping inside her, stretching her, stretching her. He pulled away for a moment, just the tip of his cock head brushing up the length of her soft pussy lips, before pushing himself inside, making her moan, until he bottomed out inside her.</p> <p>"Yes baby," she moaned. "Shove that cock inside me," she said, thrusting her hips up at him. "I need you to fill me. Put it all in me, fill me," she whimpered. "Yes ohhhhh god yes. I love you, oh godâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
