Then, reaching up to cup his heavy balls, she wrapped her lips around one fat, fat cock, sucking gently while she stroked the other, and he let out a short, deep groan when she slid her mouth up the top of his erect prick so that the head of his long, swollen cock popped inside the moist depths between her lips.</p> <p>"Ohhhh, God, my cock is so hard and so fucking big. I'm gonna—Oh, God, God, yes!" he gasped as she sucked him, and he grabbed her thick hair as her lips slid up and down the length of his prick. He held her head against him, thrusting his prick harder into her mouth as his head fell back, his body shuddering as the warm water ran into his prick.</p> <p>He felt her hand sliding up along his hip, around his waist, between his thighs, then up the crack of his ass.</p> <p>But he didn't care. Even as she fingered his anus with one hand, his cock felt as if it were in another dimension.</p> <p>"Oh, shit, that feels so good," he whispered as she slid her hand up along the crack of his ass, then slid a wet finger inside his anus, rubbing his prostate. "Keep sucking him, baby," he moaned as her finger drove deeper inside of his ass, then withdrew before sliding back in.</p> <p>She began to fuck him with her finger, sliding it slowly in and out of him, faster now as she took the big, swollen head of his cock and rubbed it along her thick, damp lips. Then, pulling the finger out, she slid it back in again, and he raised his hips off the bed, driving his prick deeper into her mouth as her finger slid back inside of him. The head of his cock made a little popping noise as if something had popped out the top of it, and as she withdrew it, she took some more, sliding it across her lips, coating them with his pre-cum.</p> <p>She began to suck him again, the finger buried in his ass, her lips around him, pumping slowly while she pushed his cock deeper into her mouth, sliding it all the way until it was wedged in even deeper.</p> <p>"Oh shit, yesss!" he groaned as she swirled her tongue around his cock, then took it completely in her mouth again, sucking it as she pumped her mouth up and down his huge, hard prick.</p> <p>"Unnnngh," he muttered as his hips started moving like pistons, pumping his prick further and further into her hot, wet mouth.</p> <p>"Good! You like that, don't you, Tom? You like fucking my mouth, fucking my mouth," she said as her finger slid deep inside his anus, moving it against his prostate, and he let his legs go, lifting his ass almost off the bed as she slid her mouth down on him, fucking him, sliding her finger all the way in him as she sucked him. He felt his legs start to shake, and he put his hands on her head, holding her there as his hips lifted up from the bed and his cock began to spew its thick sperm load into her hungry mouth.</p> <p>Hot ropes of thick, creamy cum shot into her mouth, filling it as he held her head in place as he let his penis throb, letting his hot semen fill her mouth.</p> <p>"God! I love that. It feels so good, baby." he cried as the last little glob from his penis slipped out the tight little mouth of her.</p> <p>He slowly lifted his hips off the bed, letting his cock slide from her mouth, gasping, panting as he let himself drop back onto the bed, his legs fluttering as his cock deflated.</p> <p>"God, that was good," he said as his breathing returned to the normal rate and he sat up, trying to regain his composure.</p> <p>"Yeah," she said, "That was very good."</p> <p>Tom lay on the towel covered bed, his cock still softening, its head a little drooping, and he looked at the ceiling for a moment. "Well, well," he thought, "That wasn't how I wanted it to go."</p> <p>Turning his head sideways, he looked at the ceiling. "It's true," she said, and she lay on the bed next to him, her bare chest on his, their arms intertwined.</p> <p>"That was a good thing," he thought as he squeezed her breasts, then he realized that it wasn't enough to get them into the same kind of mood that he was in. He couldn't believe how much she had turned him on.</p> <p>Then he remembered their conversation, and he reached around to stroke her—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
