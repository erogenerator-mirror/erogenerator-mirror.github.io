Her left hand began working on her pussy even faster, as her right started rubbing my balls and stroking the length of my shaft. She lifted her body a little as she worked, her nipples pointing up at me, and she could feel my mouth on top of her lips as my mouth closed over her.</p> <p>"Oh, my God, that's so good," she panted, as she worked herself up and down my member, "ohhh, yes, that's good."</p> <p>I closed my eyes for a moment, feeling the pleasure of her pleasure as she came, and I looked down briefly at her face, looking into a passion that was unlike any I'd ever felt. She smiled up at me, and as I lay my head against the back of her throat, I felt my shaft twitch.</p> <p>"Oh, please keep going," she said.</p> <p>I opened my eyes again, and saw her smiling down at me. As her mouth released me, we both watched each other. She took two quick breaths and then looked into my eyes again, this time with a devilish grin.</p> <p>She moved up to lie beside me on the bed, our arms around each other, her hand rubbing on mine.</p> <p>"Let's try to make you forget how many women can give you that pleasure," she said, looking into my eyes, her finger teasing my tongue.</p> <p>She pushed her fingers into my mouth, and it took almost no time before she brought them to my tongue.</p> <p>"Let's practice that!" she said, "I'm wet enough already. You can taste a little of the ambrosia."</p> <p>Her fingers were moving now in a circular motion, working her clit, and as she looked at my face, she began to run her index finger up and down the length of my shaft, stroking me in and out of her mouth.</p> <p>"That's it," I whispered, as I put my hand between her legs and began to rub her inner lips, "come for me, sweetie."</p> <p>"Oh, you are so good, lover . . . this little game, isn't it?" she smiled. "I can't wait for more. You do have some tricks left. . ."</p> <p>"There's always more ways to touch you, sweetie," I said, "but you should use some of mine, too."</p> <p>"Hmmmm," she said, as she continued to stroke my cock up and down, and I put my hand back to her breast. She looked over at me again, and as her finger circled the tip of my cock again, my tongue ran along the upper ridge of her nipple, feeling the silky softness.</p> <p>"Mmmm," she purred, "I want you to do this. . . . right now."</p> <p>We moved to my side, and after pulling up her nightgown, I rubbed our upper bodies together, feeling the excitement of my hands on her body, and I started sliding my left hand up her left thigh.</p> <p>As she stroked my cock up and down with her right hand, we could see her body and touch each other's, our fingers exploring and caressing at the same time. As I massaged her, I could feel her breath quicken, and we moaned at the contact.</p> <p>As she stroked me, she looked down at herself and pulled up her nightie to show me her breasts. I looked into her blue eyes and smiled as she ran her fingers down the front of her body, moving toward her lips, her lips that were opening, inviting me to slide my cock inside of herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
