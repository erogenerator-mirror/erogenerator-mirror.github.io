I knew that I had to stop, at least for a little while. I knew that he was the source of my problems, but I had to make him understand that I had to be there in the end.</p> <p>"Please, let me ask you something. You aren't the enemy. You're more like the father of the family, I believe. Are you aware that we're going to have to kill both you and your husband? If it is something that I don't want them dying, I would do anything to help."</p> <p>When he said that, he started to cry. I just stood up to him and hugged him until it was time for him to go home. It started to feel wrong to him. Maybe, if we all agreed and they had their children here, maybe it wouldn't be so bad.</p> <p>"I'll look after him. I'll be as good as new."</p> <p>"Goodbye, my sweet."</p> <p>I knew that she would try to talk to the bastard, but I knew that she couldn't do it even if she had to. I was wrong. When he was gone, she and I hugged each other and made plans to tell the rest of the family. If she did, it would be too late, so she let me go instead. I didn't tell her that my husband was already dead and that she should kill him. I told her she had to do it, so she could save his life, even though it was probably a lot harder for her to do.</p> <p>When she left, I just sat at my desk and cried at the thought of all that I had done to my child for the last fifty years. There was no way that my husband was going to die in my arms.
