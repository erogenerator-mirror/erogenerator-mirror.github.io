There was not anything sexual that he could do, and there wasn't anything to be done that could affect our relationship, so we were all just making the best of our situation.</p> <p>I was having a great time with my daughter and enjoyed the company. She was being playful, and I couldn't help but find her a very attractive young woman. After all, if she didn't like it, this was her fault. That being said, neither could I really say to what I considered to be an acceptable lifestyle for my childbearing years. What would she do? Would she even know what she had, and, when she did, as she would not see the harm in what I put her through? Did she really have an interest in me? Did she really want me?</p> <p>Gabe spoke first before I had too much to say.</p> <p>"Are you ready, baby? Do you want more?"</p> <p>"Yes," I told her smiling.</p> <p>He lifted his mother's head up from me and kissed her lovingly on the mouth. Then he lifted her up until they were face to face. Both of them smiled, and then they both looked at me. I could almost see into their eyes, and I knew what they were thinking. It wasn't all that bad. The night had come, it was a lot to take in. They both had a very interesting relationship going, and were very understanding about it. Of course not being sexual equals sex, and I know I didn't want to lead them on. I wanted them to be what they were supposed to be, not what they really wanted. For the first time since I had been doing this, they both wanted me. Neither of them had ever tried anything that I hadn't thought the other had in mind. We had been together through a lot, a lot in fact. I knew, without being a part of the equation, they could have just as easily stopped it.</p> <p>They were both naked now, lying in a very comfortable embrace, their faces so close to each other that I was afraid. Then they smiled at me again, and the tension in their eyes was palpable. They looked absolutely perfect, with their flawless complexion, with soft skin showing over the black satin bra they had on, with black leather thong, and matching stockings, the suspender clips just reaching the top of their boots. Their breasts were small and firm, with their hard protruding nipples standing out from their upper half. They had the look of two perfect children ready to be pampered.</p> <p>As soon as they had felt comfortable with me in the room, Gabe took that as his cue to lift his daughter up and carry her over to bed. He placed her on the bed, with his wife in the middle. His daughter was already in a state of shock. Gabe laid back on the bed, waiting her next direction in life.</p> <p>"We have got to stop," was all he said. My wife looked up from the pillow beside her in fear.</p> <p>"We won't!" she told him. "I'm not sure of what I want for the next few weeks, besides being with you. Just you." she added with a big smile. I was looking at them both very closely. I couldn't help but wonder what they were thinking. They looked at each other with their eyes just barely closed. I would love to be able to judge that. But, there are always ways to tell if you are on the up slope.</p> <p>Gabe and I looked at each other. I smiled and nodded at him, wondering if it really would have meant anything. It wasn't any more than a question mark. I was surprised at how much they were in love, what they were feeling for each other, but how much more. I looked at Gabe, too, and I could see the love in his eyes. I think they might still be a little in love with each other. His wife was also in a state of shock.</p> <p>"How long?" he ask.</p> <p>"A while, since I had my first boyfriend. He did it all for a short while, before he met my daughter," I told him.</p> <p>"Gabe!" my wife said, getting up the courage to shout at him. "Look at that!" she told him. She looked as if she meant to ask me something, but she really couldn't bring herself to do it. She looked to her husband for help. I don't know what she saw in the look in his eyes; I was going to give her everything that she wanted. He gave her a weak look, and she gave him the look of someone scared to look at her.</p> <p>I turned to Gabe.</p> <p>"No honey," I said. "This is important."</p> <p>"You're right about me wanting herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
