She said.</p> <p>"What?" I was a little worried at what was coming next. If she did have a threesome, she was going to ask me to have sex with someone again, while she watched.</p> <p>"You know... you want to fuck someone other than your husband, right?"</p> <p>I was confused by what she had just done. She seemed so happy to hear that about herself, but I was a little apprehensive.</p> <p>"Um... I don't know..." I stammered.</p> <p>She started to laugh. "No... I don't think... you really do want..." she asked tentatively.</p> <p>"I am really interested in," I said.</p> <p>"You sure about that..." she said as she leaned back against the couch. "And I am really, really ready just to watch you fuck somebody else." She said as she moved across the room and stood next to her roomie, the woman who had been sitting next to him while he was getting dressed.</p> <p>I got to my feet and moved over to her. She had loosened up considerably since she had last seen her last lover, after the first blowjob that they had taken, and this time we were going to have the time of our lives, just like we would each have our turn as my date. She was leaning over and kissing me quickly, so much that I could barely breath.</p> <p>She took her dress off, dropping it in the pile, and then took a step toward me, and I stepped out of my pants and boxers. I felt her hands on my shoulders, and then her lips on mine as she kissed me, slipping her tongue between my lips with a sexy hunger I had never seen before. Her kisses were deep and hot, and I was already feeling my second orgasm approaching just from kissing her.</p> <p>"Oh yes, do it, suck my pussy, I want you as hard as you can be for me too," she hissed between her parted lips. She pressed her hips forward so that her pussy touched my cock. Her mouth was still on mine, and then she leaned away from me again, as I reached down and slid her dress straps off her shoulders.</p> <p>Slowly, gently she undid her bra, and then let it fall to the floor, leaving her standing in front of me in her lace-throughs and naked. She bent down to unbutton my shirt, letting me take it off, and she slipped my shirt out of my pants. I was on my back with her, leaning over and kissing me, our bodies touching all the time. Her arms were around me and gently she caressed my chest as her tongue teased my lips. I could feel her naked chest and her soft hands caressing my nipples through my thin bra.</p> <p>I had lost all track of time and of my time in the store, as my hands continued to explore her body. She broke away from my lips, moving away. She had a towel over her lap and sat on it, reaching behind herself to unhook the bra, letting it drop to the floor. Then she lifted her feet up onto the table and stood for my inspection. She was now completely naked, as I hadn't even noticed before.</p> <p>Her breasts were full, with tiny areolae and long brown nipples. They were pink and soft, and her skin was tanned and flawless, I thought as I took a nipple in my mouth. She put her hands in her lap to steady herself and look down at me, smiling sexily. She leaned over to kiss me again, and this time our tongues met and probed, as my hands slipped behind her to cup her butt.</p> <p>She reached down to remove my shoes and pants, and pushed my legs apart to stand to remove them and my socks, which were the one thing that was missing. I let the shoes fall to the floor a few seconds after they left the room.</p> <p>She leaned forward and sucked my nipples, first one and then the other, flicking it with my tongue as I had done before. She reached behind her to remove my own clothes, but I wanted to take a moment to caress her lovely breasts, so I reached over her to grab them, letting my tongue tickle her nipples as her hands went around my waist to untie my belt and open my pants. We were both naked now, as she reached for the waistbands of my boxers and pulled them off, tossing them to the floor. She pushed up to kiss my lips, then reached between us with a hand to touch my cock, and slid my boxers off, and then I stepped out of my boxers, letting them drop to the floor once again.</p> <p>I stepped out of my boxers and she reached up to stroke the length of myâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
