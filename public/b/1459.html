He grasped both fists, and started running them over her face all over. He was going to do it slowly so as not to hurt or hurt her, but she was not going to argue, she seemed almost to have lost any desire to fight him as much as he was trying to stop her from being raped. He rubbed his palms over her face, and then his hand started running it's way up over her lips, under each, stopping just below her chin. She shuddered slightly, and then looked up at him, a little frightened. He laughed, but before he could say anything, she had lowered her eyes again.</p> <p>He said, "Now isn't that a treat?"</p> <p>When he was finished, he got up, and sat on the bed. Then he stood up, and began to unbutton his shirt, his eyes never leaving hers. He slowly pulled away his shirt, then took a hand and brought it to the front of her, rubbing the soft fabric over her. She looked up into his eyes, then took his hand again and wrapped her arms around it so she could pull him down.</p> <p>She then pulled down his jeans, exposing the bulge in his sweatpants. She reached out and stroked it through the fabric. Suddenly she stopped and looked up at his face. "Now I want to see it, now."</p> <p>He just sat there in front of her as she began to undo his pants, not taking her eyes off of his, she started to rub his bulge as she took the pants away. She could see it was long and thickening. She let them drop to the floor around his feet. He stood in front of her, naked in only his boxer briefs. He reached out and stroked her cheek, it was so soft and warm, he couldn't wait to have her.</p> <p>Then she turned her back to him and reached back to run her fingers through his hair. He was standing there in his underwear, looking back at her body, not at anything that was happening, just her, watching her. She began to undo the buttons, her body shaking at the thought of what was to come.</p> <p>Then she put her hands in his hair as she slowly eased off his underwear. His cock stood as the tip of it just touched her belly. She ran her hands over his cock, then grabbed it, feeling and looking at its length and the shape. It was perfect and straight, a perfect length and thickness. She could feel it pressing out against her stomach as she reached around and held it.</p> <p>Then she looked back towards the door and saw the expression on his face. She took her hands away from his cock and looked back into his eyes.</p> <p>"Fuck me," was all she could say.</p> <p>He knelt and she got on her hands and knees in front of him. He leaned over her and kissed her deeply, his tongue probing her mouth as he ground himself deep into her. As he moved his hands over her body from her neck to her breasts she turned and leaned back on her arms. She looked back at him as he positioned himself so that she could feel every inch of him as he thrust himself into her. Her eyes moved from his face to his cock as he lowered himself onto her and kissed her again.</p> <p>She wrapped her legs around his hips and pulled him onto her. They rocked back and forth while he kissed her lips, her lips, her neck. The feeling of a cock inside her wasn't like she thought it would be, she let out a series of little moans. His weight was so strong on her as she could feel the bones in his stomach moving under their skin. She was feeling so warm and safe and he began to move.</p> <p>He put his hands on her hips as he started to thrust harder and faster. She wrapped her arms and legs around him as she held onto him and they fucked harder and faster. Then suddenly he started to cum and they both knew it as it began as his cock jerked inside her as she felt the warmth and wetness around her own body as they came together.</p> <p>They continued to move as he lay on top of her, and they kissed and licked each other's faces as they did so.</p> <p>When he finally rolled off her he put his arm across her shoulders, and gently kissed his way down her neck as he spoke.</p> <p>"You have to learn," he said, "there is no way you will be able to live without it. You had sex earlier, but that was to make me cum, so you have to learn to live with it. I know that's a hard thing to think about, but I know you need to."</p> <p>She didn't know what to say. How could he say that? But she felt that she had to do whatever was needed to beâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
