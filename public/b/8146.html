I felt my juices run out of me so he quickly pulled from my body. His breath hit my mouth hard as his cum shot out of him like a fire hose.</p> <p>It was the most pleasurable orgasm I had ever had. He quickly pulled me against him and began to kiss me.</p> <p>"I have to go now. Go home and rest before I have to start work tomorrow morning."</p> <p>We both kissed him and he drove me home. When he walked me over to bed, he didn't even touch me as he removed his shorts. He quickly undressed and crawled into bed. As he lay there, his cock hardening, I knew he didn't want to make love to me again. He had to wait until morning to let it take him.</p> <p>The next day I went home early and started work at the store. I had to be at the office by noon to get my lunch. On my way to the office, I thought I saw a car in front of me and when I looked, it wasn't mine.</p> <p>I got to the counter and there, was the sales person at the corner. She smiled when she saw me.</p> <p>"Good morning," she said. I shook her hand.</p> <p>"How do you want to start working tomorrow?" I asked.</p> <p>"I have an appointment for 11:00 and there is one other customer in an appointment right now," she told me.</p> <p>"If it's no problem, I could hang out a couple of times with my family for a few hours," I told her.</p> <p>She nodded okay and she sent off my appointment. My dad wanted to see me but I left him alone for most of the morning. I was sure he wanted to talk to me but was being ignored. When they got back to my office he sat down and had me get in a stall. He had me strip down naked and had me stroke his cock. I was really getting tired of masturbating. He came in my hand and I couldn't believe how much of a mess I was getting. The feeling was bad.</p> <p>He went in the next day and I stayed the night. We spent most of the next day having sex. When we finally stopped fucking, he used some Kleenex to cover his seed. When he came home in the afternoon, I was in bed with him. It was the morning after.</p> <p>There was a call from my dad and he wanted to know what had happened. I told him I liked him a lot. There was a knock at the door and a young girl answered it. She looked at me and said, "I'm sorry if I startled you, I got off work early last night."</p> <p>"Not at all," I told her and I kissed her. She asked for another job.</p> <p>"I know that I should be getting out of here, so, I'm getting in line to start a real job," she told me.</p> <p>I got fired, fired before lunch was through. My boss sent me a notice and a letter saying I should move on from the job I already had but just to move on. I went home with my father.</p> <p>I was really sorry for what I had done. It was wrong but it was my fault anyway. I just had to get through it. I was never going to get someone to be with me again. I couldn't stand anyone elseâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
