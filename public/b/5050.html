It had been years since any kind of bondage had been done to her. To have you blindfolded in a strange dungeon. She felt that this could only be to the benefit of the clients – and there was certainly no harm in it.</p> <p>And the sound of it. The way the chains pulled at her nipple rings, as she moved with her hands free on the chains. But was it the sounds that made her skin crawl? The suddenness of it; the way the chains stretched her shoulders and dragged downward from her chest as she was laid down. She heard a slight clinking of chains as the chains dropped to the floor, and then the click of clips - the sound was repeated. How could this be?</p> <p>Again.</p> <p>Again she felt the fluttering of chains, as the cuffs were clipped against her wrists and then the metal of her ankles in turn began to slide in a smooth and steady pattern. And suddenly she heard the sound of a zip being quickly unzipped.</p> <p>She realised that she was being stripped. Naked, even if the restraints were not. Her nipples were clamped, her breasts were straining against the silk corset, her labia was bulging, and her clitoris was swelling – the combination of all this added to her growing anticipation - making the whole experience seem like an adventure she'd never have been on before.</p> <p></p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p></p> <p>The sound of the clip-clasp. The sound of her nipple rings being clipped. The way she felt - her pussy being tugged. The sound of her clitoris being sucked. The smell and taste of her. It was all an adventure. An adventure she'd never have put her mind to.</p> <p>Her mouth was watering. Her breathing was uneven. She was sweating with arousal. And her nipples were acheingly hard. Hard enough to be pressed against her. Hard enough to be pinched.</p> <p>The chain from her collar chain snaked around the side of the cross and she saw her lover standing up behind her. She felt his cock probing at her ass, probing just at the cleft between her buttocks. Suddenly the pain was too much. She started in earnest to beg him to fuck her, and he thrust into her, holding her with his weight, as his fingers began to probe her anus, probing. Her cries had been stifled, but with those sounds she could clearly make out how his cock felt in her pussy as he penetrated her ass.</p> <p>With her head down in the air she felt the chain slacken until she thought she could barely breathe. She felt the weight of his body on her face. The feel of him against her. The feeling of her nipples rubbing against the chain. The feeling of him thrusting himself in her again and again. Her clitoris rubbing against the chain. Her mouth around a cock.</p> <p>Suddenly she felt a cold steel of the chain connect with the rings welded to the cross and she felt something press against her breasts. The chain was a handle, and she felt the weight. And suddenly the chain was twisted sharply inside the chain so tightly that it lifted her breasts up. The sensation was excruciating; the chain was so narrow she thought she'd never have them to support them. Her nipples were being manipulated in the metal. She gasped. The chain was pulling her breasts up, almost up. That felt too incredible. So different to the clasps of the chains. The feeling of being lifted up high off the table, like a pendulum. A slight upward pressure that was making her breasts rise and fall with an increasing rhythm.</p> <p>The chain was drawn more sharply by the chains. The effect was to bring on the chain. And she squealed as her breasts came alive. The effect of her breasts rising and falling along her chest was enough to cause the chain to pull and pull and pull and pull her breasts up and up. She didn't care. She didn't care that her nipples were clamped, she didn't care that there would be a chain pulling her breasts up and down her body. She just wanted to cum.</p> <p>She wanted to cum.</p> <p>She started to wriggle herself from the cuffs around her wrists and ankles. There was no escape. The chain pulled her breasts into a perfect shape, and she could feel their weight. And her breasts began to ache, and ache with the tension of the links and the chain. She needed release. The feeling of the chain pulled from her body was unbearable and the pain just made it more intense.</p> <p>At last, just as she didn't think she could withstand the pain which had been pounding at her nipples, she felt the chain pull gently from her body. The chain held her breasts in place as they moved back down the length of the chain. The chain made her lift her legs off the padded bar and press back into the metal at—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
