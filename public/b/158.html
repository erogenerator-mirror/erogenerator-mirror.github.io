When I told him what I had done, and how stupid I looked, as if he had been cheating on me, it kind of floored me. I did it because it was what I wanted to do and I did it because I wanted to see the look on his face when I showed it.</p> <p>The way I acted seemed bad to me. I don't remember the feeling, but everything was turning out fine. Maybe I just was feeling bad. Maybe I was too afraid; I don't know. For a brief moment, I liked what I saw. I liked that he was looking at me in a sexual manner, a way he probably didn't feel towards me. I don't know why I felt bad at all. I guess the way I acted was what I wanted to do, too. Maybe I was afraid he would take off and leave me. Why would he do that?</p> <p>The time passed. He seemed relieved. I guess he was.</p> <p>Suddenly, he broke the reverie. "Dee, I need to see you."</p> <p>"What for?"</p> <p>"I...I can't believe you wouldn't want to see me."</p> <p>"I don't want to see you, but I can't believe you wouldn't want to see me either. Are you sure about this?"</p> <p>"Sure. I will look for you."</p> <p>I looked around. There was no one else near the barn. My mind raced. Finally, I decided to say something.</p> <p>"Dee, what are you doing here? I'm your brother," I started.</p> <p>He looked at me with the most loving and apologetic look I have ever seen.</p> <p>"My brother, Tim."</p> <p>He looked down at me. It was as if he was afraid I would break again. I'm sure the expression I wore when I was telling him I needed to see him was the look of fear I was beginning to have. It was almost worse than when I told him I wanted to meet my brother. The look in his face was a little angry, but it was nothing compared to what I saw in his eyes.</p> <p>I didn't know how to react. I didn't know what to say. I was scared.</p> <p>"Oh, Tim," I said.</p> <p>"Dee. Look at me."</p> <p>I looked up into the face of my handsome brother. I looked into his eyes.</p> <p>"I think about you all the time," I said quietly.</p> <p>"I know, I know."</p> <p>"And I think about what I see," I said.</p> <p>"Dee. You really shouldn't see me, but I think it's pretty hot."</p> <p>My heart was beating faster and my head was spinning. He had to know I wanted him to see me. I had to give a little demonstration.</p> <p>"Are you sure you are okay? I mean, it's hard not to notice the way I look. I like the way you look," I explained.</p> <p>"Dee. You look so beautiful."</p> <p>"Thanks," I told him.</p> <p>I'm sure he was enjoying the fact that I was so turned on by him, despite the fact that it was probably just his way of having a chance to look at my body.</p> <p>"Come on! I'll show you the barn," I said.</p> <p>I didn't really think he had to go. I was already looking for Tim. I didn't even know him.</p> <p>When I pulled out of the driveway and headed directly for the house, I thought he might still be waiting for me. If I was going to let him see me naked, I needed to make up my mind.</p> <p>A few minutes later, I heard a car. Tim would be home in no time at all. I could have called him and told him I was having trouble at work and I didn't want anything to intrude on our time together. I could have done that but I had to. I was on my own.</p> <p>Tim looked disappointed. I guess he had been hoping I wouldn't tell him I saw him and had wanted to. I couldn't tell you how much I expected that would turn out to be to have him do it to me.</p> <p>I went to the front door and opened the door. Tim was there, too.</p> <p>"Hey," I invited him in.</p> <p>Tim looked uncomfortable. He probably thought my face was all covered with grease. There was that look again as soon as I sat down. I sat up straight and looked at him.</p> <p>"You okay?"</p> <p>He nodded.</p> <p>"This is your sister," I pointed out.</p> <p>He nodded again.</p> <p>"She lives here with her boyfriend," I added.</p> <p>Tim nodded.</p> <p>"That's good," I saidâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
