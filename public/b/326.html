You are the most beautiful woman in the world, she replied. We made out more in the cab on the way, and she had her hand on me through the cloth of my pants. I felt her warm, little hand explore my bulge, so I unzipped her jeans enough to free her throbbing cock, which was already hard. "What do you say we take this home with us?"</p> <p>She agreed, and we started off down the sidewalk, towards the house. "Let's wait for you," she said, as she stood behind me as we climbed the steps. The house was gorgeous and, besides the pool area, it was one of our better properties. "How long will it take you to bring it, then?"</p> <p>"Just a few hours," I replied. And we quickly found our way across to the basement level. Her house was a two-story, with a kitchen, a living room, and a huge bathroom. I followed her as she undressed, and soon we were naked inside her bedroom, our bodies pressing together as we got undressed.</p> <p>"I've never...this much." She whispered, as she slid a condom over my still erect shaft and took it in her hand to wrap around it, while she kissed me, her tongue flicking out to taste my cock. She took me in her mouth, making me gasp out at the feeling. The feeling was so good and she bobbed on my thick cock for a minute or so, then pulled off.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, this is not what I want right now!" I was feeling very nervous, although I still knew that I really wanted to fuck her, and had not had the opportunity to before.</p> <p>"I like it a lot, because I like having you inside me. And that can wait until the morning."</p> <p>She was right, and we lay down, each of us on her large bed, looking at the stars as I kissed down her body, kissing and licking her nipples and down her stomach, where we kissed and licked her through the fabric of the thong panties she had on. I kissed my way to her pussy, and slowly moved her panties down to reveal a beautiful little bush, and the scent and taste of her hot sex were just enough aphrodisiacs to make the whole bed move as I kissed and nuzzled her there. Soon she parted her legs for me, moaning and sighing as my tongue touched her and delved into her tight pussy, probing to make sure she was ready for me, then slowly slid down towards her pussy and sat waiting for me on her stomach.</p> <p>I had never kissed a woman in this way on their stomach, much less on her pussy, before, after the first time we had made love, but it felt so good and so right as she opened her legs fully to receive my tongue and lips. She was moaning and cooing as I licked her and sucked her pussy lips, then slowly slid my tongue up over her pussy to her clit and teased it with my tongue. "Ohhh, yes," she groaned. "Oh, yes, that feels so good!"</p> <p>And so I did, flicking her clit with my tongue. As I worked her clit, she was reaching down to spread her legs far apart, and I saw her pussy swell and part slightly, showing me her beautiful pink pussy lips opening to reveal the pink, wet flesh of her inner vagina.</p> <p>"You're so beautiful," I said. I kept on working her clit while licking up and down and up and down, while her pussy lips closed up, and opened up and her clit looked so inviting. Her clit was so hard and large, and I loved it because it was so sensitive and made me love her. And I loved the way it swelled and jumped. I knew my cock would not go unnoticed if it went any bigger, and knew she would feel it inside me, making her whole pussy feel so fantastic that she would cum any second.</p> <p>We continued on and on, my tongue bringing her closer to the edge. It was getting very difficult for her to get enough air, and she wanted me to move faster, but I couldn't. I wanted to feel her body all over mine, and had not done this since I was a teenager. Our mouths clamped together, and she had her own orgasm, which made me feel so good and so sexy.</p> <p>We lay there, not moving, kissing and stroking, and I felt her warm thigh come to rest on my chest and the head of my cock pressing against her vagina, and I slipped it in slowly. We made out for a few minutes and then rolled over again, making us both feel the warm night air, while we were still in the bed, but now I had beenâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
