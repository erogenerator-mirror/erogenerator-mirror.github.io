They were a team, and it showed, too. She kissed me.</p> <p>"I love how you kiss me," she said. "You're the one who said that if we kissed you, you'd kiss me back, right?"</p> <p>"Oh, yeah," I said. She smiled. "I'm glad we're friends."</p> <p>"I'm glad you're my best friend." And, of course, there's another part of that that's true. It's how you say goodbye to someone you might just be for a moment. For a lifetime. I think. And they do it, too, and it takes forever to say goodbye.</p> <p>They kissed again, and when her hand slid back down to my thigh, I got her off me. She didn't resist, though.</p> <p>"I'm sorry you kissed me that time, too."</p> <p>"Did you?" I asked, honestly, genuinely surprised by the question. "It's okay, really." I don't recall saying much more for the rest of the day, but it must have gotten me into a lot of interesting situations.</p> <p>That night was pretty wild. I slept well and had some fun. I didn't sleep well at all. When I got home in the early afternoon I was sore. Not like any time I have had sex in the past year. Not like a whole new batch of orgasms I have enjoyed. But, you know, at least, I was glad I hadn't been through with the night that began in January without a great deal of sex. I guess I'll never know what to make of it.</p> <p>That is, the day when I fucked Jane on the floor of the room of the house in which I lived? She came home a short time later in a t-shirt with only the lacy white panties she'd been wearing during the evening showing on her pale skin and the long strands of grey hair on her head in contrast to the white cotton of her pajamas. But, on her hips and on her legs, she came down with those long, black hair flowing over her body that, even with all the blood in my system, was still the sexiest part. She was so beautiful: her dark-blonde hair flowed from her face down below her breasts and down to her lower back, framing her beautiful, pale skin. It was a look I'd never seen on any man or woman, but I certainly appreciated. And her eyes? They were a blue-green-gray that had a deep greenish-pink iridescent. They were so different in the light as well as in their color from the light coming from her kitchen.</p> <p>And I looked at those brown eyes, thinking of them, as she bent over to kiss me, smiling with those eyes while standing in front of me as we kissed. I felt very much in love with her. I had to admit it. I'd never felt in love, or anything else, with anyone in my life, not Jane herself. And I knew in my heart that I wanted to be the good lover someday, regardless of the circumstances of our marriage of course. But we were going to be married for a little longer. We wouldn't be together until we said we were done.</p> <p>Jane said, "Come in. Come on in. I took a shower and brushed my teeth. You're still sweaty. Can you take a shower now?"</p> <p>"It really doesn't smell a thing," I told her and I took the showerhead off the shower curtain. And, it still did, but that was okay.</p> <p>"Can you use the toilet in the guest bath?"</p> <p>"No," I agreed. "I can't. You're too important to waste here so soon, right?"</p> <p>"No, not for me at all," she said, not bothering to look down at me. "I don't think I'll feel guilty if you take a shower before you're ready to take your shower. Especially if it's not too bad."</p> <p>"You've got that right," I said, and I turned the water on for Jane.</p> <p>"What do you do?" she asked. She was a little embarrassed.</p> <p>"I wash clothes for a living. I was going to try this out. It's a bit new."</p> <p>"New?" she sounded surprised.</p> <p>"Nah," I said. "New. I mean, for me, everything I'm talking about is new."</p> <p>"What do you do?"</p> <p>"I'm a writer."</p> <p>"And a writer? What do you do?"</p> <p>"That's what I do."</p> <p>"I'm a big reader?"</p> <p>"Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
