"It does help if you talk, too." I said. "The truth is, though, I've been with women. My best friend in high school and all those years from high school. I don't know how to talk about it."</p> <p>Sue smiled at me. "You can always go get a bottle of wine, honey." She replied.</p> <p>"Okay," I said. "If it's okay, if I'm going to do it now that it's over, let it go!"</p> <p>She giggled quietly. "We could do it another month or so, don't you think? You're the only one who can come and go for as long as you want." She said while laughing again.</p> <p>It got quiet again, and I finally took the opportunity to tell Sue about the sex games I had been having with Karen. She blushed in excitement.</p> <p>"The sex games are pretty fun." She said. "They can be intense. I don't think you should do any of them, but you can tell me if you like."</p> <p>"I haven't," I said quickly as if I was trying to keep my head down.</p> <p>"Really?" She asked curiously.</p> <p>"Well, Karen's in the next class, and I've got something I have to teach her." It was time to move on. Sue would not have been embarrassed if it wasn't something she had been talking about. It would be difficult to keep the conversation professional.</p> <p>She thought about it a moment, and then said, "So what are you going to do? Let's see what Karen tells you."</p> <p>I smiled at her. She really was cute and sexy. "Go lay out on your back." Sue said softly. "But just because you're on your back, doesn't mean you can fuck. Besides, I'm a little nervous about it."</p> <p>I felt a bit awkward, but tried to lighten the occasion by saying, "I'm not asking for a fuck, Sue. As long as it's something that you can do... and you can live with the consequences..."</p> <p>Sue grinned, and then sat back. It was obvious that Karen wasn't going to be very receptive to the idea of us sharing the same bed.</p> <p>"Okay," she said. "I'll just put the next bed up. Then we'll talk about it."</p> <p>I watched her as she slid off the bed and walked over to the couch and then sat down next to me on it. I watched her ass as she sat on it. She had to be one of my best friends from high school, but I had never ever thought that she was so beautiful. She was a sweet person, and had a great personality and a sense of humor. She had a body that I wanted to be able to spend time with. Her breasts hung gently on her chest, and were capped with large black nipples. I could see one of her fingers playing with them, and they were almost out of her hand. It was hard not to want to reach out and put my hand on them.</p> <p>"Are you okay?" I asked. "Are you feeling better?"</p> <p>Sue looked up at me, still resting her hands on my chest. At least, she did look good enough to eat. "I'm fine." I assured her. I was really not that worried about the sex games I was hiding from her. I had done some serious good to them, and wasn't looking to give them any more harm.</p> <p>Sue smiled a shy smile. "That's okay," she said, but then added, "if you're okay with it, I guess I can share you if you're not." It was her way of saying that if I said no, it was her way of asking if I was okay with letting her fuck other people.</p> <p>I smiled. "Just go ahead."</p> <p>She nodded her head slowly. "Okay." She said, her mouth opening in a surprised smile.</p> <p>I felt a little nervous at first. I hadn't really talked to Sue about these kinds of things with her, but I didn't feel ready to tell her I liked doing them. I really hadn't thought of asking Sue about it in front of anybody. What would she think of me doing them, and what would she think of if I were asking her what she wanted to do as a lover.</p> <p>My head was still tilted back, and I felt a little weird at all that I should be trying out these things with another woman.</p> <p>Sue saw what I was doing and frowned, and then turned to me. "I guess you're ready for the fun, aren't you."
