I wasn't sure if I should say something, but there was no point of taking a hint. It wasn't nearly as bad as the fact she'd had to go into the bushes for me, but more acceptable.</p> <p>"No, take them off. You better do that in the open."</p> <p>I did, knowing that we weren't going to do that for very long. I lifted one leg up, pulled them down, and then pulled them right back again. She let me do it, so I reached up and began rubbing my thumb right on my clit. Her response was to grab my hand and pull it faster and harder. I pulled it out, her hand grabbed mine and held it out.</p> <p>"I'll take that for you."</p> <p>She smiled and reached up, gave me a hug and a kiss on the cheek. Then left the office. I looked at my watch, found that it was 3 in the afternoon and waited until the time was at the other end and let myself in. I turned on the tv for the tv before moving to my computer.</p> <p>I spent 30 minutes reading through the papers. I wasn't totally sure how to tell her, but I was getting that feeling. I didn't know she'd be in the apartment, though I knew from my conversations on the phone that she had probably gone into the bedroom on her way into the other room. I turned off the computer and went to bed.</p> <p>About two in the afternoon I heard her leave and as I got up to head to bed I heard her door close and the sound of lock on the front door. I knew immediately what was going to happen when she came back. My heart was still pounding when she came in. She was wearing a short red robe, but it was tied at the back, and it really just came open a little at the top.</p> <p>"Honey, it's so good to see you."</p> <p>There was no question in my mind that she was going to ask me what I'd seen. I was nervous, as much as anything, but I still felt I was going to say something.</p> <p>"Thanks. I'm sorry I scared you."</p> <p>Her voice was soft. "It's nothing. After what little trouble I've been having, I'm glad it's the same here. It was a lot of fun. It was very educational."</p> <p>She looked into my eyes and gave me that kiss again. "It was a lot of fun. I've been having some fun too. It's like nothing you've ever experienced, except for that one."</p> <p>I turned onto my side and put my arm over her waist. Our lips parted. I felt her body move under mine. She was soft, warm and very moist. Our tongues began to dance as we shared in each other's mouths. My hand started to move around her back and then reached between our bodies.</p> <p>"Did you know I had been saving this for your girlfriend?"</p> <p>I nodded my head in response.</p> <p>"I knew you'd never think of me in the way that you always do." She moved her hands lower and gently started to caress my breasts, her fingers gently touching the skin on my nipples. They were quite large and when she played around the nipples was just so exciting to me. I could feel her heart beating right at the end of my chest, which she did as well.</p> <p>"Well, it was pretty exciting for me to see you."</p> <p>"Well, I hope you're not scared of a little pain."</p> <p>"No," we both said, "I'm just kind of surprised. It was really nice to be able to do that."</p> <p>"I was just wondering if anything like making love can happen. That's all."</p> <p>"Well, you can certainly get a free pass on that one. Would you care to go for a ride in the cab before we get back up to my place?"</p> <p>"Sure, that would be fun. Let's go."</p> <p>The rest of the evening went pretty smoothly. We were pretty quiet, though she didn't say much. That's not to say the girls didn't talk to me, they did. I think we knew it was a good thing since it made the experience that much more exciting for both of us.</p> <p>When we got up to her place after dinner that night, it was really difficult to say no. She didn't talk much about our meeting in the parking lot, but somehow she seemed to put it off as little, well, like we didn't have much time to ourselves. We hadn't talked about anything in the parking lot at all that night. It had been a while since the last time weâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
