He kissed her softly, gently, a little hesitantly. She smiled to herself. She couldn't get enough of him, the way his kisses felt, the way he had that moment—the moment they had when she couldn't explain that they could do this and that one of them might be willing to be lovers forever, and all at the same time. No, she wasn't looking for that, but for this one. It was the first time she had been able to come to terms with—the first time she had ever felt that—the first time she had felt that she might go through with another man, that he would be her first. She thought—thinking now, but not sure—that maybe she wasn't looking to rush things. Maybe she just wanted to savor this little night, to let the passion of that first time fill her with memories. She felt him stir underneath her and felt her own arousal growing. He raised up a little, and she moved closer to him until he could touch her.</p> <p>She pulled her top off, and dropped it down, so that it hung between them. He lifted his hand, and she reached for his, and her own hand slipped inside it, feeling the hardness of his cock, feeling the warmth there, feeling the pulse of his heart through the flesh of his hand, and she drew his hand toward her breast. They embraced in a soft, sensual, caressing kiss, both of them feeling the warmth of affection for each other. She knew she should be moving. She didn't. She didn't want them to. Her body ached to be inside of him. She wanted this to, to be full—she wanted his body inside hers—so that neither of them could stop, but it was so urgent, so needy. She drew his hand out again, and he lifted it to her breast, and she touched it, feeling the hardness, the hotness of it, the wetness of it, and she felt his hand run over her nipple and down between her legs.</p> <p>When they came together, he had the same hunger that she had, the same feeling of need. She wanted him so much, but wasn't sure how much she wanted him enough, so that she could feel him inside of her, so that she could feel all of him. She wanted to do what she had learned from the other men that night. She knew what it would feel like to have his body in hers, touching that body—her own body—touching her. She wanted him to feel what it would feel like to have him inside her, and she thought she ought to feel him inside of her, but instead she took his hand. She led it to her own breast, and he leaned forward, so that he could take her nipple between his teeth gently. He closed his lips around it and suckled it gently, and she felt the desire building in her. He was soft and warm and just as she was beginning to take his nipple into her mouth, she felt another set of hands on her chest and she felt hands on her breasts—on her body. She felt—felt him—the heat of him—and the desire of her nipples—and the excitement it seemed to both of them. She sucked at the nipple and felt his hand between her legs again and was delighted when he slid it down to her pussy. She felt it there, and he slipped it up to explore her. His fingers explored her, and she was sure that it was all that he had.</p> <p>She lay beside him in the small bed on the couch with her head in his lap—with her body right next to his. She let him have her then, but not yet. She wanted him, wanted—needed to feel that cock inside her, to feel his touch on her body. She wanted them to do each other just as she had done with the first two men in her mind. She wanted him to take her, and she wanted it like she had dreamed about, just as much as she wanted to feel him in her, but also to want him inside of her, that it wouldn't be the sort of thing one would be able to do in a life without knowing it, but she didn't care now either.</p> <p>She didn't want it. She wanted—of what—to feel him inside of her, to have the sensation of him touching her, touching her so deep. She needed to feel him inside of her, and she had no illusions that they would be going through that first time. She wanted him to take her, take her right then, on the couch, so she could feel him inside of her as he had taken her, as he had so often, with her body—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
