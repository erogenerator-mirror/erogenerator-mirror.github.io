She rolled to the side and leaned in and kissed him, holding to his face as her tongue explored his mouth. "You never thought..."</p> <p>"No." He felt dizzy.</p> <p>She pulled away, smiled.</p> <p>"No?"</p> <p>"I don't know!" He pulled her to him and laid her on her back on the bed. "I don't know that I could do it."</p> <p>She sat up, looking at him a moment.</p> <p>"'You sure do know! And so why won't you ask?" she smiled.</p> <p>"Well... you have been on my mind a bit, but I don't know how to say no. I would be too self conscious."</p> <p>"No!"</p> <p>"No!"</p> <p>"But..." She smiled, "I just don't mean to pry into things that are..."</p> <p>"You wouldn't want me to?"</p> <p>Holly just shook her head. "I'll keep telling you."</p> <p>He moved to kiss her again as he began to kiss her breast, working his way down her body.</p> <p>"No!" she moaned, still watching him, but more determined to try for the last step they could, not before and not just for the fact that they had both waited a long time before coming here.</p> <p>As he kissed and nibbled her thigh, she moved closer to him. She could smell his hair. "Wait," she said at the same time she stopped him. "I need to try something. I have never done anything." She reached out to touch him. "It's been so long, hasn't it?"</p> <p>He laughed, smiling that same smile that always melted her heart. "Don't give me your rules!"</p> <p>"Just let me try." She was about to turn over again when she found her panties. It was already soaked from earlier, so she didn't dare.</p> <p>He looked at her with her panties in his hand, thinking she was serious. But she shook her head. "No. No." She quickly put her panties on while he did what he did last night.</p> <p>"So what about me?"</p> <p>"What's that?" she asked, "What if I can't?"</p> <p>"You have to," he assured her as she smiled. "It's easy if you make me."</p> <p>"What?" She looked shocked and then she smiled again, but only if he had a little more.</p> <p>He pulled her hips to him and rolled her on top of him, then reached up and under her panties to play with her pussy. His cock was hard as granite as he started kissing her breasts again.</p> <p>"Do all men have a hardon?" he moaned when he got to her center.</p> <p>"Sometimes!" she sighed as he began to lick at her wet hole.</p> <p>"I thought we had established that we could do that. I thought then that we could do everything together," he laughed.</p> <p>"And you are still a virgin. I'm not that eager!"</p> <p>He looked at her with the grin of a man who had never heard that her vagina had felt the warmth she felt. "Well! No! Of course I know. And if you don't want me to go right on and finish you off then it's a good idea to have the first time I have, when you are ready."</p> <p>"I wasn't ready. I didn't mean to. Okay, I had never had a man in my vagina. But I still want to."</p> <p>"You don't really want a man in your vagina?" she asked him.</p> <p>"No!" his own moan made him laugh. He leaned up and kissed her, a long, lingering kiss, and then kissed her more firmly on the lips while he rubbed at her hole with his finger.</p> <p>"That's it, baby!" she urged as she pushed back at him while he rubbed at the tip of his cock.</p> <p>"It's not all good," he said, knowing that now it would be a long time before he could fully satisfy himself.</p> <p>"Honey! What are you talking about?" she asked when he inserted a finger into her tight pussy.</p> <p>"We need to try something. I can't think of anything that makes me more excited than your pussy."</p> <p>She smiled. "I get that you have a point."</p> <p>"I'm not saying you are going to get it right, but I think you will feel better and you can tell by the sound of it, you do."</p> <p>"Yes, I'll feel better."</p> <p>With that, she rolled on top of him, looking down to find his dick.
