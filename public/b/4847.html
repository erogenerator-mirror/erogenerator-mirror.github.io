"Don't worry, honey. It's no big deal. I could even help you clean up, if you want. But you're gonna need your rest now."</p> <p>"Thanks... but I guess I'm exhausted, huh?"</p> <p>She chuckled. "I'm not kidding, sweetie..."</p> <p>After spending a couple of hours sitting on his sofa, they began to chat, and as she got ready to go to bed, he pulled her back over on the sofa and laid on his arms. The next thing she knew she felt his hand run lightly down her back, and his hand rested softly between her thighs.</p> <p>His hand traced back up, stopping to softly cup her right breast in his hand. Slowly he rolled the hard, sensitive nipple in between his fingers, causing her to arch her back and moan softly.</p> <p>Her hand slid up his soft chest and rested on his hard cock, which was standing proudly to attention. She gripped it firmly in her fist and squeezed slowly, feeling it twitch under her soft touch. He placed a soft kiss on her head as she moved her hand down over his shaft.</p> <p>"You like that, don't you?" she murmured.</p> <p>He nodded. As much as he loved sucking her tits, he loved fucking her tits himself, and it felt amazing to be that close to her again.</p> <p>"Do you want me to suck you again?" she asked.</p> <p>They kissed again, this time much more tenderly, as his hands ran over her soft cheeks and pressed against her pussy, feeling his cock grow and harden again. She moved his hand down and he wrapped it around her bare bottom, which he had positioned there earlier, pressing it up into her.</p> <p>"Oh, god, I love the feel of your hands on my ass. It's so soft and firm..."</p> <p>She slipped a quick glance over his shoulder at him and took a deep breath, as did he. She began stroking him in time with his movements. His hands pulled her ass up and down with each stroke, and her cheeks moved up and down each time he thrust the base of his cock up into her. He could feel the muscles in her back move when he pushed upwards on his cock. He moaned again, as she increased the pressure on her ass with each stroke. The sensation was incredible. She reached up and cupped her tits hard, and moved the nipples between his fingers and rubbed them with slow, loving abandon. His cock surged in her hand, wanting to get even harder for her. He ran his thumb over the sensitive tip as his hands pressed her cheeks together, as though his will was not to let her release, but instead only encourage his hand, wanting to drive her further than she already was.</p> <p>She moved her middle finger towards her ass, to spread herself wide for him. He took a deep breath, letting his breath out slowly, and felt her soft flesh on his finger.</p> <p>He couldn't help himself. He slid his left hand down her body and took advantage of her left hand cupping his balls. He pressed the thumb of his hand into her soft ass-firm grip, and she moaned, her back arching up against his hand as the sensation sent her over the edge and shook her body to ecstasy. She could feel her pussy juice running all down and down the crack of her ass, and he felt her hand squeezing his cock as she shook through her orgasm, squeezing him and milking out every remaining drop of cum he had. His hand still firmly gripped the base of his cock, which was still pulsing inside her when she released her grip.</p> <p>As her body relaxed, he moved his hand out of the way and brought it up to the head of his cock to continue stroking himself. He pressed the head of his cock against her ass, pushing lightly but firmly, and she moaned again.</p> <p>"Mmm, that feels so good," she murmured.</p> <p>"I think it is because I just want to get out... and get some sleep," he answered, watching as her eyes closed and her lips parted again.</p> <p>She giggled. "Yeah, right. I know, that. And I know that would help you get to sleep, but it's not something I would do for you if I knew how much... you're going to want to be with me this weekend."</p> <p>He nodded eagerly. "That's okay..." he said. "This could be good for me too. I'll try to plan and plan for a few days without you, too."</p> <p>"Mmhh! So, we better get you ready. Otherwise I'm not sure if you can go again?" she teased him.</p> <p>"You know I love being with you.
