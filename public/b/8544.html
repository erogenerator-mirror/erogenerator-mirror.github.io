He said and she almost dropped her glass.</p> <p>"What?" "It isn't you." She said loudly enough for him to hear. She looked at him quizzically and he was about to turn around and take it back when he suddenly sat up straight again and looked at her like he was going to ask why her dress hadn't come down. She couldn't bring herself to look at him, she wasn't comfortable doing this.</p> <p>"Sorry," he whispered. "Did you lose it?"</p> <p>"It fell to the floor." She whispered. He looked at her skeptically, but she didn't care, so he turned around and sat back down. The whole time their eyes were locked on each other and she felt like she looked so much more intense than normal. He kept getting bigger each time. When he suddenly looked away from her she realized, in that instance their eyes locked. The smile on his face seemed to light up and she felt a wave of heat pass through her body. Their eye contact was intense. It was almost like an emotional connection, an understanding, yet it was a deep connection between them. He had to give her a lot of space.</p> <p>"There is something else." He said as he reached into his pocket and pulled out some papers. "I think you should leave."</p> <p>"But." She started to say but he put them into her hand and stopped her.</p> <p>"Don't be silly." He said. "You didn't lose your glasses or everything in the dress. The top wasn't covering anything, so it was fine. Now the dress is almost completely covering everything and it will really show."</p> <p>He looked at her. "So. Well, it looks like it's going to be a while to wear it again." He laughed. This is how they felt about each other lately. They were on the edge of falling out of love, but they hadn't wanted to. This was so far outside of anything else. This was their little secret away from the rest of reality.</p> <p>"Thanks." He said as he sat down.</p> <p>"No problem." She responded and reached in her purse. She pulled out a card and handed it to him. "The address is in my phone and by the way, I'm from Minnesota. My phone, my home phone, was in Michigan when I left Ohio. They said they're sending me back."</p> <p>"You're not so much of a fan of Michigan so there are some things that shouldn't go on in this world." His words hurt, "I don't like you leaving out here like that."</p> <p>"I guess." She answered. She looked back for a moment as if she was being rejected and realized, she was being seen. A bit of jealousy seemed to be building within her. "But, I have to do this, right?" She said.</p> <p>"Well, I am only a little ways from the coast." He said. "So what's that about?"</p> <p>"I have to go." She said.</p> <p>"You don't have to go. We can go somewhere and see one of my new houses."</p> <p>"We already did that, remember."</p> <p>"No, you don't have to do that, we didn't get to that point. All you have to do is say no." He put two and two together and started to walk up the driveway.</p> <p>"But it's only right." She pleaded.</p> <p>"Don't argue." He said and she felt her insides tighten under her stomach. She didn't have the right to be in this place.</p> <p>He reached out for her hand and squeezed it. It was so soft and soft. She felt a shudder run through her at how he handled it. It was like he owned her. He gently led her through the house and through a door. When she opened to the side, he turned and looked her up and down.</p> <p>"You look great." He breathed.</p> <p>"Thanks." She said quietly. He closed the door behind them and they walked back to her car.</p> <p>"You're a lucky guy to have a good wife." He said before handing her the keys and turning back around to leave.</p> <p>"I'm glad." She smiled. "Well, I am glad though." As she was walking to her car and driving off, the last few blocks to his house. The house she was staying at was on the lake. He drove off after her. They went back inside and sat on the couch for a moment before they began to kiss. It was tentative at first, but their tongues became as thick as thieves. He put one hand around her waist and pulled her against him. Their lips broke and he kissed her again. She felt so wet against her will. He took her hand to his belt and slid it beneath his trousers to feel his cock.
