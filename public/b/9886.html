We have to be professional, and I can't just pretend that I don't think of you the way I should. My boyfriend always says I have a thing for you in school dances, and it's not just because he gets my attention as I watch you get into a dance."</p> <p>She gave a brief flash of a smile, before turning to the waiter.</p> <p>"Can I get a bottle of champagne, please? Then there is the champagne for dessert?" She gave a quick wink into his eyes before closing the door behind him and leaving.</p> <p>"Why don't you go home, and forget about your boyfriend. I just want to know how your boyfriend has been since I walked in."</p> <p>"Are you sure you can't tell?"</p> <p>"Yeah, it's okay. I was just messing with you. I've always thought you had a big mouth on you."</p> <p>"So, you've told my boyfriend."</p> <p>"Yes I have. I even gave him what I think I've seen."</p> <p>"Why do you think that?" she enquired, then turning back to him.</p> <p>"Because if I tell you how I have been acting and trying to be a better person, you won't believe me, are you?"</p> <p>"Maybe, but I've been waiting for you, and I'll let you know when I believe you for sure."</p> <p>That's when it happened. She walked in to say hi, then closed the door in his face. It took him a minute or two to realise that she might not be exactly like last night, in one of her moods, but she wasn't there any longer. That's when he saw her for the first time. Not to say she was the hottest girl he had saw in a long time, but who could have imagined that she would turn out to be a whore like her? She walked right up to him and kissed him on the lips.</p> <p>"Hello," he greeted her.</p> <p>"Hi, you must be Alex? I'd like to call you Alex, but I'm sure I'll never be sure. I'm still a virgin."</p> <p>"I'm sorry to bother you."</p> <p>"You have no problem, I'm honoured. It's the first time I've managed to come up with a name for someone, and I like it. Thank you for this," she said. It was the first time he'd ever used her name. She laughed.</p> <p>"What about yourself?"</p> <p>"I'll take that as a compliment."</p> <p>"Yes, but I'm not sure I will call you that, I'm sure you know what I mean, but thank you for the compliment."</p> <p>"No, I don't. It's just that I'm more used to calling you that, when we meet."</p> <p>"Okay then, and I'll try my best to remember," she said, before turning round and kissing him again. This time she took him by the hand and they went to sit down for a coffee.</p> <p>"How have you been, Alex?" she asked him.</p> <p>"I'm fine thanks."</p> <p>"Have you thought of anyone else?"</p> <p>He couldn't answer right away, and eventually just nodded when he realised she was still leaning in close with her head resting on his shoulder.</p> <p>"I've come to regret letting you sleep over last night," she spoke as she kissed him again and ran a hand through his hair. "I didn't want to scare you off, I just wanted to make sure you were not a virgin when you got home."</p> <p>"Well, I suppose it's a bit better that you aren't, than worrying that you might not have."</p> <p>"Nah, not at all," she chuckled and kissed him on the lips again.</p> <p>"You see?" she asked with a laugh. "You know you're all mine all night long."</p> <p>"Oh, yes, I get some pretty rough stuff in a bit, you know," he replied.</p> <p>"I do. Come on in here and sit down, I've got some things to show you."</p> <p>He followed her into her bedroom to a bed that was a little older than a modern one, but had it's own large double bed with some curtains.</p> <p>She laid out his clothes, before putting on silk stockings over her sexy, high-heeled shoes. He looked at her stockings, then at her legs. She looked at him.</p> <p>"What are you wearing?
