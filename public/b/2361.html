"I'm not sure." I knew I could have been a serial killer, or a serial killer's victim. There had been too many women in that world who could do that, too, and I had been too young to learn how to hunt any woman. "Do you think I could be one?"</p> <p>"So if I came here and killed all your men and then you killed yourself, would you be one?"</p> <p>"I don't know, Sam." I reached my hand out and stroked his cheek. "No, I guess not." He seemed reluctant, but when I felt his hand go to my lower back, I knew he was being sincere. "I didn't do anything," I said, "but you know I want to."</p> <p>He gave me his signature look and it was one of those looks that just said 'fuck you', right? That's what I'd been hearing these last few weeks, those last weeks were so sweet. He looked at me and my smile, he looked right at me, with those eyes, right at me. He reached out a hand, lifted it to my face and brushed his fingers across my lips.</p> <p>"I wouldn't hurt you, do you want me to?"</p> <p>"That's nice, Sam -- not the least bit scary." I reached my right hand out and wrapped his hand gently in my left. Before he could say anything, I turned him around and sat him down on the leather coffee table. I spread my legs and got down on the floor with him before I got on my knees. "Are you sure you want to do this?" I asked, feeling as if I had waited a lot longer than ever before to do this. "I mean, how would you feel if I was a serial killer and you had to take me?"</p> <p>He leaned his face close to mine and began kissing my neck and down to around my collarbones before reaching my bra and pulling it away from me. I reached down with my other hand and held his head while he slid my panties off the hook onto the floor. I smiled slightly as I stood and took off my bra, before I looked down at him and pulled his face down to mine. I parted my lips as he came face to face with me and we kissed.</p> <p>He was soft and warm and the feeling of him was overpowering. It was too much for me to bear, not when I had the chance in hell to be with someone else in that situation. I think that's what scared me most when I met this man. What he felt like. How he wanted to feel it. I was a virgin, and he had promised me that he would be with me. I think what scared me was the pain he and the damage he could cause to my fragile psyche.</p> <p>The next thing I knew, I was being pulled down by this man's arms and laid on my back. I felt a rough stubble and his tongue was rough and warm, but I didn't feel like anyone but myself was touching him. I felt this man on top of me, the strength that comes from being strong enough to kiss someone, a man, and not have them hurt. I felt him climb up my body while I kept my legs and arms on him with my hands. When he was near my breasts my arms came around his back and held him closer. I can't even have words from how warm and comfortable I felt.</p> <p>He lifted his head from between my breasts and looked at me for a moment before he kissed me gently on the lips. I smiled and kissed him back. God, if I got away with this, I'm afraid the guy would be able to go on forever. "I promise."</p> <p>He pulled back a little from me and then slid down my legs. He pushed my knees apart and started licking my thighs around my pussy, while pulling the skirt up out of reach of my hands. I felt more than heard him go down on me, but at the same time, I felt the tingling surge through my body like electricity. When his tongue made contact, I felt it touch my pussy and I jumped a little. I wasn't sure if it was from the feeling of his tongue sliding all over my hot cunt, or from the feeling my face was pressed into the carpet. I'm not sure what made me, as some kind of wild beast.</p> <p>I just closed my eyes and waited for the tickling feeling to dissipate, but the tickling only went on when his tongue was back in my pussy and it was like this for at least five minutes or more. I don't remember how he kept it going, but it was something I had only seen in porn movies. What came over me as he ate me out at that moment was pure ecstasy. It was just like the fucking I had read about in one of my pornoâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
