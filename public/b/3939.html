I saw him start to sit down but I stopped him.</p> <p>"This is your last song, baby," I said. "I'm done dancing so you are going to be my guest."</p> <p>His eyes opened and I told him I had to go to the bathroom. "I know, sweetheart, I will be back," he told me as I got up and left the bed.</p> <p>I was still standing in my heels at the door when I heard the shower start up. When he came out of the bathroom it was dark and it reminded me of when I was in high school.</p> <p>"Are you sure?" he asked.</p> <p>"Yes. You don't look too drunk to worry about that, do you?"</p> <p>I felt him walk over and kiss me on the cheek. He stood up with me and we embraced. I was feeling really great tonight and I was really eager to get back to the room. He took my hand and we went to the dance floor. He took some time dancing with me as we watched the other dancers move through the dancers. Even the black stripper looked sexy. When he finished with me, he took me back to the room. I didn't know why but I took that opportunity to give him a little kiss, which I hoped would get him going, which I hoped did.</p> <p>I went into the bathroom and was feeling really good about the way things had been going. I was horny and I didn't want it to end. As we were finishing our shower, I started to get a little horny myself. The way he was acting just kind of made my pussy wet. If he hadn't stepped out of the bathroom I may have walked right over to him, probably walked right over to the window.</p> <p>We started down the hallway. Since we were in an open area I was able to walk on my toes a little to let him see up my skirt as I walked. I was sure he would give me a good view of my butt cheeks, which looked as if they were trying to pop out of the top.</p> <p>When we walked into my room, we were both sitting on the bed waiting for him. He had stripped down and was laying on his back on the bed. When I looked him in the eyes he was smiling and his cock was getting hard again. I took off my heels and he rolled over on his stomach. When he did I bent down and kissed him. This time our lips parted and I began kissing him with all of the passion of that first kiss. It felt so amazing. I opened my mouth and he kissed me so well and I melted in his arms.</p> <p>As our kissing continued I moved down to his chest and started to suck his nipples. He pulled my head up to meet his mouth and we kissed again. He was still so hard it was nearly painful. All of a sudden, he stopped and said, "I need to go to the bathroom. Take off my shoes."</p> <p>I looked at him and reached my hand down to my pussy to make sure I had a little self-confidence and was still a step ahead of him. It was a step to go the next step, but I was still surprised when he took and pulled off my shoes. I looked at my pussy and thought my pussy was just as wet it had been from his kissing and kissing. I started to tell him that he could put his cock in me by now but stopped myself.</p> <p>Instead, he grabbed a pillow and told a couple of people to go away for a minute and went back into the bathroom. After the few minutes he left, all I could do was look at him and wish that he had just said the loudest "damn that kiss" and that I had given into him.</p> <p>When he came back out of the bathroom he had a robe hanging over a towel in the corner and I was about to ask him why when I saw it was just one of my nightstands. I was about to call the whole thing off when he said, "No, I am not going to answer that, but please go with me. I just wanted to grab your handbag."</p> <p>"Okay, honey," I replied.</p> <p>He looked over at all the clothes that they had laid out on the bed and took a seat next to my bed. I sat there waiting for him to pull on his robe. He finally came to me and asked me, "So where am I going with all this?"</p> <p>"The hotel has an ocean view. You don't have to worry if you are really tired. I have a couple of blankets in my bag. I'll take it back to the room by my bed. The sheets are fresh from the day before so I will need them after you go to bed.
