She was in the front seat with the doors mostly closed, so I slid around behind, got out and sat down. Without thinking or looking at her, I opened the door and slid behind her seat. I put my arms around her waist and held her tight against me as I kissed the nape of her neck. She moaned and leaned back against my arms, moaning. I slid one hand down inside her shirt and felt her breasts. Firm and warm and the nipples were hard and erect.</p> <p>"I think someone's enjoying themselves as much as I am. Let's go inside." I reached for the keys and started the car. The car was already spinning and it didn't take long before we were out of the county driveway and to the motel. We parked the car and I went to the room. It was very cozy and I didn't care about the mess from the night of passion. That, and the shower I'd gotten all night was done.</p> <p>I followed her in with her on the phone. We started a conversation about the way things looked at the office, what a mess we'd made, and other mundane things we'd discussed. She told me about two women that she'd worked with before coming to work. One, she'd called me up to let me know they'd left him and the other was one of the most powerful people she'd ever met. I told her about a friend of mine in the legal world and she got a funny look in her face. Finally, she got off the phone and I got into the bed.</p> <p>After a couple of minutes I'd gotten tired and my body was a bit fuzzy. My mind went a million miles an hour and I wasn't sure I was just tired. I opened my eyes and sat up. The room was still dark. I got out of bed and put on my dress shirt, which I didn't bother to button and left on.</p> <p>I got back up and she was lying face down on the bed. Her top had slipped down revealing her breasts. They were large and I noticed that her nipples were hard and as erect as I'd always seen. Her bottom was slightly pulled back and was partially revealed. I leaned over and took one breast into my mouth. She started gasping, which only increased my desire and need to taste her breast. I started with her nipple, which I took into my mouth and sucked. I gently nibbled it with my teeth. Her moans got louder and she started lifting her hips up. Her arms went through my hair as I rolled her hard nipple around with my tongue. She was moaning and I felt her body squirm and twitch all around by her hips. I slid my hand down to her pussy and felt her soaking wetness.</p> <p>Her moans started escalating and she started pulling her knees up. I looked up and she was moaning and her body had that desperate look I found so sexy. I moved a little lower down and she opened her legs as she spread herself. Her hair looked like a dark red curtain. I looked up at her face and saw that she didn't seem to notice my eyes. Again I had a desire to taste her.</p> <p>I slid a finger inside the folds of her pussy and immediately felt the heat and wetness. I slid it up and down on her clit in slow circles and she moaned and writhed. I began moving my finger in and out of her while I sucked and licked her nipple. She started shaking her head and her lips parted slightly. I continued to suck her breast, which I loved feeling on my tongue. I started to feel her getting hot again. There was an urgency and urgency, but I didn't want to hurry up. I knew I wanted to pleasure her and make her climax for herself, so I slowed down. I was getting more and more turned on as I wanted this woman to orgasm for herself.</p> <p>Instead, I kept licking her, and fingered her, and kissed her breasts as I fingered her. Her body stiffened and I felt her whole body tighten. It was then she pulled her knees back and locked her legs around my head. She arched her back and screamed her orgasm as I felt her wetness splash against me. It was so intense, so intense and such a turn-on. I thought a little of her orgasm in the shower and her orgasm while having sex with her friend earlier, but now was her own climax, it would all be a release and it would be an experience that she would never forget. It seemed to me that she had the ability to make the orgasm more intense than one orgasm made with her friend. She released her legs and her feet slipped off the bed. It was the first time she'd made sex for real.</p> <p>My hand was stillâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
