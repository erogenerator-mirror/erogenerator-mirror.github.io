He then bent over to kiss her, running his lips over hers, then over her chest, until he found her soft, pert flesh and began to suck it hard.</p> <p>She reached between them and grabbed his raging hard-on, and began to stroke him. He pushed her down on the bed and layed down next to her, still licking her breasts. He lifted his lips from hers, sucking them in his mouth, then letting go to the valley between.</p> <p>She looked up at him like he was some god now, her mind racing with thoughts. What if he just fucked her in the worst way? What if he tried to get into her heart? What if she had to do it?</p> <p>There was nothing she could think of to say about what had just happened. It was impossible to imagine anything that would be considered wrong. All she felt was desire and need and need. It was her whole life she had never considered it. Only now it was too late to think.</p> <p>She looked up at the huge erection now jutting out before her. If this was what was to come it was going to be very good and it wasn't going to be like it had been in her life. He was going to need help and she had it all planned out. If nothing else, she would never have done anything that would have caused him to break her in two.</p> <p>All she had done was have sex with him and then the only thing ever going to happen between them was their own actions.</p> <p>She wanted to feel how it would feel like to feel a huge penis filling her vagina, just like he had filled her so well. It had been so erotic and exciting to feel him sliding in and out of the walls of her tight wetness. She felt so full and stretched and filled and she wanted nothing more than to hold him there, to feel him thrusting within her until there was nothing left but complete and complete emptiness.</p> <p>She raised her thighs as more and more of him became visible, taking him further into her. There was little resistance as he began to work around her vulva with his fingers. She arched her back and lifted her hips off the bed as she felt his finger begin to probe her entrance.</p> <p>He then slowly, gradually began to penetrate her. It was so wet and her juices seemed to be pouring out of her, and that wonderful feeling spread quickly throughout her body. He began to withdraw his finger, just leaving it there, feeling the walls of her vagina squeeze it when he pressed against her, pulling her around as he thrust the whole of his finger inside her. His movements seemed to become more and more frenetic as his finger moved in and out of her.</p> <p>He began to go a more frantic pace. As she lifted her hips to meet his strokes, he withdrew his finger entirely and then slammed it back into her.</p> <p>She was gasping and moaning with the intensity of it. And as he began to thrust harder against her, as deep inside her as he could, as his finger continued to penetrate her, she felt another orgasm begin to build. It was a feeling not far away from the one she had experienced, not sure if it could be felt at all. She began to cry out, as she felt herself losing the last vestiges of control.</p> <p>The contractions in her vagina were too powerful and she could not hold back. She climaxed with the full force of her orgasm, but it didn't last long. Her legs came up out straight and her body went rigid. Just having that last orgasm, this one as strong as the one last one before, was too much for her. He had to get away from her, fast or he was doomed.</p> <p>He pulled his finger out in a sudden movement, with her lying face down underneath him, with her legs splayed wide. He moved quickly off the end of the bed, and on to the bed on his back.</p> <p>She scrambled to stand beside him. She turned to look around the room seeing that there were still boxes by the end of the bed. Her legs were a little wobbly and that hurt her. He watched her as she got into the bed under him and then climbed over him to straddle his thighs.</p> <p>As the first wave of her climax subsided he saw another one growing. She was still on her hands and knees and he was just above her.</p> <p>"Please," she begged him. "Please..."</p> <p>She needed his penis inside her where he had been inside her vagina. "Take me," was all he said, and she reached underneath herself to find his penis, still half hard. He had done it himself; she felt guilty about that as she pulled the condom off.</p> <p>He was on his backâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
