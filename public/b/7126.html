The two hours left in the morning, and after a quick shower I checked for my messages and saw that it was after eleven.</p> <p>I took this time to call and tell her what had gone on. I told her to go to bed and wake up at four that night because I had to think. I had to go over everything with her, and to make sure she wasn't mad at me. I was planning on being a gentleman and not calling the police but I had to be a gentleman if I was going to keep our relationship going. The call seemed to run through her mind for some time, she told me she loved me, and didn't want to let anything go to waste.</p> <p>As I said that, I found myself being even more turned on by the thought of her, and I really wanted to come to her, but I didn't know how. On the other hand, I knew I wouldn't be able to control myself from getting hard, but then again, it wouldn't be like I could control myself from not having a sexual relationship. I started thinking about other things in the world other than getting a blow job from her. My thoughts came to a stop when I was greeted by a message from her on the phone. For a minute, there was a silence, and then she began to tell me how much she wanted to make love to me, and that she wanted me to tell her how much I liked her, as it was my first time. She wanted me to tell her how much of a big part of me loved her and wanted to make love to her.</p> <p>My heart stopped. I had to ask, because I was sure I would regret telling her what she had said about me being a big man. It was hard to hear her out of her car, as it was at that moment. My mind started to wonder and see, if it was really her to have asked me how much this felt like her time to think about how much she wanted to make love to me. "That is if it's ok", I told myself. I decided that it would be ok to let her think about me for a minute and to make sure that we didn't do something that I didn't want to do. As this was still only a one time event I was determined to do it, but then again, I didn't want to ruin the good feeling I felt just from her talking to my earlobe.</p> <p>After a short discussion, I told her that I was going to be in town on business and would call in later in the day. She asked if I was going to meet her at her apartment, and I told her that was fine and that I really didn't have to work until the morning and that I would just hang out and watch tv. About an hour into the conversation, I found myself reaching for her hand and pulling her off the couch.</p> <p>Her hand started shaking, and she just pulled my hand onto her. "It's ok," was all she said as she broke our grip and pulled me close to her. I stood there for a few seconds just looking at her, holding onto her and hoping she didn't have any diseases. She smiled and looked me in the eyes and said "I just got home from work, and had some stuff to take care of, you have all the time in the world." With that she kissed me and whispered: I am in love with you, I mean that, I am in love with you."</p> <p>I couldn't believe what was happening to me, but at the same time I was glad it wasn't my girl's fault that she had been so stupid as to give me the opportunity to be with her. With that, she pushed me back toward her bedroom and as she stepped out into the living room, she pulled me by my hand and headed me and down the hall to her bedroom. As she closed the door behind her, I was in shock and not sure if I should pull up the zipper between us, I really didn't want to cause any embarrassment of myself. I didn't want to be the victim of that situation.</p> <p>I was so confused. I didn't know what to think or what to feel and I wasn't sure what to do. I finally gave in and agreed to her demands and walked out into the living room to find my girl standing by the bed, smiling. I stopped right in front of her and kissed her. She kissed me back and we held our hands tight to each other. Her hands roamed all over my body. I turned her around and kissed her again. I didn't say anything because I just wanted to tell her all along what I wanted from her.</p> <p>My girl broke from us and we lay down on her bed for quite a while. Our hands roamed over body and mine found the spot just below her breastâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
