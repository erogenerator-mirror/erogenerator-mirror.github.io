It's a very long story and I thought I should tell you some of it, before you decide to see me."</p> <p>"Well, I guess you made an impression, eh?" He said, smiling as she blushed bright red.</p> <p>"No, thank you." She grinned and then blushed deeply again, "It's just hard not to say I love it here, but I really need to have someone take me to lunch."</p> <p>He was silent for a moment and then he looked at her and smiled, "We might as well go. It's almost like we used to go to the same place several times now."</p> <p>She looked around at the people in line at the food court and saw them looking at her and smiling warmly. Then she smiled and kissed him lightly on the lips and he said, "Thank you."</p> <p>She walked slowly out to the car, still trying to hide her embarrassed expression. The two men looked at each other knowingly.</p> <p>"This was amazing!" she whispered, finally looking over at him.</p> <p>"Thank you." He replied as she slipped in the driver's seat and he drove home.</p> <p>When they pulled up he looked at her and said, "So, what do you do, when you're working?"</p> <p>"I'm an electrician."</p> <p>He smiled at her for a moment, then said, "You just have to go back home to school. Then you can come back here and stay there until you get the job with the electric shop back."</p> <p>"No problem!" she replied, and then smiled at him, "What do you do?"</p> <p>"Electrical engineer."</p> <p>"What do you do?" she replied.</p> <p>"Electrical systems. I'm a tech consultant. I think it helps take care of some of the jobs that are coming."</p> <p>"I've never heard of a tech consultant." She smiled at him, then added, "Well, that's not entirely true. In fact, I'm an engineer myself and I like to work a lot, as long as it doesn't involve getting involved with the customers."</p> <p>"Are you in college?" he asked her, and she saw that he had taken a moment to look over the map of the city which she'd seen on the map.</p> <p>"No. I'm an engineering student. I'm working my way up here." She smiled at him. "Where's Mom?"</p> <p>"School is out for the weekend. But I've got some free time and my wife and kids are going to be gone for a week." He replied. "There's a small apartment in the back and I'll be spending the weekend in bed."</p> <p>After that he said, "I'm sorry if we can't keep our hands off of you. It's very nice to meet you. When can you start?"</p> <p>She grinned at him and said, "When you're ready."</p> <p>"Oh, I'm ready now." He smiled. "I've never actually done it."</p> <p>"It sounds like you're nervous." She smiled, holding her hand out to him.</p> <p>"That would be a lie. I'm actually very nervous. Here on the plane, it's so much better to just relax and enjoy yourself." He grinned back as she stepped up to her side and said, "But of course, I'll have to start right away this weekend."</p> <p>"I can't promise that." He said, smiling at her cheekily as he pulled the door open and stepped out. She shook her head and then looked out the small window, seeing a pair of buildings come into view and a line of buildings stop just outside her car. "You're right." She smiled, looking up at him as he pulled on his beltless jeans. "You're right."</p> <p>She shook her head and said, "I'm pretty beat sometimes. Do you have a car?"</p> <p>"Do I drive this time?" he asked her, and her expression changed to surprise as she looked at him.</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>His smile broadened. "I have a lot of my people here. Why don't you come in when its time to check it out?"</p> <p>She nodded quickly. "OK." She said, and he put on his jacket and she followed him. He opened the door for her and when she walked into the empty garage, he glanced at her and she saw the disappointment in his eyes.</p> <p>"Where's Mom?" she asked, and he walked around her, his eyes glancing down at her.</p> <p>"In here." He said as he walked over to the small desk in the office, and then came back to her. "Sit down."</p> <p>She smiled at him as he sat down in the desk chairâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
