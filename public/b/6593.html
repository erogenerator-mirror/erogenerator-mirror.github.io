I'm almost there!" She wiggled her ass and then said, "Now hurry and fuck me, baby! Give it to me!"</p> <p>His hands ran up and down her smooth, tan legs. He grabbed a fistful of her long, curly black hair and pulled back making her wince a little. He continued to fuck her hard making her moan like a whore. This position worked for her too because there was no more friction; it was more of a massage. He used his arms and his shoulders to keep her butt high in the air. The friction made her pussy flow faster; she was already in a very sexy place. They moved in unison for a little while. They had started to perspire with excitement. She could feel the first trickle of cool air on her back as the friction was increasing. It was all too much. She could feel her body building up the heat that she had been experiencing for the last hour.</p> <p>'Fuck! Now I am! Please now!' she thought. Her orgasm hit her like a freight train. She had never come twice in that short time. She had never been with a boy like him. It was like a fire had gone out of her. There were three powerful explosions of pleasure.</p> <p>The first landed on her ass and the second on her stomach. The third squirted on her belly. The fourth was on her nipple which was already hard like a pea. The fifth, sixth and seventh went on her face and lips.</p> <p>"Fuckkkk," she moaned.</p> <p>"Good God," she thought and looked back and see a stream of thick, gooey, gooey goo landing on her head.</p> <p>He got out of her and laid down beside her. She turned around on her side looking at him. She could feel his large erection pressed against her back. He rested his hand on her right thigh. She didn't say anything. She just smiled. He got up and got a glass of ice. They sipped, and then he asked, "So how was shopping?"</p> <p>"The mall was awesome," she said. She felt the hot, wet sensation on her legs.</p> <p>He handed her a drink and went to the bar. She opened the door to the liquor store to get the liquor. He came back to her, "Did you have fun? It is about time I was getting back to town."</p> <p>"Yes, it was fun," she said.</p> <p>"You have a beautiful body, but now I want you to get naked. You have a beautiful body." he said. She looked at him and felt him get on the bed and pull her arms out and tie them to the bed post. Her nipples were hard and erect. She was now totally naked except for a thong that clung in place to her wet pussy. She felt a little ashamed but also very turned on to feel this way.</p> <p>He came and sat on the bed between her legs. He looked at her and said, "Your body is very sexy," as his hand moved to her right breast and he held it. She was very turned on and her breath was coming in gasps. His fingers moved downward and touched her pussy lips. He slid his middle finger along her wet crevice which made her shiver. Her body began to quiver as he rubbed along her slit.</p> <p>"Ohh. It's so wonderful!" she thought. "I think my pussy belongs to you."</p> <p>He rubbed her clit and kissed her. One hand held her cheek while the other finger played with her clit. She began to rub against his finger. He pulled them away and then slid them in his mouth so they were good and wet. He kissed her and she could feel his warm, moist tongue lapping at her pussy. He slid a finger around her labia, inside her, and wiggling it around while his tongue massaged her.</p> <p>"God I want your cock," she thought. She thought it was going to feel as wonderful as his finger slid around her pussy. She could feel her body respond. His finger sliding over her erect nub made her go crazy. She felt her own body begin to twitch, it was as if she could feel it everywhere on her body. It was as if there were electrical lines all along her body. She was totally out of control with her body and mind.</p> <p>She was on fire and her legs trembled. He slid his fingers out of her pussy and used his lips to hold her mouth still. Their faces moved so that she could see his face.</p> <p>Her mind was racing with all kinds of erotic thoughts and all of them were happening at the same time. She had never been this sexually excited before.
