Finally he pulled back to look into her face.</p> <p>'You're crying, are you sure?' He asked her.</p> <p>'Yes,' she said again.</p> <p>'Do you want to go home?'</p> <p>She nodded.</p> <p>'We can stay here tonight. Or on the couch, if you prefer.'</p> <p>She nodded again. 'Okay,' she smiled.</p> <p>He watched her pull on some clothes and run to the bathroom.</p> <p>**</p> <p>He got up from the couch and walked toward the front door. He knocked on the outside, but nobody answered.</p> <p>He knocked on the other door. As it opened and he heard voices in the house, he pulled back and ran back to his own house. The voice of the woman that lived next door told him it was her and that she wanted it. He walked over to his car and backed out of the driveway. When he got to the street, he turned off the car and walked up the back steps to his truck. He pulled up in front of the house, got in and started the truck. He got a beer and sat back in his truck.</p> <p>The woman climbed out of the back of his truck and walked up the stairs to his house. She turned back and took a deep breath. She walked up the stairs and up a flight of stairs to his bedroom.</p> <p>The woman opened her side door and stepped inside. She saw the bed and walked over.</p> <p>He was on her.</p> <p>He pulled her to him and she moaned in surprise when he kissed her. It felt good for both of them and she melted into him. He ran his hands over her thighs slowly as he pulled her body closer to him. He pressed his lips against hers, their tongues probing the others. She moaned as he pulled away. A hand found his hardness and squeezed it. He pulled back from her.</p> <p>'Let's go in the bedroom,' she said.</p> <p>She turned and led him quickly into the bedroom. They quickly undressed each other then fell onto the bed. They quickly lay in each others arms as they explored each other. Her naked body writhing against his naked body as he lifted her legs and put them over his shoulders. Her hands were clutching at his arms as he kissed her stomach and her hips. She groaned as he sucked a nipple into his mouth. She sighed as he sucked on it. He kissed down her belly, stopping to tease her navel. She cried out when he kissed it and licked it lightly. He pulled down his shorts and straddled her as he licked her thigh and kissed at her other thigh. He looked into her eyes as he kissed around her and slid his cock between her legs.</p> <p>She pushed hard against his body, pulling him forward. His body slid easily between hers.</p> <p>She opened and opened his legs then wrapped them around his ass. He slid his hands under her and grabbed her breasts. He slid his hands up her sides then circled her neck while thrusting forward. He leaned against her as he thrust into her belly. He held her as he rode against her. She came again several times before he kissed her and they rolled to their sides, kissing and touching. He pulled the blankets off of her and her body relaxed against his.</p> <p>'We're sleeping naked,' she said as she slid against him.</p> <p>He wrapped his legs around her then moved over her and lay on top of her. It was the start of a wonderfully romantic, intimate dream.</p> <p>They went back to sleep.</p> <p>**</p> <p>The next morning, they were up early. He checked his messages. After a breakfast of eggs, bacon and toast, they showered and went into the shower. She was on her side as he lathered up her body. She moaned as he ran his hands all over her body, washing her hair, washing down her legs. He massaged her arms, belly and thighs as he finished her off. When he finished her, he took hold of her and lifted her. He pulled her down so she was on her back and positioned her head with her arms over her breasts. Her head hung over the edge as he kissed his way down her body until he was on his knees above her. He bent forward to kiss her while he pushed his cock into her cunt.</p> <p>She arched her head back giving him easier access to her mouth. He slid all the way into her as she moaned her pleasure. She pushed her pelvis up to him meeting him. She raised her arms to wrap her hands around his neck, then back to grip his neck as she met him with her hips.</p> <p>She wanted to be in control. He wasn't. She moved her hands back up to his shoulders as she pushed back. She wanted him to fuckâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
