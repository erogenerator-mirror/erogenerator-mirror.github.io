"So, you think you can tell me everything?"</p> <p>"Absolutely." I responded. After a minute of standing there, she walked up to me and gave me a deep, sexy kiss. Her hands moved up to cup my breasts, and she pulled my shirt up to expose my nipples. I threw my arms around her neck, pulled her tight against me, and our tongues quickly started dancing their way inside each other's mouths. Our mouths moved together, caressing tongues from the deepest reaches of our souls, until we were barely aware of our surroundings. My hips were moving in sync with hers, moving back and forth against her, feeling the fullness of her as we kissed each other. We broke our kiss long enough to stare at our hands still on each other, then we both let out a moan of lust and desire.</p> <p>"How do I taste?" she asked.</p> <p>"Absolutely delicious." I replied. She turned her body around, and slowly slid down my clothes while whispering in the ear of my lover. "Are you ready to eat?" she whispered.</p> <p>"Absolutely." I responded, as she pulled off my shirt and unhooked my bra. "I want to see my tits." I told her. She looked up at me with a look of hunger. "You can eat them, if you want to." I told her. She kissed her way from my left breast to my ear, then licked and nibbled on it a little before kissing her way to my right. She continued to whisper in my ear, telling me how much she loved my breasts. I arched my back a little as she rubbed her fingers into my body. I loved how her touch sent electric jolts throughout my whole body, and even though I kept looking at her in the eyes, I could feel my arousal growing in my sex.</p> <p>"Let's find out what else tastes better." she said. As she moved down with my body, I removed my shirt while she unhooked her pants. As I dropped her pants to the floor, I moved up to her, kissing her as I continued south to her stomach. She moaned softly and her hips started to grind on the hardness of my own. I grabbed her ass and pulled her tight to me. She responded by digging her nails into my ass and pulling me close to her. "This is called 'eating,' so you want it rough don't you?" she whispered.</p> <p>"Absolutely." I answered as I knelt down between her legs and licked up her right thigh. When she felt something different, she thrust her hips towards me. I was a bit surprised as she moved her hips around on her own accord, but it was a slow process. Finally, I stuck my tongue inside her leg and made a circle around her clit. She moaned loudly. I then sucked her clit into my mouth, pressing in a little bit of pressure while moving my tongue up and down the length of her. My eyes stayed connected with hers, and I felt her hips move on a little more. I moved my hand down and took her clit into my mouth, swirling my tongue over and around her clit and making the rest of her tingle. As she came down from it, I moved my hand so it was between her legs and pressed it as far inside her as it would go. As I did this, I moved my tongue and finger around in her pussy trying to add a small amount of motion to make it more erotic. As she started to come down a bit, I got out of my way. I knew she needed this. And she had no idea. "I love the way you taste and how you moan." I said. She opened her eyes and kissed me forcefully, her tongue darting deeply into my mouth. "I can always wait a bit longer." she said. I smiled and crawled down her body. I licked up all the juices from her, and moved my head down to her clit. Her hips moved off the bed as she felt her first sensation of a tongue. I looked up, as her face screwed up from the pleasure. "Don't stop now." she begged. With that, I took her clit into my mouth and sucked it in and gently pulled back until the sensitive area was exposed for my tongue to touch. I worked my tongue around for a few moments, and then worked it back down again. As I did that, I pushed three fingers inside her and moved the fingers around, making a circular motion as my mouth and mouth covered her most sensitive spots. She was making long and deep moans, and my own, as she was coming up from a high. Her hands moved to my head as she moaned and rocked from the waves of pleasure that hit her, and it gave her the most pleasureâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
