I will now turn off the light and I will start dinner." I said as I grabbed my suitcase.</p> <p>"Oh that would be great. I can help you prepare the meal. Thank you again." She said turning to go into the bedroom.</p> <p>"You can stay and help me in a day or two." I said giving her a kiss.</p> <p>"Thank you again." She said kissing me back, but giving me nothing with it.</p> <p>When she was in bed, I was making love to her from behind while I kissed her neck, earlobe, and back. When I got her turned on, I slid inside and fucked her slowly. We were making out like little teenagers that have not been kissed for a long time to savor her. Her arms were around me so tight I couldn't keep my hands off her body. I started to build to the same orgasm that I had just had, as when we were fucking, we turned around and I fell on her, kissing her and she kissed me back. She knew my orgasm was near, she stopped kissing me and rolled me over so she was on top. She lifted her leg over my cock and sat down slowly making me enter her again. She leaned back, her chest heaving and looked at me. "I want you to fuck me hard and deep tonight." She said with a big smile on her face.</p> <p>My hard shaft was sliding back and forth in her, her hands were on my chest, pushing and pushing me in deeper each time. I had to tell her to fuck me hard while I watched this movie on the television.</p> <p>"Please don't stop." I said, knowing that she was more than willing to do just that.</p> <p>I could tell that she was getting close to orgasm again, because she started to ride me faster. It drove me crazy with desire and I started to thrust up into her harder. Her body shook and shook as my cock slipped out of her. "Give me your cum so I can feel it." She said as she reached up and took hold of my dick. "Cum in my hand." She whispered in my ear as it shot out of me.</p> <p>We lay together for ages and before we knew it, we were kissing each other as we fell back onto the bed. We rolled over and fell asleep like that.</p> <p>I woke up with her legs around me, she was pulling me into her as she reached orgasm as I was still inside her. I could feel her pussy milking the rest of my hardness out. We lay there for a while, just enjoying the feeling before turning around.</p> <p>"It is getting late." She said. "We better get to work then."</p> <p>"Yes I am a busy man, don't want to be late for dinner." I said as we kissed.</p> <p>We got up off the bed and cleaned up and did our business as she got dressed leaving. We were just about to head to take a shower and I kissed her before we left the bathroom,</p> <p>"Good night." I said, turning on the light.</p> <p>She gave me a long deep kiss. "Good nightâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
