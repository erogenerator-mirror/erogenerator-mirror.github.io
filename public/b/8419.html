Finally he was coming out of the bath, and she stood in the doorway naked... and there were the sounds of their coupling. It was all so erotic - the hot shower, wetness in her hand, the sound of wet hair. Then from the bathroom door, she heard a man's voice - "Oh, oh, oh" - a man's name.</p> <p>She couldn't take anymore - the image in her mind of her hand rubbing herself against that man, and the look on his face as he came. Then she saw the look, and she moaned. He saw that, too and he gave her a kiss. She kissed him back and then he stepped close to her. She could smell a musky scent of his skin. He kissed her neck - he felt good, and he didn't stop her.</p> <p>Then - she felt a hot mouth against her nipple, and she moaned. He bit her a little, and then released it. She felt herself blushing. She hadn't ever been with another man at all - other than her husband.</p> <p>He had her back in the tub with him, and they kissed and cuddled and touched again. She kept thinking what it would be like to lick a man's cock, to suck him and taste more of him, to be dominated and used again...but she didn't dare. The hot water was getting to her now, and if one of the sounds she was making - it was enough to bring her over the edge. Her hand reached down to her pussy and she fingered herself. She came with a scream. He saw her eyes looking at him, and she saw him smiling. He grabbed her as he walked towards her and kissed her there.</p> <p>She looked at him - the look was a little scary, but she didn't care. He kissed her again, deep. She wanted it all, all of it - she felt his tongue on her tongue, her taste on his lips.</p> <p>He turned her around and she started to slide towards the bed, but he pushed her firmly back down. She turned to the side, facing him, and he kissed her passionately. His cock was already hard, and she could see it glistening with her own wetness. It was thick, but not nearly as thick as her husband's cock had always been. She kissed him as they kissed. Her tongue reached down again and this time he held it there, his fingers stroked the sensitive skin. She moaned and he smiled. She felt his hand slide towards her pussy - the feel felt so good, and she closed her eyes to watch him.</p> <p>He slipped his fingers into her - her mouth opened, but he was still kissing her. He put him hand between her legs - she was slick - and his fingers slid smoothly inside her. He slid them back and forth as he fingered her. She reached down and felt his cock. She was soaking wet. It felt good. It felt hard... it didn't hurt so much as it made her feel sexy to have him inside her. She reached up and put his cock in her mouth, and she took him in.</p> <p>He thrust himself in and out of her mouth. Her eyes were closed, she was tasting herself. He pushed his tongue back into her mouth, and she took it again. He slid his fingers in and out, while he leaned in just a little, moving them around in her warmness. She sucked on them, and then he slid them around her clit again, and she moaned again, this time louder. He did this a few more times - she came and she felt him - wetness in her, on her stomach, and then all over her tits.</p> <p>"I want you to eat me".</p> <p>She turned her head, and he lifted her - his cock was right in front of her face. It stood erect between his legs, a good 8' and almost as wide as her husband's cock... she licked her lips. He leaned a bit closer - she knew he had taken off the bathrobe when she was done, but it didn't take her an instant to remove it completely. It was just enough for her lips to touch it, to feel it pulsate and she kissed it... and then she sucked on it. He moved away from her as she was, and then she saw him. He was looking at her. She looked down at his face, and she watched the lust in it as well as the desire for it.</p> <p>He moved his cock back and forth between her lips, coating them in her wetness - she was dripping and dripping - as his face was closer and closer to hers. She couldn't take it any longer. He wanted her too, and he wanted her.</p> <p>He sat astride her chest. He pushed her breasts togetherâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
