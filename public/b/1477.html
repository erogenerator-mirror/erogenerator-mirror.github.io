I try to be as gentle as I can, trying not to hurt her, and try to ease her back down onto the bed. She responds to me by taking my shoulders and gently squeezing down. She then relaxes, and I start to ease her back up to her stomach.</p> <p>When I slide back around to her side of the headboard, I start taking off my clothing, before leaving her legs hanging off the bed. She's still on the bed, but she looks more relaxed.</p> <p>"Wow, that was an interesting experience."</p> <p>"Thanks."</p> <p>"What was it that you were trying to do?"</p> <p>"Just a really good massage."</p> <p>"Why does it have to mean something to me?"</p> <p>"I'm guessing that it'll mean something to you."</p> <p>"I hope so."</p> <p>After a few moments, I move back around to the foot of the bed and slide back to the head. She's lying in bed, but I'm not about to lie there and try to play it cool. I start slowly, starting at her foot, working my way up her left leg. The feel of her skin gets to me instantly. It's nice and warm, and when I move up to her thigh, I lean down a little and give her a nice, soft rub up and down with an ever-increasing pressure. We both let out a soft sigh.</p> <p>"You're very nice."</p> <p>"You're very, very nice."</p> <p>So I let my hand slide up to the bottom of her foot. I start rubbing her calves as I continue to massage her thighs. Her foot is really tight, and I had to use both of my hands quite often to help myself glide up and down her leg. The feel of her bare skin against me, and the smell of her body all around me, is really doing it for me. I lean in again, starting to kiss her upper thigh. She doesn't seem to mind. She's lying there with her legs still hanging off the bed, and I begin to move further up her thigh.</p> <p>She moves her feet up with mine a little, and I work my way up to her feet, gently caressing them with both hands, and finally I start to slowly work my way up from her ankles to her toes. As I start to move up higher, and when her legs start to arch higher, and I'm a little closer to her pussy, I can feel the wetness starting to run over her thighs and down her legs. When I reach her knee, I give it one last push and start moving back down, this time around her knee, where I start to work myself back up her thigh toward her pussy. By the time I'm over her thigh, she's completely out of it. She's lying with her legs spread wide open. Her feet are still hanging off the bed, and now they turn her entire body. I'm a happy guy, after what we just shared. I keep working my way up her thigh, slowly. She's moaning now, her body squirming a bit, but she's relaxed. She looks back over at me, her eyes begging me to touch her. I start working my way back down her leg, but now I've got to look again to see what she's enjoying. I can see that she's definitely getting into the idea, as she's almost ready to come. I'm enjoying myself a little bit too, it's a little different to have her just a little bit worked up, but I kind of like it.</p> <p>I'm going back up to her legs now, and this time, again, I'm going to give the entire upper thighs of her legs, and it definitely doesn't feel like she's about to get it. I'm starting to move up her legs again. It's only a tiny distance from her center. After I work myself up to the top of her inner thighs, I just work her legs back down. I'm really enjoying working on her, but I keep my hands on her upper body, letting her come as far as I think she'll stop herself. She's so relaxed now, her body is shaking a bit, but I'm not sure whether it's because of the feel of her legs, or because I'm just working her legs.</p> <p>Eventually I get to her center, and it's time I had a feel of her. I move up slowly, not putting too much pressure on the right places, just taking my time to let my fingers slide down the side of her pelvis. Once I'm near her pussy, I can feel her body shivering. I can't say whether it's because of what I'm doing to her or the incredible sensation my hands are causing, but if I was on a plane I wouldâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
