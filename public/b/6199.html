He asked.</p> <p>"Oh no, I wouldn't have brought you this far." I said honestly. But I wasn't going to tell him that. I was having fun playing the game as long as I was playing it safe.</p> <p>"What makes you think I'm here to cheat on you?" He smiled in response.</p> <p>"I didn't come here to have sex with you." I said looking back to the door again.</p> <p>"I already thought of giving you a ride home from school." He said smiling at me again.</p> <p>"No, really." I said standing up. "I'm going home for a while for some alone time."</p> <p>"Oh, no, we were going to make out." I said moving to walk back to him but he pushed me back into his room.</p> <p>Looking back at me he said, "But of course, we'd be here right?"</p> <p>"No, we're not going to a motel." I said still protesting. He turned and left me standing by the door with my hand in my mouth. I just stood there waiting for him to say something.</p> <p>He looked back one more time, "Why didn't you just fuck me? You know you want my big cock in you. But if that wasn't enough of a turn on for you, why didn't you just go home with me?" I didn't even say yes. I just stood there watching him walk away leaving me feeling ashamed when he left me standing there still holding my wrist.</p> <p>I looked around as much as I could in my new home so I could make sure I wasn't alone in the house. So I went back in and sat down on the couch as quietly as I could.</p> <p>When I came back in from my shower, I had a glass of water in my hand but I couldn't get myself calmed down or calm. Instead I had my fingers curled up into a ball and my eyes closed. It didn't help that I could tell I wasn't going to be able to stop myself from crying until he finished, when he was done with me. It didn't help much either.</p> <p>A few minutes later I was curled up on the couch sobbing my eyes out.</p> <p>"What the hell was that? What kind of a fuck was that?" I asked shaking in his presence. It took me a minute to get my head to settle down and start to work.</p> <p>It did help though since my head was still covered in my old man's cum.</p> <p>It wasn't until he came back in and sat down next to me on the couch that I finally took over. As much as it hurt to hear him say, "My god, you're beautiful!" I thought it would only make him want to fuck me more, maybe even make my husband want me a little more. So instead of saying things to shut him up, I simply simply said,"You're sweet." After a minute I said, "Well, I guess I got to thinking I should get dressed and go home if they wouldn't be going to school soon."</p> <p>He laughed saying, "I know, but for me the sex will still be enjoyable."</p> <p>In less then a minute, he was pulling up his basketball shorts that were left hanging at his feet. Pulling them up and the waistband down, he pulled them up as well and let them fall on his feet, then he walked around to his side of the couch and put the seat back in it.</p> <p>"I hate to, but I'm going to have to leave." I said reaching into the recliner and taking out my night stand in case we got caught. "It is not what you think, your father would never allow me going home without getting a spanking."</p> <p>"I know my father would never let you leave without having my cock in you." He replied tossing it on the bed. "Plus, the truth is, you've been taking your pills for several days now and you will not be able to stop if you do anything until you finish, if by any chance you are going to quit and go home."</p> <p>"I won't quit. I still haven't said anything before, and I already got some spanks coming, so I guess I will be alright." I said trying not to cry on the couch.</p> <p>And I'll be alright. I can get this over with or I can stop. I thought and he just nodded at me smiling again. I know he liked the thought of me being spanked and was surprised how hard it was to keep from crying.</p> <p>"Do you think they would punish us for letting all those people come in?" He asked, but all he said was, "No" He turned then and walked back to his room to get himself dressed.</p> <p>"Maybe we canâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
