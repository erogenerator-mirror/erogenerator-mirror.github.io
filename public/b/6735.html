I asked, the tone of my voice betraying my excitement at this request. I was already getting hard again from her attention.</p> <p>"I'm sorry you have to be gone so long, Miss. I can help. But I need to go before mom gets back too."</p> <p>"Sure, come to my room. Now will you be all right?" I asked, trying to get through the water and get back to her.</p> <p>"Fine, I will be fine. By the way, may you help me in the laundry room?" she asked, sounding worried. I knew she would feel safer if she was there and would have an excuse on her way.</p> <p>"I will stay away from you long as possible," I assured her. She smiled at me and turned away to continue on her way. I looked up at the door at my old bedroom to see her smiling before the bathroom door had closed silently and disappeared.</p> <p>I spent the next hour helping myself in the shower before I turned it on in my room. When I was done and had settled down, I turned out the shower and began to towel off as I stared out the glassed-in shower door. I couldn't help but think about the day I had spent with Susan when I had been so horny. For a brief second, I wondered if I would ever be able to be able to have that with her again. After all, I had told her what I was doing at the time anyway.</p> <p>I felt a wave of sadness wash over me as I thought of all the things I had had to tell her. The day before, I had told her how much I enjoyed having sex with her. And though I knew it was wrong and sinful to have sex with someone my own age, I thought it would be better if I told her that too. The things that she had said to me at school and on the phone would be a good memory for both of us and I couldn't remember any of the things we had talked about. However, I had been such a good student and I knew she would know, if she ever came back to me.</p> <p>"Hey, are you in?" a male voice came from the shower door. I turned around and there stood the most beautiful woman I had ever seen. She had on a pair of pink bathing shorts, one that was very short and made her waist seem even shorter than it was. Her top was just to her stomach and came down just a little below her breasts. She had a beautiful face and her legs were completely bare. I felt my heart skip a beat and I stood there admiring her. Her skin was flawless, except for a little bit of dark blonde fuzz on the sides of her face.</p> <p>"Oh, I'm sorry to be interrupting you," I said, "do you want to get in the shower?"</p> <p>"I just wanted to say thanks for spending the day with you. I know it could get very weird at times...but this was, of course, my first time getting ready for my date today," she said, looking over her shoulder at me.</p> <p>"Oh, so I can't wait until I get to see you after the trip," I teased back. "I have to get going, my Mom might come back to take your things."</p> <p>She smiled at me happily and said, "Yeah, we can have a nice dinner when you get back!" I just smiled and closed the shower door. It was a great place to have lunch and I would make a great date with this goddess.</p> <p>When I got back to my room and got dressed, I saw Susan in my parents' room. She was alone, but there was some conversation going on out of the room. I decided to watch some TV, before I got the chance to call it a day and just hang out with the rest of the family. Besides, I needed to clear my head and get some rest. At this point, I wasn't even thinking about Susan. How could she be spending some time with me in my parent's room? She wasn't what I had considered to be my "girlfriend" when I met her. I guess I just got used to it when she had asked me to come in for a minute to talk, rather than hang around. But, I guess she did seem like a nice girl. Perhaps Susan was the one person I could trust and still get along with with.</p> <p>I quickly put on a pair of boxers and grabbed my bag to head out. About 20 minutes after I left my parent's room, my phone rang. As I picked up the phone, I had gotten the courage to do what I had to do.</p> <p>"Hello, this isâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
