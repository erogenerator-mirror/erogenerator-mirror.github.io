I'm going to have to get a lot stronger." He grumbled, but then his voice faded into the background as he walked down stairs to find Gaspai who had come in with a tray he'd made. He plunked down on the couch and pulled her to he corner to sit beside him. "Thank you." She murmured and snuggled into him. Gaspai snuggled up to him and closed her eyes, enjoying his touch and the feel of being in his arms. While her hands weren't tied to it by rope, her feet weren't tied either either by leather ankle restraints he bought for her. She just knew she would be a part of this life, and she already wanted to be a part of it. Their fingers intertwined as they rested on the couch together and she felt his hand move down to her knee where it began to slowly slide higher. Her eyes flew open to take in the feel of his hand pressing against her lower thigh.</p> <p>"I really don't care as long as I can feel you." he whispered and slid over her to wrap his arm around her and spoon. She felt as though she were melting into him, but felt his strength and love. "I love you, Gaspai."</p> <p>"I love you too, Mr. Gaspai." she panted, and her arms went around his neck.</p> <p>***</p> <p>He woke with a start as he felt Gaspai pulling at his tie. She pulled it from his neck and it hung from his collarbone, leaving him feeling like he was going to crawl off the couch and he hadn't done his best to follow them. Her hand slid from his neck over his shirt, pulling it free. She let the garment slide to the floor; then she started to remove Gaspai's own shirt.</p> <p>He heard himself groan and saw her eyes close in anticipation. He stood up, taking his shirt off along the way. He leaned over and ran his tongue over Gaspai's nipple, her face going white as he sucked it gently and ran his tongue lightly over the hard bud, eliciting a low groan of appreciation from her. Her hands came up and found him, pulling him by his shirt at the waist. Their kiss went on for several minutes, as he felt her soft breasts pressing to his chest, and the hardness of her nipples along his. He pulled away from his kiss only long enough to pull Gaspai in for a kiss. She wrapped her arms around his neck, and he moved back to her, placing kisses all over her face. His hands slid up and down the front of her stomach as he continued kissing her the entire time. He began to pull her shirt out of the waistband of his breeches, when he realized she wasn't going to let go.</p> <p>"Why?" he breathed. She moaned and ran her hands down his chest to find his hips. She pressed his waist down to her face as she leaned forward to kiss him lightly again, just as his fingers slid inside her. Her eyes snapped open, and she broke from him long enough to stare at him the whole time. He groaned when her tongue slid over his lips and found his. Her hand reached down to feel his ass in his sleep shorts and she pushed one finger into his hole. The roughness of his body was driving her crazy as she massaged with her finger, and his moans had turned to gasps and she felt her fingers start to stroke inside him. Her mouth opened and they kissed again, her tongue tracing against his, pressing lightly against his. Her other hand snaked its way down onto his cock, stroking and massaging in time with the movement of her fingers. Her other hand came up and grabbed his face, pulling him down to her. They kissed for several moments, before she slid down and he was on his back, his hand sliding between their bodies.</p> <p>Gaspai felt her hips touch his, and lifted herself up on her arms, her wet juices leaking over the head of his cock as she lowered herself over him. Her head began to bob, sucking him into her mouth at the bottom, before sitting back on his stomach to look at him. "Mr. Gaspai..." she moaned as his fingers slid up her slit, sliding into her vagina. She closed her eyes, and moaned softly again as his fingers slid into her. She moaned as her hips moved against him, and he leaned up to kiss her again. This time, she had to make the moves, and her tongue slid into his mouth as he reached up to hold her waist and he lifted her, sliding her back to sit down on his lap with her. She pulled back from his kiss, not bothering to resist any more. Her eyes went wide again as she realized this could easily end asâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
