Maybe more than just having a sex life. There were no strings attached between them. No other way for it to go.</p> <p>Kendra began to slowly walk towards Mike, taking him with each step.</p> <p>Mike didn's to look back. It was time to go on with this. He needed to make the most of this for them. He didn't need to worry about having to share the bed anymore though.</p> <p>Mike began to pick Kendra up and placed her on the bed. She was in the middle of it and could feel his presence in the dim light. She could feel the need for that kind of attention, from a man.</p> <p>Kendra had her back to his front, and took in his presence. There were no plans of being in proximity with him. It seemed as though she wanted to feel his hand upon her.</p> <p>"Your turn, Mikey..." Kendra said as she gently caressed his head.</p> <p>"Ok..." He said as he lowered himself down and put his lips against hers. It was soft and quick, as though he was kissing an angel in her sleep. He closed his own lips around hers and placed his right hand upon her left breast. Kendra had to fight the urge to press her face forward towards Mike's.</p> <p>Mike and Kendra began to kiss, softly at first. They began to make a rhythmic motion. Kendra placed her hands upon Mike's shoulders and pressed herself closer to him. Mike was aware of Kendra's fingers entwining the cloth of her gown. Kendra was not wearing underwear now either, and her breasts pressed against his bare chest. He felt her breath on his neck, and it was intoxicating.</p> <p>After much more kissing Mike began to slide Kendra's gown off of her shoulders, and then off her arms. It had fallen onto the floor as he sat on the bed. He quickly removed it from Kendra and threw it aside. Kendra was wearing a white spaghetti strapped cocktail dress. There was nothing underneath.</p> <p>It looked perfect.</p> <p>Her breasts lay within her black bra, and hung lower than Mike's, but still didn't come close to being as large as hers. Mike's face, however, couldn't help but be drawn to them. Kendra had given him glimpses of her breasts before, and it was only now that he noticed them. Her skin, while not as smooth as they had the first time they would have seen each other, was still perfect. He wondered if she had done this with someone else in the past.</p> <p>Mike slid his hand along Kendra's legs, and began to softly explore them with his hand. He slid a finger along Kendra's panties and pressed it against her already wet pussy. Even through his pants it was as though his finger was sliding in and out.</p> <p>Kendra slowly pulled herself apart, her eyes locked onto Mike's hand as he continued to explore with his, which was now sliding along the outside of her pussy for its own pleasure. Her eyes drifted shut and she began to let out a soft groan. She had the urge not only to touch his hand, but more so to have it caress and caress her pussy. But she knew that she would have to remain silent. No words were necessary. They could both understand that they could both experience their way of life.</p> <p>Kendra could feel Mike's finger inside of her, caressing and playing with her. He began to move his finger in and out, getting a better motion of what he was feeling. Kendra moaned in between soft moans and then she said something so far in advance of him saying "fuck me."</p> <p>"Fuck?" Mike questioned. They both heard Kendra and Kendra.</p> <p>"It's ok," Kendra replied. "My husband..."</p> <p>"Oh don't worry. It's ok," Mike smiled as he removed his hand.</p> <p>"I meant what I said about being quiet," Kendra said. She could feel her heart beating against her rib cage. Mike moved himself onto the bed and began to position her on her knees, her legs spread in front of her chest, her body slightly leaning back. Mike's hand reached her crotch and he began to caress her. Kendra closed her eyes and her mouth opened slightly.</p> <p>"I would do anything to have you," Kendra replied.</p> <p>Kendra slowly lowered herself on the bed and then pushed herself forward towards Mike's hand. "Anything?" she asked.</p> <p>"Absolutely anything from making you orgasm," Mike said as he pulled his cock free.</p> <p>"Really?" Kendra said, staring at Mike's cock.</p> <p>"Sure," Mike smiled, and began stroking himself.
