She threw her purse off the seat and fell forward over it, her face going even bigger as she felt the weight of Mike's body press up on hers and she found herself looking deeply into his eyes and smiling as much as she would have if she hadn't let her mouth stay open.</p> <p>He had leaned down to grab hold of her hair holding it away from her face. He could feel the heat in her face when she looked up just before his eyes were closed. He watched as her teeth scraped at the air as his hand pressed up against her neck and then suddenly he was there, the rest of his body pressing up against hers, his lips crushing hers as she opened her mouth and he slid his tongue between it, gently flicking with the tip as she wrapped her arms around him and moaned into his mouth. She felt his body tightening against hers when he opened his eyes and met hers, his hands slowly beginning to slide up and down the sides of her body with each motion of his hips pressing up against hers.</p> <p>Slowly he lifted the back of her sweater, and when it was about to be pulled her hands quickly went to his back for an unhindered access. He found the hem of the back and slowly drew the material down letting it slip to the floor and she felt the cool material against her bare skin, her stomach tightening with every movement he made as he slid the cotton over her head. Her bra was one small piece, but that was all that she ever wore. She heard him moan softly when she took this off and felt herself quickly blush as she turned to face him. She wanted to feel more of him, to look into his eyes.</p> <p>He slid back down her body, stopping long enough to cup her breast and let his thumb tease over the erect nipple before he pushed her back up onto her seat and stood with his hands on his hips, slowly turning her around so his gaze could drop down to her ass.</p> <p>Even with her bra on he still enjoyed having the soft fabric of the skirt sliding against her skin. Her cheeks bulged in the material of the skirt. She smiled a bit as he leaned down and took her hands, sliding them down over the small of her back to her slender waist. He began to lift the skirt, lifting it just a little higher each time he drew the garment up higher until he could see her tiny cotton thong covered pussy and he raised his arms, the fabric of the thong slipping off and dropping onto the floor to the other seat. He pulled her forward, kissing her deeply as she opened her mouth and slid her tongue into his mouth, their tongues dancing and dancing as she pulled him down until his lips pressed against her ear as she could feel his erection pressed against her. She could feel the heat of the growing bulge in his trousers as his hands slid up her body and under her top until they found themselves holding her in a firm grip, she could feel his erection pressing against her as his grip on her moved down to the bottom of her body.</p> <p>He pushed up the fabric of her thong, exposing her completely, as his hand slid up to push up the skirt. It came down easily on her skin, letting it slide over the soft globes of her buttock. He watched as they came off exposing her pussy and her thighs. His hand continued its journey as they began to kiss once more. His other hand found her breast pushing up against her bra, cupping the firm mound and giving a squeeze that sent sparks of pleasure up her spine.</p> <p>They kissed again as his fingers found her nipple and he pinched it, rolling it gently between his fingers at the same time he started lowering her to the floor. He pushed her toward the edge of the car, her legs sliding over the back of it and she could feel the dampness between her legs as his fingers continued their journey. He slowly slid lower and then slowly slid them back up her body, feeling the dampness of her wetness as he passed it to his fingers. She moaned softly as he gently squeezed her breast, pinching just a bit before lifting up and rolling his hand around her swollen nipple as he felt her body beginning to move up and down just a few inches. They both groaned as his hand cupped down over her breast.</p> <p>Satisfied she had at least an inch or two to go with the skirt, he moved her back so she was standing up. He looked in her face and grinned as he moved himself to the bench seats near the end of the set. He lowered them on his knees, her feet on the leather seats and leaning forward resting her back on the seat, he quickly unfastened the button and slid the zipper of her skirt down. The skirt slipped down her legs, and when she felt the cool seat cover surface against her exposed pussy she was ready for the next stepâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
