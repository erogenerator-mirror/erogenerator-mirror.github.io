I have been very busy since then. Not as busy as I had hoped."</p> <p>I could relate. He seemed like a nice nice guy and in my opinion, very smart. I know that, since then, things were more casual between us, but things went well enough as it is now. So with that in mind, I said, "My wife and daughter do know each other. I'm not sure that anyone would take it further than that."</p> <p>"Why, it was just a matter of time before this happens."</p> <p>"Well, if there was a way, you know. Your daughter was so turned on. I guess some men are turned on by the thought of having the woman they desire."</p> <p>"I hope the right people are on board. Now take another walk."</p> <p>"I'll catch you later then."</p> <p>I gave him my directions to the office before we parted. "I'll make the call in about 20 minutes."</p> <p>"Good."</p> <p>We said good-bye and as I left the office, I thought to myself: "I just hope that this works."</p> <p>It worked very well and I will miss our time together. I have been having the time of my life. I think about her many times a day now. It's such a turn on and is also just the way that I want people to relate. I've always had a crush on her. She was the one who I found attractive and I wanted to take advantage of the fact that she was married to someone else. That's what people would like.</p> <p>I'll make sure that we have the time when we do meet.</p> <p>-o-</p> <p>To be continuedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
