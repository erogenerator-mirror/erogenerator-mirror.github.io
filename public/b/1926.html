"I think it's safer to get married now that everything is out of bounds."</p> <p>It was clear to me that he was thinking about something; anything to get out. My heart sunk. This has to be some kind of wild idea, I thought.</p> <p>"Dad, I really love you, but we have to do something right, don't you think?"</p> <p>My father responded to my words.</p> <p>"I know, sweetheart. Now, would you like to be involved?"</p> <p>"No," I said. "We can stay home now, or you can come with me."</p> <p>"OK, if you want, but it'll cost you the engagement ring."</p> <p>With that he kissed me goodbye, then went inside to his room. I knew it was wrong but I couldn't help it. Why I was so horny? How could I possibly go back to our marriage without getting my life back back on track?</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>I still couldn't believe what had happened so far. It had only taken a week to realize that it had already happened; at least that's what it felt like between us. But now I knew why I was horny, the way I saw it. I really liked this. At least I felt that at times, but this could only be a start.</p> <p>I told my father that I would let him know when I had gone to the mall and would be back, and would be at home, all day Monday. It was only a matter of time before my own father got home.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>It happened so fast. I couldn't stop thinking about it; even over the phone. I just couldn't seem to get it out of my head. I felt my panties growing damp from excitement and frustration.</p> <p>I also couldn't get out of it. I didn't ever want to be in it again, even if I didn't want any kind of relationship.</p> <p>I didn't even want to put the ring on my finger. It wasn't really something that I wanted to do. I just wanted the ring to remind me that something good was there. I just wanted to get out of there.</p> <p>I decided to go get a glass of wine. It was the least I could do, after having done what I had done with the man who had taken my heart. It was the only way. I needed to put my mind back in order. No more fantasies, just the idea of what I was doing.</p> <p>I didn't get home until after midnight. I wondered if I could stay in. I took the elevator down to the lobby and went right back upstairs. At least I could get one more look at that ring, if I could find the courage.</p> <p>As soon as the elevator door opened I entered. My heart was pounding and my mind was racing. I took a deep breath and went to him. He was standing there with a mischievous smile.</p> <p>"Hi, sweetheart," he said as I approached him cautiously, my heart beating frantically in my chest.</p> <p>"Hi, Daddy", I said.</p> <p>"How was your day?"</p> <p>"It was OK, Daddy."</p> <p>"Was it bad?"</p> <p>I took his hands and held them up.</p> <p>"No, it was sweet."</p> <p>"Did you really get excited about it?"</p> <p>"Yes, Daddy," I replied. He didn't resist.</p> <p>"I don't want you to think that I'm a bad father."</p> <p>"I know! I just meant what I was about to tell you, Daddy."</p> <p>"You didn't have to say you weren't excited. I told you that I loved you, too."</p> <p>I went on as if he was speaking for me.</p> <p>"There's a difference between having sex with me and doing it from behind, you know?"</p> <p>He just looked at me, a little shocked.</p> <p>"I'm sorry sweetheart, we were both very close. It was not sex and that's what we want. So please forgive me for being presumptuous. Don't you think that what happened that day was hot?"</p> <p>"Yes, it was, Daddy. I think it was very erotic."</p> <p>"So am I right? Are you sure that you want to marry me."</p> <p>"Yes, Daddy. After the way things went, I would really like to marry you."</p> <p>To begin with I didn't say anything. I was very excited and in turmoil right then.</p> <p>"You know about my fiancée, don't you?"</p> <p>"Yes, Daddy. I'm sure you did, too."</p> <p>"I wouldn't go any further than that, baby."</p> <p>"Then I shouldn't be—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
