He smiled at me, leaned forward a bit, and kissed me full on the lips. I almost came. And then, he whispered, "We're not going to stop for anything."</p> <p>I opened my eyes and looked him in the eyes. A little tear slid down my cheek as if to leave it behind, but thankfully, I couldn't read him. His eyes were smiling and the look on his face told me that, for all other measures, he was a man of the world. I think my last words to him were, "We're not going to stop for anything."</p> <p>We made the best of that briefest movement through the darkness, and then, I was kissing him more passionately than I had for weeks, my tongue darting in and out of his mouth. I knew he felt the soft fullness of my lips as they touched his and I sucked on them gently, pulling him toward me again. My body had become wet; I was soaked. It didn't take long until my head was on his shoulder again and then he stopped; turned me to him and looked into my eyes, our bodies pressed tightly together as we kissed. His hands ran up and down my body as he spoke, "This was the best night I've had all my life."</p> <p>I smiled down at him, kissed him again, and said "I know, you were amazing to me." And we both laughed.</p> <p>We got down a flight of stairs and walked into the waiting area. I held my hand out to one of the guys who had taken my number from me, and we stood in place for a moment, just looking at each other.</p> <p>"Hey, is this the VIP area?" The voice on the line was familiar.</p> <p>"Yes," I responded, almost in a trance, "this is my suite." I turned my body to the blonde guy who gave me his name.</p> <p>"My name is Adam, you owe me."</p> <p>"Adam?" My eyes flew open and my mouth actually dropped in shock. Oh man. That was a new name!</p> <p>"It's Adam. Adam Lacey." I smiled at the guy and shook my head. "I've just found someone else."</p> <p>"Adam Lacey." The blonde guy gave me a wide grin before breaking into a grin. "He's the biggest bitch, ever."</p> <p>Adam and I smiled at each other and then made our way past the line and inside. We were led through the plush living room to an incredible looking fireplace in the back corner of the room. The guys were sitting at the dinner table drinking wine and laughing.</p> <p>"Sit" I indicated the seat down in the middle of the room from where Adam and I were sitting. The guys were all toasting the dinner, but I turned them down, indicating to the other guys the same thing. Finally, the guy who was seated across from Adam gave me his blessing.</p> <p>We started the discussion about the night. Adam was already the top student in his class, as was the man on the other side of us. The professor was there with us, with the two other guys, and the third guy, the one with the two other girls. By the end of the night, all the guys had the same idea; they were the students after all. There was even a round of applause from the first guy, so we knew that it was time to stop this conversation.</p> <p>The guy on my left asked me, "Are you ready?" I looked at Adam, who was still grinning, and told him I was. He smiled and nodded. I turned my eyes back to Adam as I took his hand and kissed him, "I can't believe how wild this is."</p> <p>I watched the first guy take Adam's hand and he followed closely behind me as I led him across the room to join the other guys in the living room. The first guy was already sitting down and making himself comfortable between us. We looked at the other guys as we looked from one to the other and then I turned to face back to Adam and kissed him fully on the mouth. After a moment of surprise, my tongue moved forward slowly and I licked the tip of Adam's as he returned the kiss. God, I was so horny. I moved my hand down his back and found his belt, quickly unbuckled the belt, and undid the zipper of a nice sliver button. I smiled to myself as I moved my hand across from his belt to his shorts, and felt the tent-like hardness he had in his boxers. He gave a small gasp as I grasped the elastic around the base of his cock, the first I had ever done.</p> <p>I pulled his boxers down a bit and he lifted each leg as they were pulled down, and I looked upâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
