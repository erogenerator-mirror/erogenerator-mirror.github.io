I wrapped my arms around her body, hugging her as tightly as I could while we kissed and hugged, our lips finding each other's cheeks and neck, our bodies pressing against each other. We looked into each other's eyes and I could see a hunger there, a need that I'd never seen. It was as if we were both ready for more and more.</p> <p>I pulled back at the last second, allowing her back side to slip over mine again. I felt her lower back, and then she arched with a gasp as I felt my cock penetrate her tightness, my fingers spreading out to encircle her waist. I kissed her gently as I began to slowly fuck her in this position, my cock sliding effortlessly between her cunt lips again. The pleasure was growing almost immediately, and I leaned one arm around her, pulling on her shoulder. This gave me support for both our bodies and was something that I intended, if I ever did make love to a woman for the first time. I slowly let her back to where she was, allowing her to settle down onto my cock. Her breathing stopped short and she gasped once again. She put her head on mine and I could smell her perfume on her skin, and suddenly her body began to shake, and the bed creaked loudly as our bodies shook with a powerful orgasm that left us sweating and trembling.</p> <p>"It's ok now?" I asked her, concerned. "What was that I heard?" I asked her as she recovered from her orgasm and began to try to catch her breath. Her eyes were still closed and she nodded her head. "Shhhhh," she whispered. I could feel how tight she was and the tension of her body. It felt like my cock had a life of its own, the skin beneath was as taught as all hell and would give her an incredible experience. My hands reached around to the other side of her waist and I wrapped my hand around her as well, pulling her down even more so that we would be pressed together. We moaned a little as I felt her body shift and she reached up to give me a long, deep kiss. "That was amazing," she said breathily.</p> <p>"You're so beautiful," I said softly, and started to slowly push my cock into her, feeling my way back into her cunt until she felt me touching her hymen. I could feel her body tighten around me and I stopped to let her get used to me. "Are you going to be ok?" I asked her anxiously.</p> <p>"Just stay still," she said in a soft voice, but it was clear that she was already feeling the same way that I was. My hands caressed her as she lay almost flat on me, and I pushed slowly into her as she wrapped her arms around my neck and I kissed her.</p> <p>She put her hand on the side of my face and kissed me again. "That's it," she said, "this is good."</p> <p>Slowly I began to withdraw and push back into her. Each time I pushed into her, we felt as if we were making a sound as I did so. As my cock moved back and forth within her, she reached up with one hand to rub her breast. I knew from her movements that her hands were rubbing her nipple between thumb and forefinger at the same moment that I pushed back into her. She was making soft little grunts around my cock, but I made no sound and just moaned as I began to move in and out of her. Her body moved as her hands moved over her nipples, and she began to moan more intensely. Her moaning had a different urgency and volume to it, as if her body was trying to squeeze us tighter together in front of a very powerful orgasm. I couldn't help but notice that she was biting her lower lip now and that she was moving her hips against me rather than thrusting her pussy up against me.</p> <p>"Oh baby...oh baby...oh baby...yesssss..." she whispered softly, and then began breathing more heavily. I kept pumping her faster, and I could feel her moving her hips on mine to meet my thrusts. We fucked so hard, that I could hear the sounds of our skin slapping against each other as we thrust into each other. I felt her hands on my ass, and I could feel some sort of jolt as she pulled me up, moving me deeper into her. I felt the tension of her body starting to slip back, and the pain was not that much different. It was an intense feeling. I looked up to see her eyes rolling slightly as they did when the pain became too intense to bear anymore.</p> <p>"Take me baby, take me nowâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
