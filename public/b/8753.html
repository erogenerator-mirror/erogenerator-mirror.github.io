He felt warm, like he had a warm, wet blanket covering him with his warm, soft breath. The thought made him feel so warm...he'd never felt that warm. And that was the way he wanted to feel. It was like a moment out of the past. He had to get out for a second, like a movie scene in a modern movie.</p> <p>The idea of not only returning to the room now, but now living forever again made him shiver as he imagined the future he would have with this gorgeous woman, if he could let her go.</p> <p>He felt like an invisible hand began to slide off his shoulders and down his back; he was sure of it. His nipples were already beginning to stiffen and he felt his chest begin to ache a little bit more as he pictured this woman in his mind. She was almost like a goddess now, his very wife... he wanted to kiss her beautiful face...his wife looked so lovely...maybe he'd get to see those long legs and her breasts that he'd see when he was her age, the little boy who'd run his hands through the soft-looking bush of hair. Then a beautiful woman with curves in all the right places and the best looking pussy he'd ever eaten...</p> <p>She closed his door, and then quickly ran to her house.</p> <p>He could imagine her there, the way those gorgeous legs looked, he could not stop smiling...and he could not stop thinking about how she tasted...in that moment the thought of seeing her in the state that he was in made him feel like he could feel warm water and his cock in her mouth...fucking her...feeling her tongue, touching...explanions of the most wonderful body in the world...</p> <p>He felt the hand on his back push him against the door as his own hand slid down to run along his leg...he could feel his cock growing, harder and harder and his fingers slid further and further along his thighs. He moaned a little as if trying to stave off an imminent orgasm.</p> <p>"What?" she said as he tried to stand up. "You're shivering, honey. What's wrong?"</p> <p>"It's just that, ah... it's just, ah... well, it does feel so good for me..." he said as his hand moved towards him and then back again.</p> <p>"Well, honey, what's the matter?" she said with a pout.</p> <p>"I don't think I..." and, suddenly, he felt her hot breath on his neck "I don't think my..."</p> <p>"Honey, I just love being with you. I love pleasing you." she smiled.</p> <p>He tried to continue to stand as his head began to bob and roll under her, but with every movement he forced himself to stand still and enjoy these incredible feelings. Her head was still touching his...and not for him at all...it was all about the feeling of his naked chest against hers- just as it was about the feeling of her soft mouth against his, the thought of her naked body in his arms...</p> <p>His own hands began to slide over her body, sliding across her stomach and into the dark curls of her hair where he could see her eyes; their color deepening and the way they were closing and opening slightly more, and looking...it was the color that brought the most pleasure to him...the way the light from the streetlights came in, the way the lights in the dark and the city lights seemed to come in on and on..."</p> <p>"Oh, God, I never imagined anything like this. How did you ever get into our bedroom?"</p> <p>"I don't know, he told me a little back. I was just as I was before you entered our house but not quite in the same light. But, uh, he did enjoy it and wanted to be as close as possible."</p> <p>"Well, we can get that experience. It does make for great memories."</p> <p>"Hm, so now that we're here, I thought you wanted something?" she said after a moment.</p> <p>"Of course, love. Why don't I get him a glass of water?" he said, and poured him a glass, and she grabbed a couple of glasses out of her purse. He took a couple of more and began to sit down again, still not wanting to make his wife feel uncomfortable.</p> <p>"Honey, I can't believe we're being this way, so... you know, when we're..."</p> <p>"Just being intimate then?" she said coyly, still with a smile on her face.</p> <p>"Well, ah...I've never... you know... done that to you beforeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
