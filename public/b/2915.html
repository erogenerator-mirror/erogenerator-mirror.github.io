With the way I had been feeling at the moment, I had to admit that it had been the best of both worlds. I wanted to thank that wonderful, wonderful creature in me that I had created and given my body to.</p> <p>I thought back on something I had done with our parents, how our mom had come home from work to find us in bed together. We had been going out at different times and it had been obvious that they had been going to bed together, and that made it seem like we had already been together. It was one of the reasons that I still hadn't really come out of the house that weekend. It had seemed like we had been going to the trouble of getting away.</p> <p>We had been able to figure out that mom had been trying to get into our bed for some time now, since it all felt like a long, lonely time. It had been difficult because they both really wanted to find the other and it was very clear that our sex life was suffering, although we had never told them. At this point in our lives, we could have cared less. We were just enjoying each other's company.</p> <p>If you had asked me two weeks ago, I probably would have started to say that I shouldn't have done what I had done. All I know is that I couldn't have done anything except what we had done. That was the one thing I couldn't stand. If I had stopped what I had done, well it would have just been the sex, but if I hadn't stopped, well the two of us would have ended up at the ends of someone else's bed, just like we had done with our parents.</p> <p>It was very complicated, but I just wanted to do it and then do something good at the same time.</p> <p>The problem we were at the moment was that I suddenly felt like a big, stupid boy, and just wanted to put the fun and excitement into it.</p> <p>I had seen so many attractive women in my short life. At the age of thirty-eight, I had already got into more than most of them. And at the age of fifty-two, my body had matured much more.</p> <p>Being a lawyer with several successful companies, I was still fairly attractive. However, I found that, until some time ago, I had never really had a great sexual partner. And, frankly, sex with a man wasn't that good either.</p> <p>I wasn't sure what to do. I guess that is partly why I hadn't dated very closely and had been so successful at the outset. It wouldn't be easy but, once I was old enough to remember what men are like, I figured if I wanted to do it with a man, then, I was going to have to try it. As long as I didn't try to get into a relationship that would likely lead to an affair, anything else was better.</p> <p>But, then, as much as sex with a grown-up woman is better and more pleasurable than with someone old enough to be my mother. I didn't have to have sex with anyone. It was as simple as that; you had sex with a nice man you liked, and that's all I needed. I could just pretend and go about my normal routine without feeling guilty for having spent so much time with my parents, and that would be nice.</p> <p>As much as life was trying to hide what I wasn't really looking at, I liked the feeling of being with someone who wasn't exactly young. That is just what I had felt. As much as I wanted to see myself in some of those other older women I might even meet, but I decided to look for myself first, so to speak.</p> <p>One night I was drinking a very good vodka, and I was really getting into it with my eyes. I had a quick shower, got dressed, went down on the bed, and fell asleep quite quickly, with the feeling that maybe, just maybe, a big, special night would come up that evening. I was sure there would be a future for us, if we could just do it through one night. But, that was one more time.</p> <p>So, the next afternoon I was sitting on a deck chair with a drink in each of my hands and looking over at the tree in front of the house, with the waves coming in from the other side. Nothing really went on, except for some sun and the occasional flash of some great looking woman. Well, maybe not all of it, but something that was worth waiting for.</p> <p>I guess some people think a lot of their dreams come true; some can make all the difference in the world. Even if it is really not for everyone's own reasons, I know it can be made. There was a reason why I couldn't afford to let one of the reasons I couldn't afford to give up my jobâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
