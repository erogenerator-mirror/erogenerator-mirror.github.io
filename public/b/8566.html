"Gosh, this is nice."</p> <p>She was only smiling, so I wasn't too sure that what she was about to say had any truth to it.</p> <p>"It's the first time I thought I was doing the right thing," she stated, her voice full of innocence as she gazed at us with a wide smile.</p> <p>"So you wanna make it a little more serious? I'd love to show you something." I knew she'd already heard of my collection. "Or maybe this will help?"</p> <p>Sitting up I placed us both on the couch, still naked and just as gorgeous as the first time I'd ever seen her. My heart was still pounding in my chest as I took her, the first time either of us came so close to each other.</p> <p>"So, would you like to...do that?" I asked.</p> <p>Nodding, she sat up and wrapped her arms around me, not stopping their loving embrace. "I'd love to...anything to do..." she murmured, her eyes shining brightly again as the kiss finally broke.</p> <p>"I'm glad you like it. I did," I said, kissing her cheek and looking back into her sparkling blue eyes. "I really do have to admit that I'm surprised about this. We've never been together like this before, but it just feels like the right thing to do now."</p> <p>She squeezed me as she looked at me, smiling as she felt my hard on pressed against her wet pussy. She slowly lifted her legs and wrapped them around mine, pulling me closer, our wet, sticky bodies nestled together. I gently ran my hand down her face, cupping her jaw, and down her neck, her breasts, her flat stomach, her thighs, and finally her pussy.</p> <p>My hand slipped between our bodies, caressing her skin as she leaned back onto me. She slid her legs up and around me, pressing herself against my hand as she felt my finger slide between her labia. As I slid my finger between her lips, she moaned loudly and pulled me to her, her hands coming to my shoulders so she could lock her lips around mine.</p> <p>"Oh god...right there," she moaned into my lips, running her hands lovingly over my shoulders and back. "Fuck...oh god, that's so good..."</p> <p>And she did, in no time at all, the best sex either of the two girls had ever had, and both being a bit aroused by this new found affection. We sat there, her kissing me, running her hands over my wet body as I slid my finger along her pussy, her thighs tensing against my hand as the orgasm surged through her like a train.</p> <p>Pulling away, we gazed into each others' eyes. We'd only had this very brief, and probably very passionate, encounter, but it was already far from over and I was feeling the same kind of desire as my new friend, that she had for me.</p> <p>"Let's save that for when we get home..." I murmured, kissing her again. "I'm thinking of getting up to get us dinner and some wine for dessert," I suggested, taking her hand and gently leading her to the bedroom.</p> <p>"Good idea," she moaned as she followed me as I walked beside her, our eyes looking into each other's as I walked her down the hall to our bedroom.</p> <p>We went to take a shower, washing each other all over, our fingers interlocking together as we worked our way down, cleaning and washing our bodies, her fingers lightly running through my pubic hair and down my thigh. I kept kissing her mouth as we worked toward the bedroom, our hands making their way around each other so we could feel each other with our bodies again, running along one another's fingers.</p> <p>She took her shower while I slipped on my robe, slipping into the bed, facing her. I could feel her watching me, her hands running through her hair.</p> <p>"It was so beautiful the first time, so nice to be doing this again," I said, her gaze lingering on mine. "Do you wanna watch me with other girls?"</p> <p>"Mmm...maybe," she moaned, rolling onto her back, putting her arms behind her as she kissed my stomach. "Do you like girls now?"</p> <p>"Sure. How about me?" I asked, pulling the bottom of her robe so it fell off her shoulders, her big breasts dangling before me. "Maybe they're the only thing that makes me feel this good."</p> <p>"Then, let's have some wine. I'm feeling kind of mellow down here," she sighed, her eyes looking up at me, her gaze moving down to my hard cock.
