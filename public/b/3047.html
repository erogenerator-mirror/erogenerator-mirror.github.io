So..." she said, looking down her nose, staring at him and suddenly very aware of her bare breasts and the way he was looking at her. "Okay," she said, "I'm going to run upstairs now and take a shower."</p> <p>"I'm going to go get my toothbrush," he said.</p> <p>"No. I have to get to bed right now. I'll get some clothes on. Then I'll get some food on me too."</p> <p>He laughed as he left. "You don't have to do that," he told her. "I'm sorry." He shook his head. "I guess I was just thinking that it may be a little weird to talk to you about this."</p> <p>Greta stood up slowly. As she came up to him, she looked in his eyes and saw a serious look in his. "Gloria, we have to talk," he said.</p> <p>"Okay," she said. "Then what are you going to do?"</p> <p>"I don't know," he replied without a sound. "I just think that if we just talk, we might not have too much to cause us problems."</p> <p>"Is that what you're talking about," she asked while putting her hand on his arm. "What if I was a bad boy and you didn't think it was okay, or something. What if we did something so bad that we had to pull through in order to get home?"</p> <p>"It wouldn't bother you much?" he asked. "That'd be okay," he said as his hand slid down to touch her bare thigh, just below her knee. His hand began moving up and down, but he didn't move his hand right away. "No?" she asked. "That would bother you?" her hand moved up to rest on his crotch. She could feel the heat that she was generating from his dick as it pressed against the fabric of her jeans. "That would be okay?"</p> <p>"Sure," came the reply. "But you were right when you said that, I've been thinking that," he said, "that you'd feel so good naked, like all I had was a few things."</p> <p>"Yeah, I was thinking that," Greta agreed.</p> <p>He turned to return to the bedroom and she looked down at her own bare breasts with a smile on her face. "Gloria, I'm sorry. I just thought that that might be nice." Then he sat down on the bed as if to pull the covers aside and she turned and walked to him.</p> <p>"Gloria," he said as she came closer. He put his hands on her shoulders and helped her walk around him in front of him. She noticed that his face was red and puffy and that he was breathing a little fast. She smiled at him and took his hand and brought it to her lips. Their lips came together, and they quickly lost themselves in the kissing they were both doing.</p> <p>"Oh my God," they both heard Greta say. "I...I feel so...so...I think I love you," she said as they broke apart.</p> <p>"Oh gosh," he said. "Are you sure?"</p> <p>"Are you sure you're okay with this?" she asked.</p> <p>"I am sure," he said with a shrug. "But you got to tell me this thing," he said as he pulled her in his arms and gave her a big hug. "I love you too," he said as he held her in his arms.</p> <p>They stayed in that position for a long time, then he pulled her back toward him and bent to gently kiss her breasts as she kissed him again. His hands began feeling her bottom and then up to her breasts as they continued kissing. His hands began kneading and pressing them very slightly as they kissed and the kisses grew in passion.</p> <p>"Oh yes," she thought with a smile. He began to pull her shirt up as she tried to lift it off, which she did as he was going to undress her.</p> <p>"Oh my God," she said when he finished unbuttoning her shirt. "It's time to get out of these clothes," she thought as she undid one button after another before finally pushing it away from her body. "My panties too," she thought after she undid the rest of her buttons.</p> <p>"Oh my God," she thought again. She reached behind her and undid the snap to her bra. Now only her panties barely covered her boobs. She smiled at him again as she pushed the bra off her body and tossed it aside.</p> <p>They kissed again, and he began to touch her bare breasts with one hand as he felt her soft skin with the other.
