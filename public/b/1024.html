He pulled out a pair of handcuffs and laid them both on the bed.</p> <p>"What are you doing?" she asked, confused. "You want me to leave?"</p> <p>"I got to do a few things first," he pointed to the vibrators and the butt plug, "to help me make sure you never get away with doing any of these things if things go wrong," he explained. He held two bottles of lube up and told her to put them both on without asking permission. She stood, got in the other bed and knelt by the side of the bed. He lifted her chin so that her face was up close to his.</p> <p>"Is it okay if we use the toys for a little while?" he asked quietly. She nodded and he slipped the first strap on up to her crotch, pulling her lips apart and securing it. The other strap left her wrists and he reached over to her and slipped his hard cock between her lips. She didn't move as she sucked on it. He let her get used to the cock in her mouth, her pussy was wet and ready. He slid it in and out as he licked her, his dick going deeper with each stroke.</p> <p>She got into the rhythm, a cock in her mouth while his fingers played with her clitoris, and her pussy was soon covered in juices and her breath became ragged as she worked on that cock. She felt it growing harder and knew it was going to be a long night. He pulled out and she heard him zip his jeans, zip them up again and turn off the light as he walked around and went back to his bed.</p> <p>She felt his lips kiss her on the head and then her mouth was closed around it, his tongue caressing it, the taste of her cum in her mouth. She felt like he was going to suck it all into his mouth, and all the way down her throat. He slid on the bed and started kissing her again, this time her lips and tongue were entwined around him.</p> <p>He grabbed the lube off the bed and smeared it over his hard dick and lubed it up again. He knelt down and slid the head of his cock between her lips so that they were just touching. She could feel the wetness on his head and the heat spreading around him as he slid deeper and deeper in her mouth, it felt so good, her mouth slid down around him as he slid further into her.</p> <p>"Fuck, you are so tight and so fucking fuckable! Fuck me, fuck me right now. I want you to take me!" he demanded. He reached down and grabbed her hips with one hand and pulled her closer to him.</p> <p>She wrapped her legs around him as he pushed his cock harder into her and she felt the head of his dick start to get bigger and bigger as it went deeper and deeper until he was completely buried in her mouth. He was so hard, and his dick felt so sexy as she held him in her mouth and kept it there, feeling him pulsate in his pants, knowing that he was going to cum in her mouth.</p> <p>He kept driving them into a new position until she felt him tense up and she felt his cum shooting into her mouth and on her tongue as it slid down her throat. She swallowed as often as she could but some of it leaked out the sides of her mouth. This time she could see it on her face and slide into her mouth as she held her hand still to aim it at the next hole.</p> <p>He pulled part way out of her mouth and slid it back in until she had a nice and smooth rhythm going. She could feel the head of his dick press against hers and knew he could feel her warm, wet cunt being held around his shaft and the feel of her juices around him. He looked down at the site of how hard he had got her and she could see the drops of his cum on her stomach, running down her cunt lips and ass.</p> <p>He pulled back and he leaned over to kiss her, letting his tongue slide through her mouth so that she could lick his cum and that he was too surprised to stop. She did the best she could to hold him off as she felt her cunt start to tighten and the cum started to ooze out of her.</p> <p>His hand cupped her right tit as he slid the tip of his tongue on her nipple, which made her arch her back. She had lost control of any conscious thought. Her entire world seemed to spin as she felt the cum flowing down around her pussy. It felt amazing and it was only a matter of time. She felt him slide his cock out of her cunt, her legs fell by her side.</p> <p>He lay down on the bed next toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
