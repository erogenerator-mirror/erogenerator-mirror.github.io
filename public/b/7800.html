I said between my quickened breaths.</p> <p>"Don't be." He pouted. "There's cum on your chin." He said again and I felt him squeeze hard on my balls before releasing them. I didn't understand but then again I never really understood women's bodily fluids.</p> <p>Once he finished using me, he stepped back. "God, that was unbelievable." He panted and looked at me. "Did you ever think it would happen like that?"</p> <p>I reached up and grabbed his hand and gave it a squeeze. "What were you thinking?"</p> <p>"I didn't mind. But, I'm not done with you." He said it so calmly and with such tenderness I was not surprised.</p> <p>"You are?" I said with a small laugh, my mind racing.</p> <p>"Yes, I am. But let's save that for later." He said as he sat down on my bed. "We have a lot to do if we're going to win tonight."</p> <p>We did. It was a quick team break and we had only time during the first half before he was tired. With one look back at me, I didn't give a shit. "So, you think this was your first blow job?" I asked.</p> <p>"Oh, yea." He answered me.</p> <p>"And?" I knew this meant he didn't want to blow me again.</p> <p>"You can really deep throat a guy, baby. You can really deepthroat any guy you want."</p> <p>His voice was light and kind of sexy. "And what exactly could a girl do for an er..."</p> <p>"I like big guys." I was surprised I didn't get jealous or anything. He gave me the look of a good actor.</p> <p>"You like big guys huh?" He asked as he gave me the smile I loved. I had wanted to get into bed with him before and have sex with him, but I was too horny and horny for that.</p> <p>"It's just, you know, that you're just so, right?" I did all that and he gave me a short laugh. "Yeah, I guess I love it." His response was to lean over and kiss me. I returned the kiss and we fell back onto my bed. He laid me on my side while he kissed my neck. "You're right, I love it. I love what you do to me and for you."</p> <p>I could tell he meant it because he made no sounds as he worked his way down to my breast, and he took both into his mouth. He cupped them both with his hand and sucked my nipple between his lips. I let out a little moan and he let go of them, grabbing the nearest breast and giving it a playful tug.</p> <p>"Is it sensitive, baby?" He asked. "Don't worry I just teased and played a little bit for you." He took my nipple in his teeth lightly and rolled it around while his other hand slid up and down my stomach, all the way to my pussy. I let out a few moans and he let go of it slowly just as he let go of it.</p> <p>His hand left my breast and went down to my pussy lips which was slick with arousal already. He slipped two fingers into my pussy and it felt like paradise; it was warm, wet, and slick and he worked them in and out for a few minutes as he fingered me, his thumb brushing against my clit. I didn't know how I was going to be able to take it anymore but I couldn't wait any longer, I needed to feel him inside of me and I knew it. I rolled us over like he was on top of me and he slid all the way inside me. I felt how tight I was and he felt like he had no real length. It probably didn't make it any easier, but for us I was sure it would be okay. I reached around and played with his balls while I took his thick member out of my mouth and he held it as it was so sensitive he had to hold it. I felt myself stretching out in all directions around him and he gave a low groan as I felt my pussy contract around him and he let go of me.</p> <p>He smiled up at me and I moved back and forth just a bit and I felt him rubbing against my g-spot like it was my pussy. My back arched as I felt myself building up and I didn't know how much more I could take. He kissed me as he continued to stroke me while I took over, rocking back and forth and my hips bucked, fucking his cock deeper and deeper with each stroke. I felt myself about to cum again but was not about to let it happen.</p> <p>"Yes, fuck me, fuck me!" I moaned as he moved a little faster andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
