"God, yes."</p> <p>"Well, I want to be inside of you. I want to feel all of you, as your pussy squeezes my dick. Then I want to lick it and kiss your beautiful body until it is completely out of control. So I got dressed and left, not knowing whether to let you out or fuck you." He smiled as his girlfriend smiled back at him and winked. Her body tingled with heat all over with his words; the last thing she needed was a cock. He grabbed her hand as she began to move towards the bedroom.</p> <p>"Wait." She looked confused. "Do you really want me to take you there?"</p> <p>He smiled, "You know I do. I told you I'm ready to do anything you want of me."</p> <p>"I guess so." She kissed him deeply and then looked back at him. "What else do you want to do?"</p> <p>"You can start with fucking me."</p> <p>"I'm not sure how to..." She stopped in mid sentence. "How are you sure this isn't just a fantasy coming to an end."</p> <p>"I want it to come to an end. Now please lay on the bed."</p> <p>She quickly lay on the bed, spread her legs and waited for him to enter her. As he knelt above her, he reached down and took hold of her ankles, pushing the bottom of her legs up further until she was stretched obscenely before him. Then he pushed the head of his dick inside of her. He watched his dick disappear into her body from above and it was then that he finally looked at her. "Ready?"</p> <p>"God yes. Fill me up with everything you know about fucking. Do whatever you want with me"</p> <p>He pulled his dick out of her before slowly sliding it back inside her. She began to rock her hips up and down as he moved his hips until she pressed against his and they began to move in the same rhythm. They moved in a syncopated rhythm. The sensation of his dick entering her body was so wonderful. He took her hand and placed it over and under her stomach when his hips pushed in deep. It made her so wet. She smiled, feeling his prick inside of her and then began to press against his crotch as he slowly began to move his hips more. The effect was just one long stroke.</p> <p>It was like the heat of summer. She squeezed him as it became so hot inside of her. He pushed her hand down onto her stomach and began moving her hips faster and faster. The friction created was perfect. The feeling of each stroke on her clit was just too good. Just the thought brought her closer to an orgasm. She closed her eyes and threw her head back and her hands were still on her stomach.</p> <p>"You feel so good!" he said as he continued to use one hand to fuck her and the other rubbed her clit harder.</p> <p>"Oh, God!" she yelled and then she came. He heard her and held his dick inside of her as all of the tension built in her body, as the first wave of pleasure rushed and washed over her. His hands tightened on her body as he continued his assault on her. She came a second time and they were both breathing heavy. The feeling of his hands on her body was electric. He felt her tremble with each of orgasmic movements, as the orgasm passed through her body. He was still inside of her when it subsided and she finally began to open her eyes again. He moved his hips a little, so that most of his cock remained inside of her. He leaned down and kissed her as she looked at him and saw the look of satisfaction on his face. "That was very special. You are so beautiful," he said as he pulled his dick out.</p> <p>"Thank you."</p> <p>They lay together for what seemed like forever. Finally they got off the bed and she stood up and said she was going to shower off. He followed, then she walked over to the bathroom and opened the door one last time. She turned and went back to the side and closed it behind her. "Now we can go do what we came here to do," she said as she walked out the door, heading back to her bedroomâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
