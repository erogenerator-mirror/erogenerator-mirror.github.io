Her nipples and her clit were on fire, and a sudden sensation that she had not felt before. Cheryl took care of things by sucking Susan's clit, while she licked, flicked and nibbled on her other breast.</p> <p>Susan's breathing deepened and intensified as a long-awaited orgasm washed over her. Cheryl's mouth stayed on Susan's clit and she felt herself tighten, growing larger and tighter in response to Susan's orgasm.</p> <p>"Ahhhhhhhhhhh..."</p> <p>Cheryl felt Susan clamping down on her fingers, her hips arching of their own accord, as Cheryl's mouth sent Susan into a shuddering orgasm that had her mouth open widely and a cry piercing her throat.</p> <p>Susan had an incredibly vivid and beautiful moment. Cheryl knew that she had lost control. This couldn't be happening. That the man of her dreams could do this to her. She had been so used and so violated by her body, she had been turned on by it for so long it was scary. Not only that, but now the feeling of submission and submission, it was the turn-on she had been denying her self for so long.</p> <p>Susan's body went limp and she moaned softly, holding Cheryl's head against her for a minute or two as her breathing came slowly and gently. Cheryl's mouth began to move up and down on Susan's clit, and the two sisters continued kissing and sharing the delicious flavors of their bodies all over.</p> <p>In the darkness, as Cheryl softly massaged Susan's breasts, with one hand, squeezing gently while the other gently squeezed Susan's nipples as they kissed, Cheryl felt her other nipple hardening between her thumb and index finger. The sensation was amazing.</p> <p>Susan moaned again as Cheryl's hand slid from breast to breast, her nipples pushing out on her palm as she slowly lifted her breast up. Cheryl's hand glided along it, her hand coming suddenly off Susan's hardened teat. Her breast was still turgid but as she lowered her nipple to Susan's lips, there was no stopping. Susan moaned loudly as Cheryl's tongue slid and probed in and out of her, exploring the nub of her nipple.</p> <p>Susan's hips began to move in time with hers, grinding her clit against her sister as Cheryl's tongue slid back and forth across it. A moan of delight escaped her lips as Cheryl's tongue swirled around her nipple. She felt as if her own pussy was on fire and she felt as if the sensations and ecstasy flowing from her nipples were taking her into another dimension, yet she still did not want more.</p> <p>With her free hand Cheryl took a hand and slowly worked Susan's inner legs, parting them as they moved. She eased them open so she could get access to her pussy, her fingers sliding from Susan's labia up to her clit, gently rubbing it as Susan raised her head. Cheryl kissed Susan's mouth and then her neck, her breasts, her nipples, her belly and up to her earlobe. Susan ran her tongue in and around her ear while breathing hard.</p> <p>Cheryl slid one hand further down to Susan's pussy, brushing the tip of her finger across it before sliding back up to Susan's clit. Cheryl's finger, slightly lower. Susan lifted her hips, trying to force it into Cheryl's fingers and then, as if in a sudden effort, Cheryl slipped it in and out of her own pussy.</p> <p>"Ohhhhhhhhh... yes... yes..."</p> <p>Susan was on fire. She felt her juices seep from her pussy and she felt her pussy begin to throb uncontrollably as Cheryl expertly worked her. Her eyes closed again. Her hips were writhing on their own and her body was on fire with lust. The feeling building inside her was unlike any she had previously felt. It was like a powerful current of a fire, sending her into orbit.</p> <p>Cheryl lowered her hand a little more and felt it slide back up Susan's quim, her fingertips finding the damp wet slit and sliding along her slit from below. She felt Susan's pussy open for her, opening to take her fingertips deeper. She felt Cheryl's fingers sliding inside, in deeper, almost to touch against the outside of her pussy.</p> <p>Susan moaned her appreciation of the sensations of Cheryl's fingers in her wetness. A sound from Cheryl that seemed to send shock waves through her heart and down her extremities until they merged into one.</p> <p>"Mmmm.... yess.... mmmm..."</p> <p>Cheryl began a slow, but steady, massage as she slipped her fingers deep into Susan's pussy. It was so tight, even if the walls had never closed like she had. Cheryl's fingers slid deeply into her, penetrating her very coreâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
