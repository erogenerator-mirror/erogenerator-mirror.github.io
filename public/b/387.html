I have two questions. Do you know the first one?"</p> <p>"Of course, but I have to ask the second one. Is she pregnant?"</p> <p>"Of course she's pregnant with a child. I have no intention of doing anything to hurt her. How many people think she is pregnant?" I looked at him, almost in shock. I expected him to smile, because this was not a good thought when dealing with his mother, I decided. I reached out my hand to him.</p> <p>"H-how do you know? I asked incredulously.</p> <p>"Let me just say something then," he said laughing. "My Dad is the same man, but not that good he is."</p> <p>"I'm your father, I'm still your father." He laughed even harder. I looked at her with tears in my eyes. I didn't know I could be anything more than son in person, but to hear him say it was the best thing that could be said. I didn't know what to say to that. I knew he was the man I married, but my feelings for him, I had never felt.</p> <p>After looking at her for a long time, I said, "I love you, but she is not my child."</p> <p>"That's not entirely true," she said. "I still love you. I've been waiting for you to tell me what you're doing now, and then I can see you getting ready to leave to get a job after you hear from my father."</p> <p>I was still confused about that. I didn't think she was pregnant, but I knew my parents had been doing a lot of planning to get their own daughter, that there wasn't really so much to it. What the hell was I to do?</p> <p>"I'm glad you're here," she said. "I would've probably just asked you to stay the night, not that I would've had much time. Besides, I don't think you understand about your own pregnancy."</p> <p>Her words broke my heart. I knew that even if I didn't do something, I would still be with her. Even if I did hurt her I could just say that I loved her, just as we both made love this night. And if she wasn't with someone that she loved, I guess I was ok with it. I looked at her, and knew then that I still loved her.</p> <p>"Thanks," I said, holding her. "You look happy too."</p> <p>"I am happy that you like having the baby," she said in her usual sweet voice. "Not many of my friends are happy with the baby, except my mother and I. I've always thought that the baby needed to go for your father, but you seemed like a normal guy," she smiled.</p> <p>"I told you, my parents were planning to make a baby."</p> <p>"I know they did," she said smiling again. "Dad is a nice guy. He was my first real boyfriend and my best friend." She gave me a winker and said, "I'm guessing no one else has a baby like you have." I smiled back at her and said, "I think I will just stay home tonight."</p> <p>"Nonsense! You're already home," she said. With that she threw her arms around me, pressing her large body against mine and said, "I don't want any of that. Let me get some tissues out and help you clean up."</p> <p>When she had finished getting the tissues out I handed them to her. She quickly turned her back to me, grabbed one, and started wiping her face. She smiled again when she looked back at me and said, "I'll keep that for your father and I will call you later this week."</p> <p>And with that she turned, put a kiss on my forehead and got a tissue from her night stand. She turned toward the door with one hand and wiped the rest of her face dry with the tissue she had taken out to clean up before walking back to her bedroom. The time passed by quickly as I sat at the table in stunned silence. As it passed I could see that she was crying now with tears streaming from her eyes. I reached over and put my hand in her lap where we kissed one last time and she smiled at me. I leaned over and kissed her before sitting down in my chair and trying to think of a way to put this all back. It did come up out of nowhere, but it seemed to be the only thing that had stuck in my mind.</p> <p>She came out of the bedroom and kissed me on the cheek very sweetly as she said, "Thank you." She didn't really look happy to see me at this point, and I was confused as to why. It was like having a hard on.</p> <p>To be continued</p> <p>If you liked or want details please email me. <|endofâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
