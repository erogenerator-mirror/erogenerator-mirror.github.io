I didn't do that too."</p> <p>"No, I mean it. I really don't mean that."</p> <p>"No, but you're still beautiful, so don't get any ideas or go get embarrassed, you're not just a woman. You're the most beautiful woman in the world now. Are you getting jealous, are you getting mad?"</p> <p>"No, of course not!" she said emphatically, and she got up and left, walking down the hallway toward the basement.</p> <p>"And we're really going to do it, just you and I. After that..."</p> <p>She left, and I sat there to think on what I had just done.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>My heart sank a little as I made my way downstairs to find my mom just leaving the house with her two friends.</p> <p>"Mom! Are you okay?" I asked as I followed her down the stairs.</p> <p>"I think so," she replied. "How do you mean?"</p> <p>"Well, I guess. I'm kinda busy, so it's kinda hard, but I have a couple of plans and would love to come visit you. I'd like to see that you're a happy woman. It would be nice, really appreciate it. You're the sexiest girl I know, but it's never something you do, so don't rush yourself."</p> <p>"Thank you. I really like you, Kevin."</p> <p>"What about you, Amy?" I said, still stalling.</p> <p>"I think so. If you can find ways to get me to come around to visit you in a more permanent way, we'll discuss it, okay?"</p> <p>I shook my head and she led me into the kitchen. She put a couple of cups and saucers in front of her, and asked me to get some coffee.</p> <p>"A cup of coffee? What's in there?" I asked, and she nodded back at me. I sat down at the table and got my tray of cups. After taking cups from the tray, mom sat down at the table as well.</p> <p>"Can I get you anything? Coffee?" she asked.</p> <p>"I'm okay," I replied, "and no, I didn't make you one, I don't have any coffee. I'll just bring some wine, if you like."</p> <p>"Oh, I prefer fresh coffee, that's fine. Thank you," she said, and she smiled at me as I walked off.</p> <p>"Mom, you just looked SO incredibly beautiful in those shorts and that T-shirt, and we were talking about how nice your breasts are," I remarked, putting down my cup and walking over to her.</p> <p>"Are you sure?" she asked in that soft voice that made her seem like a teenager. "I've always wondered how much a guy's penis looks when it's poking through?"</p> <p>"Mom."</p> <p>"Yes, honey," she said. "I'm very, very positive, as are you. Your breasts look SO nice."</p> <p>"Thanks," I said, again trying to be honest, but my eyes were still downcast.</p> <p>"Do you mind if I make the coffee?" she asked, but she was already looking around.</p> <p>"I think you can make it. It's pretty late, though. What do you know?" I said, and then went back to mixing up the coffee.</p> <p>"I'll get it for you," she said, and walked away to the kitchen, where she brought the coffee with a little spoon. I took it to the table as I set it down, and she walked over to me again. Now she was facing me, her face close to mine. I looked away and leaned forward, so we couldn't kiss, and she leaned forward and put her lips on mine ever so lightly.</p> <p>I felt her mouth open as I pressed her lips with mine, and I put my hands on her shoulders, feeling her soft shoulders for the first time. She looked surprised, as if she had forgotten I was even there. She leaned her head back and said softly, "Are you sure you don't mind?" and then I felt her kiss me once again.</p> <p>I'm sorry if that made me sound like a woman, but now, that's how I felt. Not, I'm sorry, I really am. Please don't let this happen again, I'm really, really, really not. The last thing I want is for this to become a little one-time thing, because I know how your dad and motherâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
