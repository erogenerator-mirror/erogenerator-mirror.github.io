I could tell she was thinking. "I'd do anything for you!"</p> <p>"I like that, too," I stated quietly. I knew I was on my own for the moment. "So you'd like to feel what it'd be like to be with someone special."</p> <p>"Oh that'd be really nice," she smiled, pulling herself up on her elbow and looking at me. "But I really, really hope this time, no one has to know."</p> <p>I looked down at her and her eyes were red and puffy.</p> <p>"Honey, I won't tell if you don't, I don't care any more. I want to do it."</p> <p>"You want to...do it?" she said, looking back up at me.</p> <p>I knew that the sight that her eyes gave me so much, that her smile and those puppy-dog eyes so much. The way she looked at me made me want her even more. It wouldn't be easy for me to see how she felt about this. But all in good time and I couldn't let her do it soon enough.</p> <p>"I'm sure we can think of something that'll be more enjoyable for you."</p> <p>With that she leaned in and kissed me. Our tongues met and we began to kiss, passionately now, as if the kiss had been long and drawn out. I could feel her soft lips, feel the gentle press of her body against, against mine.</p> <p>It was sweet, a lot less sweet than when we started out kissing, but I knew it was sweet and if it was nice I would be happy.</p> <p>We kissed for a long moment then she pulled away and put both her hands over mine. She looked at me with those deep brown eyes and asked, "Are you sure you're not ready to do this?"</p> <p>"I am." I said.</p> <p>She looked at my hands and saw the ring on my finger and gave a small laugh.</p> <p>"But it's just a little trick," she continued. "But this is really important to me."</p> <p>I looked at her in wonder, a little shock and a big smile forming on my face.</p> <p>"I don't want to be the subject of your next conversation," I whispered, "I want to feel what we're making."</p> <p>"Don't you mean you want me too?" she said. "Don't you want me? I'll let you feel what it's like too."</p> <p>I nodded, not knowing if I had heard correctly, but knowing that I wanted to feel this so much. I turned to look at her, hoping that we were making this a permanent thing between us.</p> <p>"You're my best friend," she said. "I'm so happy that we're both married to other people - and I'm so glad you're mine - but if you don't feel as happy as you want....and if we end up doing something I'm so happy to do, just give me a chance."</p> <p>Her smile warmed me even more and I reached out and pulled her in by her waist. She had a light touch to it and I could feel how wet she was. I wrapped my arms around her and pulled her against me. My hands moved down and found her ass cheeks and we kissed again.</p> <p>We kissed for a long moment then she leaned back and turned me around so that I was facing her. She looked into my eyes as we kissed.</p> <p>"You're so handsome," she said. "If this is lovemaking now, then you are certainly right. I'm so happy that you're mine!"</p> <p>I kissed her again. We parted and she looked into her face again. She was a different person now, no more like she had been before. We smiled at each other and she said, "I really love you. Even if we never met in person, I know we'll see each other, and you'll feel the same about each other."</p> <p>"And you are happy to do this for me," I told her. "I've always really, really hoped you'd like it and will like it."</p> <p>"I'm happy to do this, and I love it," she said. "I'm happy I was able to find you, too. You're a great guy and if I ever find that we can meet and really get to know each other and love each other I'll be there for you."</p> <p>"So are you," I said with a smile.</p> <p>She grinned. She leaned back down and kissed me. We both knew we would end up doing this forever.</p> <p>But there she was, so beautiful and sexy, in this moment of perfectness, and I wanted her so much that if she was so happy to do this, then Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
