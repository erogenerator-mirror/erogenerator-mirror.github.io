I didn't realise you had so many people and places to visit and keep to. I thought it only got better," she looked away.</p> <p>She was feeling self conscious. Her heart started to beat faster. Her pussy felt warm and damp. She looked up at him. He reached out and laid his hand on her. There were no tears now. She felt a warm feeling of security. This was good. There was comfort in the fact that she was here. She wanted to touch him. He leaned forward and gave her one last kiss and walked her out of the hotel.</p> <p>She felt safe now. She trusted him.</p> <p>The evening was a buzz. People came in and sat around and watched her. She could feel comfortable with them and not have to worry about something. It didn't take much and she would be comfortable around them.</p> <p>When she found a place of her own, her friend, who seemed very nice came to see her.</p> <p>"I love the house and the pool. You are so kind."</p> <p>"You are so smart."</p> <p>"I'm not a dumb white boy, but I was born with it," she grinned.</p> <p>"We do it all the time," a guy's voice came from the group.</p> <p>"That's nice,"</p> <p>"We are always having some fun of our own," she laughed.</p> <p>"What you doing tonight?" the guy said.</p> <p>"Just watching the sights as well," she said looking in the rear-view mirror at them for a moment before looking back.</p> <p>"I wonder if we can hook up tonight," she said.</p> <p>"What do you mean, right now? That's all you have," another man said.</p> <p>"That would be the other party?"</p> <p>"Just watching."</p> <p>"So you can watch and be watched. Isn't that something you do a lot with your friends?" another man said.</p> <p>"No. I'm not a lot with people. I'm just trying to hold it together," she said with a shrug.</p> <p>"Oh don't worry, I'm happy to have you. I'm always up for a challenge."</p> <p>"You're never on the edge. You're always on top and no one can beat you. You're safe with me," she said as she gave him a kiss.</p> <p>"I always am always on top," he said.</p> <p>"I think that would work, as long as everyone who wants me is free," she smiled.</p> <p>"Not everyone you want to fuck is right now," he said, smiling again.</p> <p>"I'll just go change in the bathroom."</p> <p>She looked at her friends who were leaving.</p> <p>"What is your problem; what are you going to do about it?" she laughed back.</p> <p>"We can have sex together," someone said.</p> <p>"Well, I can't do that with someone I'm married to," the guy said.</p> <p>"This will be fun," she smiled at the guy and her friends.</p> <p>"I hope so. I'd like to be with anyone that would do this, too."</p> <p>"No, it wouldn't be right. You are my friend."</p> <p>"I know. I'd be happy to do whatever you wanted with my friends. I won't tell anyone," she smiled as she kissed him on the cheek.</p> <p>"Do you want to be friends?" he said looking at her.</p> <p>"I'm not sure, but I want to get to know each other better. I think my friends will be good friends and you should give each other a chance."</p> <p>She got the condoms in the mail and placed them in the pocket of her dress. They went to a nearby hotel room.</p> <p>She was in first. He felt her breath and a moment later, she was on the bed. He didn't need an orgasm to feel her.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Later, a couple of guys had started a conversation with her. They were both in their late twenties or early thirties and she liked them. It was easy to talk to them. They were not all that intimidating. He introduced himself as Jack.</p> <p>"Would you like to get to know me better?" she said when they talked.</p> <p>"What do you want to know?" he laughed.</p> <p>He had been waiting for her to say something.</p> <p>"Have you been cheating on me?" she grinned.</p> <p>"That's a long time ago. Maybe it's not the first time?" he said with a laugh.</p> <p>"Yes I've been cheating on you, now. That's different," she said wistfully.</p> <p>He thought, how long had it been since she had told anyone she was cheating on himâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
