It felt so good to have the feelings this way. I was still sucking her toes when I felt her hands around my waist pulling the waistline of my shirt downward. Her fingers brushed my hard nipples and I could feel them hardening with every caress.</p> <p>She pulled the front of my skirt over my hips exposing my pussy. She pushed my hips back and told me, "It looks like you are enjoying yourself as much as I am, too."</p> <p>I don't know if the answer came from her, the fact that I was wet and wanting something to touch, or my desire for her was just so overwhelming. My hips rose up so that her hand could slip under the fabric that encased my sex. Her fingers slipped into my slippery pussy spreading them and she found my hard clitoris.</p> <p>"I'm going to have to tell you a few more things about yourself in this house," she told me softly as her fingers played with my body. "Like what you like?"</p> <p>I was about to respond when she kissed me and then said, "That is a good thing, baby. I think we'll both enjoy this."</p> <p>She pulled my top over her head and I lay there, totally naked, my body shivering and tingling from the feeling that she'd caused. I thought that there would be a moment of shyness or embarrassment when she stripped completely naked with me. In actuality, she had stripped it all out.</p> <p>"How long do we say five years?" she asked.</p> <p>I hadn't really been thinking about the answer, but at the last moment, "That would be about a year, don't you think."</p> <p>"Let me give you a little time to get to know you," she replied.</p> <p>"I don't know. I think maybe that's the first time we've been together. I mean we never really talked about it with just having sexual thoughts about each other."</p> <p>"Let me be frank with you, baby," she said as she gently pushed my face down onto her breasts. "It has been a while, so we'll just have to do another first and maybe we can talk it off later."</p> <p>I looked up at her smiling face. I had been thinking about this for a long time. I had always pictured our first time together, though it had been over a year, before that. She was so sweet and patient, it had been so nice. Now, I remembered the feelings of her mouth and caress. What a beautiful woman I had made for her. I think I was a little less shy than the first night we did it.</p> <p>The feeling of her body against mine was like a wave breaking on my back as she lifted me up and sat down next to me on the couch next to her. We were still kissing, our bodies pressed back against each other's as we lay naked on the couch. "Do you feel this excitement in you?" she asked as her fingers moved down to my pussy.</p> <p>"Yes!" I answered as she stroked my hair, then down to fondle my breasts. She began licking me up and down the length of my vagina like she used to. There was the smell of fresh water, the saltiness of our sex, and a light sweatiness to it. I loved it when she did that. In a few minutes it felt like the most exciting thing I had ever felt.</p> <p>"Would you like to kiss me some more," she asked me, moving toward me.</p> <p>I didn't want to go any further, but I had been thinking about it all day. "I don't think it's a good idea," I said.</p> <p>"Oh, sure. If you don't want to, or that I'm too embarrassed to go much further," she continued, "I think that it would be really sexy, if you really, really really kissed me."</p> <p>That's one thing I hadn't thought about that. I'd always thought that kissing was about a simple physical thing. That kissing was meant as an expression of affection. That kind of sex was almost nothing. As a matter of fact, kissing was more like kissing than just being intimate. It was a kind of romantic expression, not the sort to feel comfortable or get scared of. Kissing a woman intimately would be so different, not that I objected to the way that we had kissed, more than that.</p> <p>"Let's find out if we want to," she said, then she sat up and pulled me to her, her lips pressing against mine and her body against mine. It felt just so wonderful. I could do anything the two of us wanted me to do. We never needed to stop or go too long. It was just so right. I think I was actually beginning to like the idea of kissingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
