I was ready, really. By the time I turned around, his arms were starting to hurt like crazy, and the swing had gone out on my back. What I didn't know is, I'd had the same reaction just a few seconds ago. But I was determined to enjoy the pain. After throwing one back, I kept one right there, feeling the power. I could feel his body tensing, the power going through his body. His arms were holding me down and he was moaning loudly, and not being able to do anything about it, at the same time. One of his arms was holding a fist to his cheek and one holding his throat, and his other arm was holding his body and pushing against another of its parts which were being pulled and pulled toward the limits of the swing. It took about 40 or fifty seconds for his body to be able to adjust to the position, and now the power was back with me. He was holding his breath, moaning again, no longer being able to do anything to me; the only sound that came out of his mouth was a guttural growl, and the power of the swing as more blood started to travel back down his body.</p> <p>The power started to get a little harder, and before I could do anything about it, a loud yell erupted from him, his body began to shake, and everything went down onto the swing, not caring about the pain.</p> <p>I let go of his waist, which meant that my hands couldn't stop him moving. That was when I felt his arms go around me, holding me up and putting me straight against the glass. I'm no virgin, but I got a little pissed off when I felt his cock, already wet with blood and rock hard and pulsating, press against my lower back and my ass. It had a little extra heat here too, and it had a little extra weight. He started to move, pressing his lower body against me, his cock pressing against my leg; it had more of an effect there than I realized. I looked down at him.</p> <p>"What's wrong?" I asked.</p> <p>"You're not done."</p> <p>The fact that he said that, and it made it all go, was a turn-on. He pressed his cock harder against me, and it felt really hard. I could feel it going into me, all the way, and all the way up to my breasts, to my neck, then moving back down to my chest. I wanted him to know how I felt about it. He was hard against me now too, because he was looking my body over, making sure that I was totally turned on from being dominated with this big muscular guy in front of me. His cock was pressing harder against me, rubbing up against my ass, where it was starting to swell. I was scared. I knew I was going to do whatever he wanted from now on, and that I was going to be used for his pleasure, whether or not it was in him, or what. I would be his.</p> <p>"Do you like this?" he asked me. "Yes." I answered him, as I turned my head to look back at him as I felt his cock go into me. I wanted him to fuck me, to fill me up, and I was not going to deny him anything.</p> <p>"Can you feel how big it is going into you?" He asked me, as his cock was pressed harder to my ass. He moved back to the swing, moving his cock around inside me as well.</p> <p>"Yes, it feels wonderful."</p> <p>"You've never felt anything like this before."</p> <p>"I mean, it felt fantastic, but it just didn't feel right." I answered him with.</p> <p>"It's not about you anymore, Baby." He said, as he felt what he was saying. "I'm not done."</p> <p>He knew he was right and I didn't move or react. He pulled his cock out of me. He was not going to make me take it again. His body was so hard. He was so powerful. He put one leg down and moved his hands up around my waist and behind my neck. He pulled me against him, so that his balls were now pressed against my pussy. He kissed me right on my chin and then in front of me, and just as he did, he moved his head and licked the side of my face.</p> <p>"That's all you'll get." He said. "I think you will love this."</p> <p>It wasn't a question, and after everything he'd said about my being submissive without being forced out, I was not a little scared of that happening.</p> <p>"I never want you to let me go from here." I said. "I'm going to let you have everything youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
