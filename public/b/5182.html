One afternoon when Brian and I were sitting by the pool, I told him I had had sex with both male and female partners but that I didn't think I could share a threesome with him. As he asked how I felt, I went a little on the wild side about another woman but I said in answer to his question, "Well, I have had two men in my life before, and I guess I would have loved to have had both together at the same time." His jaw dropped. He looked as if he wanted to do something like throw his arms around me and I guess he did.</p> <p>I have always taken it to heart when a man kisses me or cuddles with me on most occasions, but I felt very uncomfortable being his wife, so when he leaned over and kissed me, a little tongue play thing just never hurt, we both laughed, and he said he never was that comfortable with a female. He also never knew how excited I got having a female on top. He didn't have much of a relationship with women that I would guess. This was the first time I let this man and his wife know how excited I was, but the way he wanted to have sex with me was a big turn-on and I think I really enjoyed the sex we had.</p> <p>After we took a shower, we cuddled together on the bed and he told me that he had been seeing other women while we still had my high and mighty wife. At the time, I didn't really know how to answer he said he would do it if he could. It's funny, I had no idea that my husband didn't feel the same way about me. I know that he has always found a way to tell me what he wanted to accomplish sexually with a woman, but in real life he never had a chance, and no woman had ever turned him on as much as I did. Maybe I was wrong. I've always felt as if I had the right in my marriage for him to ask someone else for his wife.</p> <p>I know that I might just be taking it up the ass, or maybe it just doesn't change that our life is a little bit different. I thought about telling him just to have a little more experience, but I had decided to let him know that I felt the same way. I told him I hoped that he wasn't upset that I had decided to go all the way with a woman other than his wife. I don't think he was, and in fact, he wanted me to feel safe and loved as much as I felt I felt I wanted to share myself, and maybe in future, to Brian as wife and lover. He wanted to enjoy his wife as much as I had wanted to be loved. I've never heard my husband say that he didn't want to share me.</p> <p>Brian had been with other women before, and I had always wondered whether I was making a bad choice of partners in our marriage, and I felt that if I was, he would not be disappointed about it. The way she liked to lick his balls, and also a lot of the time she made me cum before she came. As I listened to my husband and my new partner, I felt much better about ourselves, and we had been talking that same way for over a year, and I knew that we both liked the same things to do, and that one day, that way would happen.</p> <p>I know that Brian thought that the more that we had been talking, the more he wanted me and wanted to make himself known to me. I know that in a few minutes, he would have his cock out and ready for me. He wanted me to get wet while we were making love and then give him the best blowjob he ever had. For the first time, at least two men had sucked me off, and I had climaxed as he did. I guess I could feel his orgasm building and he would be ready to release in no time, and I didn't want to get him off any sooner, but after that first afternoon, I didn't want to let him off easy.</p> <p>I felt that it had been time for me to give more than a quick blowjob. It had been hard on him too, that first afternoon having to watch me suck their cock and cum, and seeing him shoot his load in my mouth. I had sucked their cocks all afternoon, swallowing every drop they gave me, and then, during a period when Brian had been gone three or four hours, I had sucked his cock as if I was doing it to make him happy. I loved that feeling of being needed by a wonderful man or being used in any way I could think of for him. It had been the best thing that ever happened to me.</p> <p>I had givenâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
